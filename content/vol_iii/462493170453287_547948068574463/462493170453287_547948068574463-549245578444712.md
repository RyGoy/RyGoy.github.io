   "message": "� Unconditional: In order for a note to be negotiable, it must be unconditional. A condition is a term that makes an obligation to perform dependent on whether or not an uncertain future event happens (Dale Hutchinson (ed) The Law of Contract in South Africa (Cape Town: Oxford University Press South Africa Pty Ltd, 2009) at 448). For examples of where a note will be unconditional, see ss 2(3) and 9(2) of the Bills of Exchange Act.\n\n� Promise: A promise is an undertaking to pay and cannot be anything less. It must be in the imperative form. In LAWSA 2ed (Durban: LexisNexis) vol 19 at para 17 it states: �A promissory note should read �I promise to pay�, �I agree to pay�, �I undertake to pay� and so on.�\n\nAn undertaking to pay will not be implied, as seen in Nawab Major Sir Mohammad Akbar Khan v Attar Singh 1936 2 All ER 545 (PC).\n\nIt is this element that will change an acknowledgment of debt into a promissory note and, thus, close attention must be paid to ensuring that this element is complied with in order for an acknowledgment of debt to become a promissory note.\n\n� In writing: According to s 3 of the Interpretation Act 33 of 1957, writing includes �all � modes of representing or reproducing words in visible form�.\n\n� Addressed by one person to another: According to s (4)1 of the Bills of Exchange Act, the person to whom the promise is made must be named or indicated with reasonable certainty. It may be addressed to more than one person, but not in the alternative (s 4(2) of the Bills of Exchange Act).\n\n� Signature of the promissory: The Bills of Exchange Act does not prescribe any particular form of signature, but the relevant case law gives some indication in this regard. Any mark that identifies the promissory will be sufficient.\n\n� On demand: A note is payable on demand if it is expressed to be so, if it is payable at sight, if it is payable on presentation, or if no time for payment is expressed in it (s 8(1)).\n\n� A fixed future time or a determinable future time: A note is payable at a fixed future time if it is expressed to be payable at a fixed period after the date or on or at the expiration of a fixed period after the occurrence of a specified event that, even though the time of happening may be uncertain, it is certain that it will happen (s 9(1)(a)).\n\n� A certain sum: The amount must be certain or ascertainable ex facie the instrument. If it is necessary to look outside the document for the amount due, then the document is not a negotiable instrument (see Hamman v Van der Merwe [1947] 1 All SA 369 (SWA)).\n\nAccording to s 7(1), an amount is certain although it is payable with interest, by stated instalments, where, on default in payment of any instalment, the whole amount becomes due by provision in the note, or according to a rate of exchange to be indicated or to be ascertained by the note.\n\n� Money: The promise to pay must be for a sum of money and no other thing of value. Should there be any other thing of value promised, then the document containing the promise is not a promissory note (LAWSA 2ed (Durban: LexisNexis) vol 19 at 22).\n\n� To a specified person: The person must be named or otherwise indicated in the bill with reasonable certainty (s 5(1)) (see Barlow Rand Ltd t/a Barlow Noordelik Masjinerie Maatskappy v Self-Arc (Pty) Ltd 1986 (4) SA 488 (T)).\n\nAccording to s 5(2), an instrument can be payable to two or more payees jointly or in the alternative.\n\n� Or his order: A note will be payable to order if it is expressed to be so, or if it is expressed to be payable to a particular person and does not prohibit transfer or transferability of the note (s 6(3)).\n\n� Or to bearer: A note is payable to bearer if it is expressed to be so or if the last endorsement is an endorsement in blank",
