   "message": "However, it may be possible to draft an acknowledgment of debt in such a way that it becomes a negotiable instrument, thus extending the period of prescription.\n\nThis may be the difference between being able to collect on a debt or not.\n\nAcknowledgments of debt\n\nThere are acknowledgments of debt that are only acknowledgments of debt; and others that amount to both an acknowledgment of debt and a promissory note.\n\nThe relevance of this distinction lies in s 11 of the Prescription Act, which provides:\n\n�Periods of prescription of debts\n\nThe periods of prescription of debts shall be the following:\n\n�\n\n(c) six years in respect of a debt arising from a bill of exchange or other negotiable instrument or from a notarial contract, unless a longer period applies in respect of the debt in question in terms of paragraph (a) or (b);\n\n(d) save where an Act of parliament provides otherwise, three years in respect of any other debt.�\n\nWhereas a debt arising from an acknowledgment of debt will prescribe in three years, a promissory note is a negotiable instrument, and a debt arising from a promissory note will prescribe after six years.\n\nThe question then is: When does an acknowledgment of debt amount to a promissory note?",
