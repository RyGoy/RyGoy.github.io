   "message": "The titles \"First Nations\" \"Aboriginal\" are all names created by the gov't., claiming that title has the same effect as me claiming to be a person?\n\nI ask because I want to give this response on a post with this headline \"Prime Minister Harper is seeking to eliminate all First Nations Tribes.\"\n\nHere is the response I want to give, but want to make sure I'm accurate;\n\nThe title \"first nations\" and \"aboriginal\" are names created by the govt ...meaning they are fiction. You are living breathing beings, not legal fictions. The govt created the name so they own it, they can do what they want with it. Detach from their created names, their only power comes from identifying oneself as one of their creations",
