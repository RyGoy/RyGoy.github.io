   "message": "I like Adam, I have heard him out....Frisbey also has a good handle on it too......however, Scott has laid out a very particular plan.  I cannot remember him EVER liking or commenting on Buck o Five or Pete 's BoE stuff.  I don't think its part of the plan.  I think Adam knows his shit and is right IN HIS OWN PLAN.  Therefore, I think a DIFFERENT page is best.  I say this in lieu of liking Adam....I just am not sold that this is the right forum.  :-)  My 2 cents",
