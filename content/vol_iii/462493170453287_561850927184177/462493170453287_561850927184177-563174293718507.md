   "message": "Adam comes across as aggressive & abusive at times, but being a fellow Aussie, I know plenty of guys like this, right or wrong, they are passionate & well meaning, probably just a bit overzealous...\n\nThey're the first to challenge your commitment & Aussies are brutal at taking the piss out of each other & give you a kicking...but they're also the first to have your back when the shit hits the fan too.\n\nMy only two questions that have come out of this are:\n\n1.  Does he have malicious intent?  I don't think so, but then it's not my call.\n\n2.  Does he add value?  Potentially, absolutely.  Out of 400+ 'members' he was at least an active participant.\n\nPeople who make changes in this world generally have big/strong personalities & there are bound to be clashes from time to time.\n\nIf he can maybe tone down the personality a bit, and be a bit clearer in his communication (less kunts n faps), then he could definitely add value, especially on his pet subject, the buck-o-five.\n\nI for one would love to see a logical, backed up validation of this process & where the claims originate from.  That's my 2 cents anyway.",
