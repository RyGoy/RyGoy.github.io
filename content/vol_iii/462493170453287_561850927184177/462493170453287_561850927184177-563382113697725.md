The clarity is incredible..\n\nThis is the photo taken by Port Moody photographer Ronnie Miranda that appeared in the Tri-City News 24-June.\n\nYou can see perfectly the face of every single individual - and there were thousands.\n\nJust think what the police and the military have at their disposal.\n\nhttp://www.gigapixel.com/image/gigapan-canucks-g7.html",
