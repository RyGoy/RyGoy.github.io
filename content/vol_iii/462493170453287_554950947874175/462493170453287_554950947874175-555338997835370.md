   "message": "Nice thread...After getting up to speed, I would suggest that a true Noble would have no problem with being quizzed & questioned by any infant such as Master Happyface Sid, because he is truly a Master, in the context that the master asks the questions & he does not yet have the rights nor the responsibilities to be bound by his actions and/or contracts...nor has he had his values & thinking sullied by adult shitstains.\n\nWhereas we, who think wrong & value the wrong things, need to unlearn or programming in order to even begin to comprehend the power of honestly & innocently questioning and to consequently even approach the understanding of what being a master truly entails.\n\nWelcome Master Happyface Sid, I think we are all going to benefit significantly by your being here :D",
