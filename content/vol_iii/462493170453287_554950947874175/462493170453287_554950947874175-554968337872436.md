   "message": "\"Freemen on the land\" are people who claim that all statute law is contractual, and that such law is applicable only if an individual consents to be governed by it. They believe that they can therefore declare themselves independent of government jurisdiction, holding that the only \"true\" law is common law, as they define it. The \"Freeman on the land\" movement has its origins in various United States-based groups in the 1970s and 1980s, reaching the United Kingdom soon after 2000. The phrase \"Freeman-on-the-Land\" (FOTL) first appeared around 2004 and was coined by Robert Arthur Menard",
