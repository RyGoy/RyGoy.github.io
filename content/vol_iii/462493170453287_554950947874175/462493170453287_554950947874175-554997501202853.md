   "message": "Who knew that Scott Duncan is so good with kids (in a loving, cute, Mr. Grinch sort of way)? \n\nDay one at TFL FOR KIDS\n\nNumerous little monsters get seated and quiet themselves�.\n\nThe teacher appears�\n\nScott Duncan: There is no Santa Clause, EVERY adult is lying to you, and never forget life lesson number 1: You are on your own! \n\nKids start to cry as they WAKE UP TO REALITY. Bawling kids are everywhere. \n\nScott Duncan: Your homework assignment is to find out how all your parents have betrayed you, sold you out, and have had you classified as chattel.\n\nFor Clarification: The above is not meant to provide accurate quotes of Scott Duncan. It is merely a script conjured from my imagination while pondering what the first day of TFL for kids might be like. :)",
