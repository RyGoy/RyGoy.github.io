   "message": "so, district court is up the road. i go ask the magistrate about the federal rules of civil procedure, with regard to the attorney for the plaintiff admitting evidence, who can not be the witness. i learned the witness is 'the COURT', and he said, not defendant but DESPONDANT (which means without hope). so if the plaintiff IS THE COURT, and you NOTICE OF MISTAKE asking THE COURT'S FORGIVENESS the COURT can NOT DENY. pretty simple math if you ask me. and then he said it's up to the judge to accept the complaint, and I said, JUDGE or JUSTICE? and he (the clerk magistrate) replied, judge/justice, they are both the same, the words are interchangeable!\n\nwhich disproves the definition of DESPONDANT doesnt it. notice of mistake IS the HOPE we have all been looking for provided we learn how to properly apply it.\n\nso i need something to print to bring to him that proves he lied to me about that judge/justice meaning he said. anybody?",
