   "message": "The UPU is an incredibly powerful tool they have used against us for a looonngg time $2 G.I.\nWE USE IT AGAINST THEM TO BIND THEM TO THEIR LEGAL FICTION.\nIt actually holds judges on an incredibly tight leash because if they make the claim it's not legal tender or lawful currency then he pays so he now shuts the fuck up & backs the fuck off & will let the prosecution take the fall for it INSTEAD.\nIf you make a mistake Not one fuck does it matter as all ye do is say sorry for being a real clever kunt & ASK where the mistake was made?? This re sets the clock back in your favour as there's every chance in the book that the majority of your magistrates & County Court judges will not have a fucking clue as to where ye went wrong either... Let them pull shit from their own asses & then watch a judge hang himself.\nBEAUTIFUL SHIT TO SEE....S I G H .....Yes... I would like to see this...secret fantasy o mine ye could say.....indeed.",
