   "message": "Stamps are simply one of many options to setoff or discharge a debt. They are a tangible form of consideration to the system in that they are backed by the Swiss gold coin (forget the name)...So if you offer the stamped instrument as a tender for said debt and its not returned within 72hrs with a certificate of dishonor or a notice of defect in the instrument it has been accepted and there is discharge.  The real question of importance with all these remedies imo then is can you hold them in honor under testing and pressure, coz that's a given:-) and where most seem to crack or go into dishonor/acceptance/consent.
