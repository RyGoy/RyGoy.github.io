   "message": "Q. What is a Notice of Fault and Opportunity to Cure and why do I need to use one?  A. A Notice of Fault and Opportunity to Cure is correct procedure and therefore gives the Affiant uncompromised standing. There may be a very genuine reason why the Respondent couldn�t respond; maybe a death in the family, maybe they were hospitalized etc. So you are saying, �just in case there is a genuine reason why you couldn�t respond I am kindly granting you a further three (3) days to respond. You are being nice, and so you should be, as you want to stay honourable at ALL times.",
