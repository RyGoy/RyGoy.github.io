I may not get buck o fives, but I certainly know American law, American history, the story of the enslavement of the sovereigns, and history of currency in America.  I am no expert, but I am no novice.  Frisbey has displayed to me complete ignorance of it.  I have nothing left to say.  Frisbey, I hope the Notice of Mistake does everything you think it will!",
