   "message": "Last question sent July 17th 2013\n\nGood Morning Mr. Flaherty\n\nI am in a process of educating myself on WHO I am, I�ve been studying the subject for almost 2 years now, and INVESTED 2 to 3 hours a day,  and I take it VERY seriously, after being literally attacked by Revenu Quebec Agency, I�ve made that decision that I will know EVERYTHING I need to know about ME, I mean EVERYTHING.\n\nAnd, according to my studies, YOU have the position of M.P. Minister of Finance in Canada to serve ME, and other people in Canada.\n\nIf ever I�m wrong, just let me know and I will never contact you again.\n\nSo I have one and only one question for you.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms article 7.\n\n7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\nSo MY QUESTION TO YOU IS: What is the Security of the Person ?\nThanks in advance for your answer, I do recognize and fully accept your OATH of office.\nPierre Daoust\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED",
