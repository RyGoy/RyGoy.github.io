Later.\n\nTHAT \"All acts of legislature apparently contrary to natural right and justice are, in our laws and must be in the nature of things, considered as void. The laws of nature are the laws of God; whose authority can be superseded by no power on earth. A legislature must not obstruct our obedience to him from whose punishments they cannot protect us. All human constitutions which contradict his laws, we are in conscience bound to disobey. Such have been the adjudications of our courts of justice.\" (Robin v. Hardaway, 1 Jefferson 109, 114 (1772)). \n Here are two: 1.) \"This law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity if contrary to this; ... upon these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human laws should be suffered to contradict these\" � William Blackstone, The Commentaries of the Law of England, Volume I, \"Of the Rights of Persons,\" at 41 (1765); and 2.) �The institutions of our society are founded on the belief that there is an authority higher than the authority of the State; that there is a moral law which the State is powerless to alter; that the individual possesses rights, conferred by the Creator, which government must respect. The Declaration of Independence stated the now familiar theme: �We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.� And the body of the Constitution as well as the Bill of Rights enshrined those principles.� McGowan v. Maryland, 366 US 420, 563, Supreme Court (1961). Both of these are found in Glassroth v. Moore, 229 F. Supp. 2d 1290 - Dist. Court, MD Alabama 2002 describing the inscriptions on the removed monument.\n \"The essence of our free Government is \"leave to live by no man's leave, underneath the law\"�to be governed by those impersonal forces which we call law. Our Government is fashioned to fulfill this concept so far as humanly possible. The Executive, except for recommendation and veto, has no legislative power.\" Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 US 579, 655, Supreme Court (1952).",
