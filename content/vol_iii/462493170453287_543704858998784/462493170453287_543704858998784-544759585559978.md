   "message": "I have had the same problem here, in NS. I got a few through with one postie that wasn't a return address Nazi, but there is this bitch that everytime I get her, I have to argue with her. It turns out now that even if they don't accept the registered mail (and it has happened with the RCMP) that you now have to pay another $ 10.00 + to get it back.
