   "message": "Pete Daoust If i get mad at you and knife your tire, causing it to go flat, what was the amount I agreed to be liable for Pete?  $15.00 because it's an old tire? $5,000.00 because it's your favourite tire. Or, maybe I contracted to owe you $5,000,000.00 because I am now bound to pay you any price you ARBITRARILY decide to put on it? :(",
