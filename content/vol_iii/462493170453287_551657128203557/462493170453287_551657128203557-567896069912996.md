   "message": "How did the cops accept that damaging David Smile would cost eleventy billion? Or $6,000.00 or $6.95?. When did David tell them his fee schedule before they wronged him? As far as I know, he never gave them a price to which they could choose to proceed, and wrong him, or not proceed and drive away. They wronged him (stole his Big Mac). So now the people who injured him (stole his big mac) get an invoice claiming the big mac is worth eleventy billion, or $6000.00, or any other price they choose, even though David's Burger Shack never posted any prices on their board so that the cops could know the value of what they were stealing? Fuck I'm confused.",
