   "message": "Pete Daoust - You might want to be careful about providing only 4 or 5 days for the party to respond to you. While you may be right legally, it may be difficult to get a court to support such summary judgements as it may appear to them as being the workings of someone who isn't fair. I have had ChiefRock Sino General 's help with some of this stuff. I pushed for 4 to 5 day responses too and he suggested 30 days to show good will. For one of my NOTICES, he recommends giving 90 days to demonstrate that i'm an extremely accommodating person in law who is more than fair. In summary 4 to 5 days = unfair, mean spirited guy. 30 days = nice guy who puts some real effort to be fair and accommodating. 90 days= unarguably fair and just man bending backward to give every chance possible to a slime ball",
