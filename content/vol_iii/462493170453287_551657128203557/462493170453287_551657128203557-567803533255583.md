   "message": "In \"normal\" business there is a PO or a signed invoice etc accepting all your terms of contract. This seems a little different in my mind. Did the cops sign something with David Smile that they agree to any and all terms that he might wish to impose upon him at a future date? Maybe I'm confused. Maybe I've missed something. I'm here to learn. I'm just thinking it may not be as simple as a typical business transaction with a signed invoice etc. :(",
