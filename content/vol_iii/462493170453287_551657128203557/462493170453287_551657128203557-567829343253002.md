   "message": "While that may be true, EQUITY and EQUITABLE TREATMENT (or non-equitable treatment) may have something to do with the outcome here in reality. For example; even some of the \"gurus' such as Dean who's been at this for 17 or so years for example, may be 100% right (although using different tactics). As much as Dean is \"right\" beyond a shadow of a doubt, so to speak, here in reality he has had two or three trucks taken from him, spent 20 something days in jail, doesn't get his 2 or 3 vehicles  back and in the end considers it a BIG WIN when they drop the charges and don't compensate him. While he may secure summary judgements worth ELEVENTY BILLION dollars, in reality, according to Scott (if I understand correctly), he will never see a dime and will never get the justice he so very much is deserves.",
