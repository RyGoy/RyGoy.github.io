   "message": "I think I get it now. The cops walk up to David Smile and cause him damage. They think they can because David hasn't given them PROPER NOTICE with HOURLY RATES for Dealing with such matters. David just can't send them a bill for what happened in the past and declare an ARBITRARY rate for what has happened to him in the PAST. If he wants to send them a bill for doing such things in the FUTURE, he needs to send them a PROPER NOTICE through the POST with his HOURLY RATES. Once there is PROOF (RECEIPT confirmation from the POST), from that point in time (HENCEFORTH) and from that point in time forward (FUTURE) he can now bill for his stated HOURLY RATES. :)",
