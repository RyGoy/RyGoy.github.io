   "message": "The pigs have arbitrary authority, they could have chose to let me go rather than force me into contract. I am free from arbitrary interference in my home and correspondence. I stated several times that I am free from arbitrary interference, am I free to go. The pigs chose to arbitrarally detain me to extort a name, they witnessed no crime, no breach of the peace, a polite peace officer would inform that I could get injured by not wearing a helmet and send on my way. But we are not dealing with peace officers, we are dealing with her Majesties arms, whom each hold arbitrary power.",
