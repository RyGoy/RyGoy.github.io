   "message": "My intent is to lien the 2 peace officers. I would like keep this thread to the process of lienning public officers. I need to gather this public record so I have evidence of a breach of the trust. When I do collect this evidence, I'll file a lien and send copies w/affidavit to the underwriter. I will be claiming $6000.00 in damages from each officers bond as per my bill of exchange/fee schedule. Is this even possible ? I have no desire to make a claim in the court as there is no remedy or relief in that venue.",
