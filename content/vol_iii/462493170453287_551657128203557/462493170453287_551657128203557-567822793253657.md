   "message": "starting an administrative process is equivalent to a contract offer. it's a 3 step process, each step of the process  the other party is given time to counter offer the original offer...the public court isn't there to decide if the one party made a good contract or not...its there to enforce the summary judgement. \n\nIf the cops sue David, that is a whole different separate matter?",
