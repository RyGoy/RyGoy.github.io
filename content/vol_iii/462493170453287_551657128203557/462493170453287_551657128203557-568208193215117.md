   "message": "According to a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in a case called R. v. Mann, the police have no right or power to stop you unless they have reasonable grounds to believe you may have been involved in a criminal offence. So, The shit stains had zero right to stop me and force me to accept their contract. List of charges 1. Forceable Confinement 2. Battery and aggravated assault 3. Criminal Breach of the Trust 4. Extortion. The bill will be larger that the 6000.00 closer to 30.000.",
