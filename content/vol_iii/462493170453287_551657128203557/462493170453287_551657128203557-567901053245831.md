Notice + invoice will at least cover proper notice in the FUTURE (my all caps). I understand that to mean that you can send them an invoice/bill if they do it again in the FUTURE because once you serve them a proper notice with your hourly rates included, HENCEFORTH (not back dating for stuff that happened in the PAST) but HENCEFORTH (from that point forward), IF they cause harm again you can send them an invoice/bill for your previously stated/advertised hourly rate.",
