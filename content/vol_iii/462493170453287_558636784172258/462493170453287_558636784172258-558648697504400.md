   "message": "Then all the laws,acts and statutes apply to all Canadians and trying to say they don't because we are not government agents is moot! Then your only recourse when dealing with tyrannical authority is not to claim surety for the Birth certificate.Anything else is appealing to your rapist or recreating the wheel.Then becoming a freeman would be a \"belief\" and would entail the indoctrination of a large group of fellow believers to reach a tipping point where a majority of said believer could execute change as they see fit at the same time becoming the rapist to the new minority!",
