   "message": "I have an interesting situation with my birth cert(s). I have 2 completely different ones. The first one was issued to my mother and my name is not in all caps, with her family name as mine. There is also NO red number anywhere on the cert. BUT I am pretty sure my grandpa was NOT a WW2 vet. The second, on the other hand, was issued a year later (my father came into the picture and married my mother) and HIS father WAS a WW2 vet (fighter pilot). However, my name IS in all caps on this one and there is the red number in the corner. Both certs are blank on the back.",
