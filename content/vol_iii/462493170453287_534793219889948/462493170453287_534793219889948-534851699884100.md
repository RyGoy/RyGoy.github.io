   "message": "Children of Canadian military personnel deceased for more than 20 years can have limited access to their father's or mother's military records provided they have proof of relationship and / or obituary. The proof of relationship is a birth certificate with father's name included (which is often not available to War Children unfortunately). Living military personnel can also access their own files.",
