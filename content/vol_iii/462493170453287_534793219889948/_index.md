   "message": "Scott on the significance of Birth Certificates issued to Children and Grandchildren of VETERAN OFFICERS of WW2- thread. . . . .\n\nLeigh OftheHouseof Collins: I have two different birth certificates issued. Both with different letters and numbers. One legal name spelled all caps and the other does not. Is there a reason why? Do I have two persons?\n\nScott Duncan: Names on Birth certificates that are NOT in ALL CAPS and have a BLANK BACK were issued to the Children and Grandchildren of VETERAN OFFICERS of WW2.\n\nLeigh OftheHouseof Collins: 'Birth certificates that are NOT in ALL CAPS and have a BLANK BACK were issued to the Children and Grandchildren of VETRAN OFFICERS of WW2.' Does that entitle me to something more? And why did they not issue the same one when requested, instead of an ALL CAPS name?\n\nScott Duncan: The \"VETERAN'S Offspring\" version (It has no official name) gives you BENEFIT, without liability.",
