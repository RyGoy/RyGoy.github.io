   "message": "I watched this movie the other night which I though some of you may like the premise.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2150511/\nChristopher creates the website THE LIST. On this site, users can label corrupt individuals in public life and award them points as to how much of a menace they are. The result is a list of politicians, CEOs and bankers. The website quickly becomes a worldwide success but suddenly, whoever is number one on THE LIST appears murdered and public opinion starts to turn against Christopher.",
