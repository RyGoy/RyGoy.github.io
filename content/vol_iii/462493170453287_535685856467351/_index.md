   "message": "A SHEEP NO MORE ï¿½>> I ran into one of these today at the Sprint store. The person who worked with me was going to college and working over the summer. Because my old phone had died and was a dinosaur (I wanted it to be non GPS on purpose), he presumed to think I was of course, useless.\n\nSo I decided to ask him some questions. Do you know about the FED and what it is. He replied, of course, it's a part of the US government and is regulated. I said really? Then asked, and how about the $40 billion the FED is printing every month ....it's now called Q3? He said, the FED is regulated that when any new money is printed, the old money must be destroyed. Final question was about 9/11. When I asked if he believed the government's version of it and some other important facts, he said....oh yeah, ha ha .....you're one of those conspiracy theorist.\n\nObviously this young man is still stuck in the matrix as he smirked at my much older than his face.\n\nThen he had the balls to ask me if I ever attended college (like that means anything while he's paying for his education using loans that have doubled in interest ...so he'll be a debt slave once he graduates and will spend his entire life paying it back). I replied by saying, does that really matter? But, just for your information, I do have a BA in psychology (and my final payment on my loan ended when I was 31) .... and I went on to get my masters later in life until I realized it wouldn't be worth it, and I quit after 2 semesters.\n\nBut don't worry, because he KNOWS he is going make a lotta money once he graduates college. That's the majority of AmeeriKa's youth today. Sad to say, but they are just as brainwashed and propagated as the baby boomer generation.",
