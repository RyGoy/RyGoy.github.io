   "message": "Gail Blackman - your first notice should contain your counter offer with terms and conditions. 2nd notice is simply due process/notice of fault - offer to cure. 3rd notice is the default - summary judgement. Court adjourned. This then is your agreement between the parties - contract - private record that can be testified to by affidavit in the public. Then you just have to hold onto it:-) amidst a tag team verbal wrestle test (plaintiff/judge).",
