Once you have an �Order of Possession� from the Residential Tenancy Branch, served your tenant, and they have not moved out by the date of order, you can then file for a Writ of Possession from the Supreme Court to evict your tenant and sign over peaceful possession to you. \n\nI have an agreement with my landlord to pay back rent from when i was sick as long as i kept current. I have fulfilled my agreement he has handed me a eviction notice for 10 days.",
