   "message": "My understanding is that the UK is debating a private members bill \"Provide a system of national service for young persons; and for connected purposes.\" \n\nIn the above description they use the word PERSONS, but in the description they use the words \"participant\" and \"individual\"\n\nindividual, adj. (I5c) 1. Existing as an indivisible entity.\n2. Ofor relating to a single person or thing, as opposed\nto a group.\n\nWhat is PARTICIPANT?\n\nAny person who takes part in any activity, service or program.\n\nSo are they getting sly or are these other words used because it's a private members bill and not law yet? http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2013-2014/0032/cbill_2013-20140032_en_2.htm",
