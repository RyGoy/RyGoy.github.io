   "message": "I'm the most marxist human you will ever meet. Once an idea is expressed, it belongs to the world. \"Intellectual Property\"= \"Imaginary Property\". Ideas come from the imagination.\n\nPatent trolls leverage credit attached to an idea, and use a corrupt legal framework to enforce it.\n\nhttp://michaelgeist.ca/ is the best source for the bullshit \"intellectual property\" concept and the damage it causes to us as a society.\n\nThere's NO SUCH THING AS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.",
