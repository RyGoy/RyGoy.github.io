   "message": "glad you liked Stuart Stuart , i took the breaches of procedure outlined put them in commercial affidavit & pointed them at the director of a prosecuting bank last year, the master sent it for summary hearing, the affidavits stood & removed the ability for that justice to deal with, they then tried to invite a\"common law defence\" without filing a claim lol.
