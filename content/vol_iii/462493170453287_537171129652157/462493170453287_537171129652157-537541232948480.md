   "message": "Isn't it the case we have all these groups in Ireland who through some self sense of righteousness feel they can fix things without understanding them, i have flash-backs of an old next door neighbour who had a fetish for power tools but no mentality for them, everything he touched ended up in bits, he was just as incapable of heeding warnings or taking on board his lack of ability,He would instantly offer \"EXPERT\" advice to anyone who'd listen lol he never acknowledged the mess he made.... so nothing ever changed. Thats why you didn't get the correct response Kevin,the probing questions & hunger to get to the truth doesn't exist & thats the only thing that truly matters?. They all run from debate because their logic in this doesn't wear well, they are protecting what they already \"believe\" afraid there might be something they didn't know or  might have to admit about themselves. They are misleading people.",
