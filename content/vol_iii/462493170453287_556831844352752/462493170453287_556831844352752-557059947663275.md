   "message": "\"we would all be entitled to a portion of the value of Canada (the Trust?)\"? - No.\n\nYou are either detaching yourself from the NAME, or you aren't. You did not invent and/or commission ANYTHING to do with commerce.\n\nYou had no hand in the creation of the name.\n\nLet's look at a real world example: Tony \"Sounds-like-he's-got-a-dick-in-his-mouth\" Butros, had no hand in the creation, use, or value of the \"Sounds-like-he's-got-a-dick-in-his-mouth\" label, I so graciously bestowed on him. The fact that he SOUNDS like he's got a dick in his mouth, only gives value (validates) my label of \"Sounds-like-he's-got-a-dick-in-his-mouth\".\n\nHe can't demand payment for the use of \"Sounds-like-he's-got-a-dick-in-his-mouth\", despite the fact that he just happens to sound like he's got a dick in his mouth! :P\n\n It gives him NO claim to a label I bestowed on him.\n\n...That would be as stupid as Canadian Tire claiming trademark to \"Crappy Tire\"!   \n\n...oh wait.\n\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2001/05/31/crappytire_010531.html\n\n...law cracks me up. :D\n\nAnyway, I hope this sinks into your girl-brain. You did not make the name. You did not invent the monetary system. You did not make the TENDER FOR LAW that money provides. You aren't suddenly entitled to the equity.",
