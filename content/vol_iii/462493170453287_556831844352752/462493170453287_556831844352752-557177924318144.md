   "message": "Jeff is correct...a lien is a claim, most  never rebut it or have it validated, they can be removed  most even  file notice of lien and the agents treat as if it is a lien which it is not, it is only a notice..many can be removed by rebuttal or request of validation of debt ( lien). It is no different than a pirate with letters of marque from the king taking your property under the kings authority..you are at war! and  they treat you as such by claiming you are in their  territorial waters subject to thier jurisdiction, [as it were]  if you were to seek remedy with the internatioal  court they would say too bad..rules of war...because  you have said\" YES I AM THE NAME(surety) \" this is why they come afer you..you have claimed their property by operation..and by not keeping the ledgers on the name( thier commercial property) balanced they come after you to correct it since you said you were it!.who gave you permission to use that name?..you assumed it (they tricked you)..and they let you cause use it but when you fuck up the books they come after you to correct it... Remember the meaning of usufruct?..you use the earth under the rule of usufruct...it IS not yours, you only have the right use it..",
