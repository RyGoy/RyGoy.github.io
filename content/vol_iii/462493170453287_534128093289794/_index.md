   "message": "Ok, time for a real life example:\n\nI wrote a bill for the return of my creditor's deposit/irregular deposit of a valuable security (credit agreement pertaining to a mortgage that has since been completed) & received a letter of reply from their lawyer:\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are instructed by SSSSSSSSS (mortgage company).\nWe have been asked to respond to your letter dated 24 June 2013, concerning account AAAAAAAAA (Account number).\n\nOn or about 30 July 2001 SSSSSSSSSSS made a loan to you of �XXXXX by way of mortgage.  In consideration of the loan you promised to repay the principal amount along with interest at the agreed rate and you executed a mortgage deed in favour of SSSSSSSSS that authorised them to register a first legal charge against the property known as (property), by way of security for its loan.\nThe mortgage deed is made out in accordance with s.52 of the Law of Property Act 1925.\n\nAs your letter explains, you repaid the loan in full on or around August 2003, discharging your liability with SSSSSSSSS, who then released its security for the loan by removing its charge against the property, at which point the relationship came to an end.\n\nIn light of the above, the position adopted in your letter dated 24 June 2013 appears ill conceived and misguided.\n  \nIf you should remain of the view that you have a claim against SSSSSSSSSS, then no doubt you will make such application to the courts as you deem appropriate.  However, before taking such a step, we would strongly urge you to take independent legal advice.\n\nFinally, for the avoidance of any doubt, SSSSSSSS considers its position is clear an unequivocally set out in this letter and will not enter into any further correspondence with you about this matter,\n\nYours faithfully,\n(name of legal firm)\n\nMy draft response (not sent as yet) \n\n8 July 2013\n\nDear (lawyer),\nRe: Your Ref: \n\nThank you for your letter dated 4 July 2013, however there appears to be a misunderstanding.\n\nTo put it bluntly, I am confused.  Who are you referring to as �you�?\n\nThe �you� that you are referring to appears to refer to an entity known as the �customer�.  I am not communicating with you, or �SSSSSS� in the capacity of a customer or former customer.  The �you� you are referring to is not me, nor am I to be addressed as �Mr� as it is not a title that pertains to me.\n\nI wrote to �SSSSSSSS� in relation to the deposit of a valuable security with them, that coincided on or about the time of them creating a customer account (number AAAAAAAAAAA).  In this instance, you will notice that I am acting in the capacity of a creditor who made an irregular deposit by way of a bill of exchange (hereinafter �valuable security�).\n\nThe irregular deposit of the valuable security was accepted and or deposited by �SSSSSS� and coincided on or about the time of the creation of the customer account (number AAAAAAAAAAA) as mentioned in my correspondence dated 24 June 2013.\n \nIf you re-read the letter accompanying the invoice, it will become very clear.  The primary reason for my referring to the account number was to give �SSSSSSS� a reference point for locating the funds that were deposited with them by me on or about 30 July 2001.\n\nSo, any reference by either you or �SSSSSS� regarding customer dealings bear no relation to me and are of no consequence.  I merely wish to withdraw the funds that were deposited by way of valuable security for the sum of �XXXXX with �SSSSSS� on or about 30 July 2001.  \n\nI have provided sufficient details for �SSSSSS� to be able to locate the details of my irregular deposit and return these funds to me as directed and I will be dealing with this matter in the manner as set out in my correspondence dated 24 June 2013. \n \nI am willing to swear an affidavit to the facts, and, if �SSSSSS� wishes to acquiesce through their silence by not entering into any further correspondence as mentioned in your letter, then there will be no controversy that any court needs to address as there will be agreement between the parties.\nI trust that this clarifies matters for you,\n\nStuart Stone, Authorised Representative\nNon Assumpsit, All Rights Reserved\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated",
