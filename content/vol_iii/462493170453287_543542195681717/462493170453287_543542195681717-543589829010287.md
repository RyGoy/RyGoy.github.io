   "message": "I have been at this for twenty years, since the state kidnapped my two little boys, and gave them to their incompetant mother, so they could skim off child support payments, and ive beat to many cases to count, asking for as many as could catch since that time, except one. That would be the federal case in 2001. I had been doing acid and coke for weeks straight before 911. And as I watched the towers fall, I called up a judge in michigan, presiding over my divorce case, and threatened to put his head in vise if he didnt do something about my ex hiding my kids from me and violating my parenting time order. I did three years for interstate communication of threat to injure, and have had a vendetta against corperate child trafficking rings and attorneys ever since",
