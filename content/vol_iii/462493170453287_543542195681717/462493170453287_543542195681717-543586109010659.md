   "message": "AFFIDAVIT OF INABILITY TO PAY COST AND FEES\nAN UNREBUTTED AFFIDAVIT STANDS AS TRUTH IN COMMERCE\nBeing Duly deposed and Sworn, Affiant, autographed in Blue and sealed by thumb print in red ink below, states as follows:\nI can make no Payment on any debt or obligation to pay pursuant to costs, fees, any contract, settlement, or order of the court, until the form of payment is clarified and defined, considering the following :\nFACT ONE\nNeither paper currency nor deposits have value as commodities, as deposits are merely book entries, and it is still a Felony to tender these or any such substitute, electronically or otherwise for lawful money in many States today including Texas. As Texas criminal law states �All recognizances, bail bonds & undertakings of any kind, whereby a party becomes bound to pay money to the State, & all fines & forfeitures of a pecuniary character shall be collected in the lawful money [gold or silver, not legal tender federal Reserve Notes] of the United States only.� TEXAS Code of Criminal Procedure � 43.02. the Supreme Court has ruled that \"Lawful Money of the United States could only be gold & silver coin or that which by law is made its equivalent so as to be exchangeable therefor at par, & on demand, & does NOT include a currency which though nominally exchangeable for coin at its� face value, is not redeemable on demand.\" Bronson v. Rhodes, 74 U.S. 229, 247, 19 L. Ed.141. �Checks, drafts, money orders & bank notes are not lawful money of the United States.\" (State v. Mellon, 73 Pac. 321, 43 Ore. 168. Black�s Law Dictionary 6th Edition defines �Real money,� as; �Money which has real metallic, intrinsic value as distinguished from paper currency, checks & drafts.�\nFACT TWO\nNo state may make any thing but gold or silver coin tender in payment of debts (Article 1 sec 10, US Constitution), yet no payment in gold or silver may be demanded in payment of any debt or obligation because of government declared bankruptcy. ( HJR 192; Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111, and 6260, House Joint Resolution 192 of June 5, 1933; 31 USC 5112, 5119;12 USC 95a; confirmed in  Perry v. U.S. 294 U.S. 330-381, 79 LEd 912 (1935)).\nFACT THREE\n\"The legal tender quality of paper money is only valuable for the purposes of dishonesty.\" (Knox v. Lee 79 U.S. 457 (1871) \" and By agreeing to pay fines, court costs, or any other obligation or debt in monetary exchange or commerce with any public institution by such means, weather or not being tricked or coerced by rogue government or any representative thereof into paying any debt, obligation, or fine, in anything other than gold or silver, one would be as such either pressured, intimidated, coerced and threatened or induced under duress, drawn into, or conspiring to engage in the crime of 'counterfeiting' and forgery, a felony, and so should and must respectfully decline and resist any pressure to accept any offer and reject, any inducement to be pressured or drawn into contributing, aiding and abetting, weather directly or indirectly, any manner of criminality, such as defined in and by law as 'forgery' and the 'counterfeiting' of money or value.\nFACT FOUR\n�No person shall ever be imprisoned for debt.� - Constitution of the State of Texas Art. 1 � 18, 1876. �No man can give that which he has not... [nor that which he can not be required to have, such as contraband Federal Reserve Bank Notes counterfeited as money].� (Jackson v. Bradford, 4 Wend. (N.Y.) 619). �Incarceration to coerce bond is unconstitutional.� (Pullman v.
