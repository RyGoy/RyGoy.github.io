   "message": "THAT when pressured to identify the form of money to be used to settle a judgment, the 52nd 3rd Judicial District Court of Michigan, Honorable Justice James P. Sheehy presiding, Ruled that \"coffee beans\" was money, storming out of the court room shouting : \"I donï¿½t care if you pay it in coffee beans just so long as you pay it!\" (Montgomery Wards v Eugene Glasure case #82-002087 (1982). The judge, as in many intentionally unpublished state and federal cases, could not bring himself to violate the law in open court on record and declare Federal Reserve Notes to be lawful tender in payment of debts, so Glasure, a Michigan Native, member of the Michigan Militia and personal friend of this Writer, payed the settlement, court costs, and a few of his other debts, in \"Coffee Beans,\" and still carries a large sack of them around with him at all times down to this very day. The Writer prefers to pay such debts in fertilizer, by promissory note, you can come drain out of my septic tank at your convenience.",
