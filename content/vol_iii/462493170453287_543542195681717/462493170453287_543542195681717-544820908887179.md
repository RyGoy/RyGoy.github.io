He had a mate in his show called 'strop'. Twas from the 70's era.\nAnothet meaning of the word strop comes from olden days when ye visited your local barber for a shave & haitcut. When he was to shave ye he tan the blade of his cutthroat against a leather belt to sharpen it & the sound was similiar in the sound of the word except gor the 'P' of course. The leather belt eas called the mulligan....\nIt is also aussie slang for being a WANKER OR PULLING ON YOUR COCK TOO MUCH & TOO LONG JUST LIKE DEREK SUCKS-ON-COCK-HILL, DOES A LOT TOO MUCH OF & TOO FREQUENTLY TOO.",
