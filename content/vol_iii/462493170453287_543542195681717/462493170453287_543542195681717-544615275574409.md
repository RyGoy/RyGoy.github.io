   "message": "BIRTH CERTIFICATE SUBMITTED AS EVIDENCE OF SLAVE TRADE IN AMERICA\n\n Since 1933 every new child born has been required to be �registered�, thereby creating a Corporate Person in leagality, subject to legalism in courts of leagality, the doctrin of corperate fictions, ghosts dead to natural rights, and not Law, effectively denying that child any rights as a citzen protected by the Bill of Rights, or owner of Real Property you might be surprised to learn. On or about the same time, President Roosevelt, quietly through Congress claimed all property, both real and living, to be \"subordinate to the interest of government,\" effectively seizing elodial and equitable title (as distict from legal title) to all property, including the people themselves, so that the government might borrow there upon the same serving as surety and collateral, for loans from international bankers, in violation of the 4th (The right of the people to be secure in their persons) the 5th ( nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation), the 10th ( a right not delagated by the constitution) and 13th Amendment (prohibiting slavery). In abrogation of these, Senate Document No. 43, 73rd Congress, 1st Session: �The ownership of all property is in the State; individual so called �ownership� is only by virtue of Government, ie. Law, amounting to mere user; and use must be in accordance with law and subordinate to the necessities of the State.� Of course, this is in and of itself completely unlawful.\n Roosevelt's unlicensed lawyer and top economic ad-visor, Col. Edward Mandell House, in support of the plan for econmoic enslavement of the entire population by clever leagal means in violation of law has been quoted as saying : \"...[E]very American will be required to register their biological property in a National system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient (admiralty Maritime) system of pledging (themselves as contribution or tribute to government)... By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will affect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency. Every American will be forced to register (by birth certificate, social security card, and drivers licence) or suffer not being able to work and earn a living. They will be our chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions ( or presumed obligations in statutory jurisdiction in corperate courts). This will inevitably... leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call 'Social Insurance.' \"\n\nArticle Three of the Constitution establishes the judiciary for the people, fully vested with their rights. Article One and Four establish the executive and legislative branch, which can create \"administrative courts,\" that mimic law courts with legality, legalese, and leagalism (religion teaches is black magic, witchraft and sophistry - or, the art of lying) to handle internal government affairs of employees and agents of government, who have no more rights than military personnel who have signed stewardship and ownership of themselves over to government, to be treated as \"wards\" you might say. All Article Three Courts, which are empowered to recognize your rights as a free citizen, have been entirely supplanted, and replaced since the Civil War and the Great Depresion, with Aticle One, and Article Four, Legislative or Executive branch administrative courts, all the way down to your local circuit, district, or municiple state court, and their operations have aditionally been Privatised, to create a role reversal between you and government, to treat you, the private person, as a public institution, subject to the legaleese of fictions, while the government operates as a private corperation, masquerading as a public institution. These courts cannot recognize the rights of a person not employed, or owned by government. \n\nThe general misconception is that any statute passed by legislators bearing the appearance of law constitutes the law of the land. A \"Statute\" is not a \"law,\" (Flournoy v. First Nat. Bank of Shreveport, 197 La. 1067, 3 So.2d 244, 248), and a concurrent or joint resolution of legislature is not \"a law,\" (Koenig v. Flynn, 258 N.Y. 292, 179 N.E. 705, 707; Ward v. State, 176 Okl. 368, 56 P.2d 136, 137; State ex rel. Todd v. Yelle, 7 Wash.2d 443, 110 P.2d 162, 165), Nor is 'Code' \"Law\" (In Re Self v Rhay, 61 Wn (2d) 261) these being defined by Black's Law Dictionary as rebuttable prima facie, or superficial, evidence of law, a facade, represented by 'public policy,' being color-able, or 'color of law,' being 'counterfeit or feigned' as defined. As the Supreme Court has warned, \"Because of what appear to be Lawful commands on the surface, many citizens, because of their respect for what appears to be law, are cunningly coerced into waiving their rights, due to ignorance.\" ( U.S. v. Minker, 350 U.S. 179, 187 ). The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and any inferior federal or state act, code, title or statute, derived from or predicated upon the original contract for government, to be valid, must be In agreement therewith. - 16 Am Jur 2d, Sec 177 late 2d, Sec 256. \n\nThe courts today operate on the presumption that you are owned by government, (chattle property) an 'asset', or 'human resource', an agent, representative, or employee, an 'office,' or 'department' of government, only by the birth certificate, and other 'Union' memberships they have created for you,  a contract for slavery, that you never knowingly and intentionally signed, bearing your foot prints.
