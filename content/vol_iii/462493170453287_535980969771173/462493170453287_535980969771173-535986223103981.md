   "message": "Scott, I am NOT working for Government, Nor Law Agency of any kind. I have friends in all walks of life though and I get along with all of them. Not a crime to get along. I am an entrepreneur- business man that was rudely awakened by CRA and it forced me to educate myself ( wake up ). I am Toronto born...I started learning by watching John from Montreal....then Dean.....then YOU. I feel that you are one amazing individual, great sense of humor.... what do I want? I want to continue to learn from your teachings, I want to be able to contribute to help our society be a better place by understanding what is going on out there.......and Thank You for being You!",
