   "message": "As long as I can remember, I've always felt like the boss of me. I could never understand why others  always tried.  I have always been a student of experience, so needless to say I get a little dirty in my learning. \nFor the first part of my life, I was able to stay under the radar. My 20's were a blur and start growing up at thirty. This is where things start to get harder. \nI'm now 45. Happily married. Father of 5 chillins ages 3,6,7,10 and 11. Am self employed. I'm not caught up in bling bling, manage to meet our needs most of the time.\nI'm clearly not educated enough to deal with the system. CRA is wanting to take me to the cleaners for an outrageous amount of money.    \nI'm watching everything around me decay to a wrong system of living and I'm trying to make sure I can educate myself so could teach my kids and others.\nSo I've got my PC/FB open to jan 8th, printed test #7 and reading and looking up words. Hoping I could catch up so I could get involve in the discussions because I have been enjoying what I've been reading.",
