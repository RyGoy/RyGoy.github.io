   "message": "Beverly Girl-Brain Braaksma Robert, whats going on with the car CLAIM? You enforcing it?  This seems to be a PRIVATE matter as the PUBLIC CAPS names have now SIGNED the registration to release the trust of the property to me. Therefore, in my estimation, my breathing  trust must make a Claim to the PROPERTY without interference from  CORPORATIONS unless i consent. Could evolve into a CRA dispute, should they wish to make presumptions about my personal affairs. Hmm",
