   "message": "Ok, for at the BARE MINIMUM you have been \"dead\" for as long as multicellular life has existed..then you were alive...and one day you won't be. You have already BEEN dead.\n\nDo a RAM dump to a file, and then turn off your computer. Turn it on again and see if the RAM is \"restored\" to it's previous state. IT ISN'T. There's no fucking SPIRIT that will keep its previous state...and that is just the LIMITED STATE of binary. Neural Networked processing is even MORE volatile.\n\nWhat you are \"believing\" and theorizing about \"conciousness\" is the result of years of carefully NOT STUDYING ANYTHING REAL! In many ways, the Buddhist mindset is evil. This is \"pseudo-thinking\". It's designed to remove feeling, and dull the ones it cant wipe out. Especially EMPATHY.\n\nNO RELIGION OR PHILOSOPHY HAS YOUR ANSWERS. TAKE IT ELSEWHERE IF YOU DISAGREE! I DON'T CARE. WRONG IS WRONG. PRETENDING IT ISN'T WITH MEANINGLESS (Yes they are meaningless, and have NO basis in reality) QUESTIONS WASTES TIME. THAT'S WHY THESE PHILOSOPHIES EXIST. TO WASTE TIME.",
