   "message": "Greetings group...I'm new here but have been down the rabbit hole for a while now after an unlawful pat down from the fuzz. I first heard of Scott while following conversations on Deans page. To answer a few questions...I am who I say I am. I come from Adelaide, Australia. I am here because I don't know what I don't know but I am aware of the fraud that is going down and seek to restore my status, expose the crooks and help those I see getting screwed by the system too. My background is in graphic design and motion graphics but since 2006 my main gig is as a video editor for a public broadcaster. I take great pleasure in asking journalists curly questions that they don't like the answers to! Besides that my other interests include spending time in and on the ocean and building and flying radio controlled aircraft. My Value? Priceless.",
