   "message": "When I can see a \"spirit-o-meter\", and you can demonstrate HOW a Spirit-o-meter works, and prove it in controlled tests, and then measure the existence of the \"spirit\" in question, then I will accept that it MIGHT exist.\n\nHere in reality, we can see where in your little lump of meatware, you \"believe in god\". We know EXACTLY WHERE it is, and WHY it's there. WE'VE MAPPED THE HUMAN GENOME!
