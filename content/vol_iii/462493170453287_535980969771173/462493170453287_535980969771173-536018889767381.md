   "message": "Hi! They call me Sommer but I call myself Sunni. I was recommended here by Gail Blackman to learn,  to meet people who can help me become free.  \nCurrently My husband and I are deciding to have a child or not,  keeping the child out of the system is my biggest concern with that.  We each have 2 daughters that we had when we were very young. My husband is not willing to learn this.  He is one who knows something is wrong but hides his head in the sand.  I'm the type who knows somethings wrong and I want to change it.  I want us all to be free. \nI also am about peace and love but don't worry ill get that down the hall ;-)",
