   "message": "is the mechanism by which peoples children, themselves, their labour and everything they work for is taken in some fashion.\nThis is accomplished by,\n1) The great Bank Note, a promise to pay however no date nor with what is stated.\n2) With the above comes interest which is an oxymoron. Interest on a promise to pay?\n3) Interest correlates with inflation (deflation if you want to look at it from the point of view of the value of the note. Or Inflation from the value of the product/service obtained)\n3)a) This is exponential at a specific point.\n4) The mere fact that an amount is created on a promise that was originally created from oneself only to be required to pay with time and labour in the future with interest is tantamount to self induced slavery.\nSlavery in all its forms generally self induced thru ignorance and/or greed - this is money\nMoney is required when we wish to enslave others and/or perpetuate the continuance of it.\nBecause of our ignorance the ones who created this system benefit to a very large exponential rate.\nThe Rivet is *stop using it and it will fall at the speed of light*",
