   "message": "@Scott.\nWho are we, \"Knownas Colin\", a pensioner?\nWe were born at the end of WW2 a man of body, mind and soul/spirit in a fundementally Christian society, Australia. When registered (at a Police Station; as was the requirement at the time), the Birth Registry shows our name(s) to be only a Christian and a Given name, with no family/surname. We were later baptised with a Christian and a given name, but, again, with no family or surname.\nThere is no [official] documentation stating we have a family/surname and neither does it state that we were born and baptised a PERSON (a slave). Indeed, the Birth Certificate, as well, does not show that we have a family/surname. There is no requirement for anyone to have a family/surname, as with many cultures, irrespective of a legislated Parliamentary Statute (Act).\nConsequently, it is our comprehension that we are a man with a Christian and Given name only.\nOf course, this pisses-off the cops when we state, under DURESS, that we have no family/surname ... nevertheless, they then charge us with \"failing to comply with a Police directive\", contrary to section# of Blah Blah Act. However, the Police 'choose' to 'change our name' that includes a 'Family/Surname' and in so doing commit Personage; so much for \"DUE PROCESS\" and their Oath of Office.\nThat said; why are we as a member of this site? Primarily we are here to learn and sometimes we have something to contribute.",
