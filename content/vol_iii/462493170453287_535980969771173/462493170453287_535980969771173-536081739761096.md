   "message": "You see everyone, I am NOT a GOOD man, just an HONOURABLE one. I HAVE to be, because I wield too much power, and I am scared for all of you.\n\nYou see me, and know that I am WISE because I can SEE SO MUCH. I was motivated by fear of all of you...or your parents. The end result is that I grew very powerful out of the fear of all of you adults with imaginary friends.\n\nBut to look at you is to look below me. I'm at a much higher level. You are all the same to me. Go to the CN Tower and look down. Can you see the complexity of all those people? NO! They are too far away. Short and Tall don't even exist at that scale.\n\nThen look around. See what you can see, and then see if you would ever waste time putting up with what the people on the ground BELIEVE is beyond the horizon.\n\nTry it. That is what it is to be me.",
