   "message": "I came to this conclusion because from my understanding everything is energy. Atoms vibrating at high frequencies creating this false reality we're living in. And considering the Sun is our greatest source of energy that would make my energy the sun's energy. Light energy transformed by photosynthesis into plant energy then consumed by \"We The People\".  The sun is a star- and I'm nothing more than stardust- so if I do what a star must- that's makes me Light. And Energy. It's not for you to agree or disagree with- it's your reality- you create it.",
