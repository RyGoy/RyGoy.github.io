   "message": "Really? I haven't seen that here.\n\nLots of adults with imaginary friends pushing lies to explain the lies... I've seen lost of them...but that doesn't really constitute \"greatness\".\n\nWhere is this greatness of which you speak? If you are referring to me... Well I have lofty goals. it suits my purposes to have informed people around. \n\nAny enlightenment you get from here is a byproduct of my larger agenda. Do with it what you will. For everyone that wakes up and follows the \"exit\" signs, there are 1000 who will suffer at my hands. I am COUNTING on the fact that most of you think wrong and value the wrong things. It makes you predictable. That makes for great long-term plans. :D\n\nGreatness doesn't exist here. Greatness will be the RESULT. You're merely impressed by me. You set the bar FAR too low, and you aren't very picky about what's \"acceptable\".",
