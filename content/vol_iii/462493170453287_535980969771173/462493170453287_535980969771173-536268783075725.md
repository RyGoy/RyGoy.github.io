   "message": "I am confused as fuck! This group is great but it is also full of massive posts. I just spent the last hour reading through this 1. I found the Notice of Mistake the other night and saved it, then Derek Moran's post linking the Notice of Mistake and Surety posts last night (thanks for that). Is there a place we can go to get our hands on an accumulated listing of Scotts teachings? I am so keen to learn but am fairly time poor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I live in Adelaide, South Australia and all i know is, i know fuck all. I found this group after following Deans work and seeing Scott post on Deans page. I am here to learn. Thank you.",
