   "message": "Thanks for the welcome Scott. Yes, I am aware that the government here is unlawful. Those of us who are trying to bring this to the attention of others really have our work cut out. Because of our great beaches and the easy women the majority are too distracted to get it or realise the future implications of what they are acquiescing to. I am aware of a few groups here in Aus trying to wake people up....such as peopleofthecommonwealth.blogspotcom.com.au and truth-now.net but at the wake up here seems way behind Canada. I have always known that the Queen was pivotal in the matter as we voted at referendum to remain a Constitutional Monarchy in 99. It appears that you have the solution to the puzzle? I'm playing catch up trying to wrap my brain around trusts / legalese / admiralty so I can make sense of it all.",
