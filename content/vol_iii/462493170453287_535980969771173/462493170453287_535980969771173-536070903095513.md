   "message": "I am in Edmonton, opened a furniture store 2 years ago and spent the last 18 years taking care of 2 kids by myself. I do graphics & website design, mostly for myself now. \n\nI have no regrets, just finding it harder and harder to keep up as (especially the last 8 yrs) the �cost of living� has risen far beyond acceptable. I�m not talking necessarily about food, clothing, etc. I�m talking about utilities, gasoline, taxes, traffic tickets and the like. We are under the thumb to corporations selling the resources of our homeland and FORCING us to pay more and more. I have always lived within my means, never bought a new car (mortgage), don�t purchase $500 purses or shoes... hell, I still wear clothes from when I was 20! (Clothing comes back in style every 10 years you know...)  My kids are most important to me and mine are, apparently never moving out. I am here because I had realized a long time ago that this monetary system is slowly KILLING ME/US. And I don�t (er, didn�t) know why. My father is a brazillionaire and �offered� to lend me $10G when I started this store �at 10% INTEREST? Go away. Enough�s enough. \n\nHe�s like Trump... I got to the part in his book about �shoving whomever is in the way down the ladder while your on the way up�. That was the point where I didn�t see value in what Trump had to say...\n\nI am here for knowledge of this system, what we can do about it and to teach my kids and/or anyone else who is interested. I see the youth more interested, or let�s say open-minded in this endeavour and I know this is going to affect THEM the most. They need this knowledge and I want better for their futures.\n\nI have always worked very hard at anything I�ve set my focus on, self-taught in everything I know so far and definitely know how to get shit done, no matter what. How the hell else did I open a store with nothing?",
