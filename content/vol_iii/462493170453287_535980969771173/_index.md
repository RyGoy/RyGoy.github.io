   "message": "I close the group, and I have more members than ever...\n\nFuck! People are weird!\n\nHow many of you work for the government?\nHow many work for the Law Society?\nHow many are ACTUALLY listening to me?\nHow many of you will wake up?\n\nIf you are a member, or just became one, please speak up. I want to know WHY you are here. I want to know WHO is listening. I want to know what YOU can do, and what your VALUE is.\n\nIf you don't know the answer to that last question, SAY so. It's the best one you can declare: \"I don't know what my value is\" = \"I don't know who I am\". I can fix that. but it will cost you... but it's a bargain. If you don't know who you are, then OTHERS will decide who you are FOR you...and that ALWAYS costs more.\n\nALWAYS.\n\nSo if you are a member, I want to hear about you. You are not a number, or an account, or an ID, of a Username with a postage-stamp sized picture. Be more than that.\n\nWho are you?\nWhere do you come from?\nWhy are you here?\nWHAT DO YOU WANT?\n\nI want to know what I have to work with here.",
