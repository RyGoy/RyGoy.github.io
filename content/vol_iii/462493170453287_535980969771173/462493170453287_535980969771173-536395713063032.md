   "message": "What's becoming more apparent to me is your reference to how thinking like a computer is the right way the computer only takes in the  fact and discards the bullshit. Facts are not open for debate so any debate of them is nothing more than an attempt to rationalize a fact and twist it around our fucked up beliefs to make us feel good. 2+2=4 anything that detracts from that is counter productive to the lesson at hand. I also think i know what the out is but i won't spoil it and understand when looking around why you can be so confident that so few can attain it.",
