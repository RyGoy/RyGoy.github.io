   "message": "I missed this...\nI found this group around the time Dean Clifford was locked up months ago. I want to learn - knowledge is always good. Mostly just want to be left alone and do whatever I feel like doing at any particular moment peacefully without some douche forcing insane \"laws\" at me, particularly ones making outlaws of fucking plants that grow in dirt. Does that make sense? I grow things that are needed by people to live and be happy. That is my value. I am OK doing computer shit too. Peace.",
