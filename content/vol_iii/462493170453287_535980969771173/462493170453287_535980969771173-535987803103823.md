Truth be told though, looking at me from the inside, I don't have much of a choice BUT to \"be me\". :D\n\nThat said Nature+Nurture produces endless variations of the same thing. For everyone like me that you meet, there are 100 who are EXACTLY like me, who are working AGAINST your interests. I've invested a lifetime into finding out why those JUST LIKE ME can lack empathy.\n\nWe all seem to start out with it. Why did mine stay? Where did there's go?\nWhy is it so easy to remove it from those JUST LIKE ME?\n\nThese are the questions I pursue. I'm pondering questions you don't even know need to be asked. ;)",
