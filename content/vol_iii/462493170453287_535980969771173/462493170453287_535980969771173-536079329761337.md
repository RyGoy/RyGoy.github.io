   "message": "My mother was German, my father Hungarian, I was born in Montreal. I have lived in Berlin, Alabama, South Carolina, Calgary, and now in Nova Scotia. Im a stay at home researcher. My old man is from French background and also from Montreal. He had a religious up bringing, I didn't, and we are both atheists, and have brought up our children, when we did have them that way.Almost 2 years ago now, we were busted for a small amount of weed and guns wih the help of our oldest daughter. Our  other two were taken away, and it has been a fight ever since to try and get them back. We have a small hobby farm, we raise and butcher our own meat and do quite a bit of raising our own vegtables. We had absolutely no idea of any of this that is going on, and don't even begin to say that we understand. Everyday we are getting a little closer to knowing and understanding, but there is still a lot to learn. I can say one thing for certainty that reading and listening doesn't even compare to actually doing what is suggested here. I know that I still have a lot to learn, because even having been on this site for a while, I feel like I'm a high school student in an advanced university course.",
