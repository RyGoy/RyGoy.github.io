   "message": "OMG, you are like a child parroting 2 + 2 = 4 and not grasping that MATH and not the \"right answer\" is understanding of what they are saying.\n\nScience isn't BELIEF. It's a RECORD of WHAT WE KNOW.\n\nPhysics 101 isn't a set of \"beliefs\". It DOES, in fact give me sweeping understanding, in the same way my understanding of addition will ALWAYS be superior to the two year-old's \"knowledge\" that 2+2=4!\n\nThat's not being \"arrogant\" or \"closed minded\". That's you just being plain old WRONG.",
