   "message": "I am here to learn where I went wrong, what caused it and how to fix it. I have spent 13 years getting run over by the mother of my first two kids who manipulates the system. The system in turn backs her and punishes only me. That is the why.   As to the who, I don't know yet. I know I am no longer a \"you\" and can only ever be a \"me\". I am from misery or legally known as Missouri in the states. What I want is change. Not the kind that the CEO is dishing out. REAL change. The kind that makes everyone know my why and gives everyone the ability to change the outcome of their own lives without fighting from a situation that they can't win from.",
