I have all the benefits with no liability... figuring that one out as we speak...\n\n   I concur with Gail Blackman, Everything I knew was wrong everything I valued was wrong... I am here to find out what I know I don't know.\n\n   I am the Director and Sole Beneficiary Of A Trust...\n\n   As I am not licensed by the queen ... So that also makes me a Pirate....\n\n\n\n\nI am here to learn and act on that knowledge...\nI find taking action is a great fear remover... as long as it is backed by knowledge that I comprehend.\n\n   I am learning to defend myself.\n\n\n\n\nAnd The Tender For Law seems to be the only valid source of information on LAW that at its roots is simple... but because I understand that I think wrong... It is getting easier.\n\n   Peace and thanks to Admiral Scott Duncan",
