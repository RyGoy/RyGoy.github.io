   "message": "The reason I am here is because this is where I know my new found knowledge of Sui Juris will continue to grow.\n\nI was taught what Sui Juris is and was educated on the fraud & deception that is present in everyone�s daily life when I befriended Rob Johnson here on Facebook.  I bought his book and could not return to what I once thought I knew to be fact about what is actually going on.\n\nI have also watched Dean�s videos, which has further opened my eyes.  I have read countless articles, threads, posts and watched countless videos in an effort to expand my knowledge base on the law and how it operates; how one actively presents theirself expressing this knowledge. \n\nI am learning just how much I actually do not know about what is going on, how we all got into this mess and how some want you to continue to not know.\n\nThe more I learn, the more I want to know.  Ironically, the more I learn, the more pissed I become at the deception continually crafted & projected upon the masses.\n\nI joined this group to further my knowledge.  What I want is to become knowledgeable enough to be able to make a difference in many other lives by being able to help them open their eyes, so they may be able to help others open their eyes.\n\nAs a cute example, I pulled this on my 8 year old nephew this week while on vacation:\n\nI told my nephew that since he�s been on vacation for 6 days now, that he had forgotten how to sign his full name.  He told me that he could still do it.  I folded a piece of paper and said prove it.  He signed it successfully!  He laughed and said, �I told you!�  After he said this, I unfolded the paper and showed him where he had signed and agreed that Uncle Roy was his boss forever, which was written at the top of the paper.  You should have seen the look on his face!  I told him, �Never sign anything that you haven�t read and fully agree too.�\n\nI know he learned something through this because I heard him telling another relative he called later that he had just signed a contract with Uncle Roy.  Before this, he had never heard the word contract.",
