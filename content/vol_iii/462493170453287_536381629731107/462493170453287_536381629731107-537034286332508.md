   "message": "When my Opa was dying my father told him his kids were gonna fight over his shit. He didn't believe my dad. The man only had a car, leather sofa and some dough in an account ($30G). And sure enough they DID!. My parents took care of him for the last years of his life and when he moved in with them he brought a little chandelier which my mom hung in some room. The family wanted EVERYTHING to go to auction INCLUDING that fucking chandelier and my mom refused to take it down. How stupid. Opa was in the Army and they EVEN AUCTIONED HIS UNIFORMS ï¿½OMFG! I told my dad to make sure to buy those back and give them to my cousin who was named after Opa. They auctioned all his black and white personal photographs... everything...",
