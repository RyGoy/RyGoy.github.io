   "message": "I am the executor of the Estate. I had just over $4,000 in my savings account. All that went to my lawyer within about two weeks. I still owe my lawyer over two thousand. My lawyer wrote a few letters, made a few phone calls and informed me the money was gone and that I owed her even more. When I told my lawyer I couldn't pay anymore immediately, their office sent me a bill and wished me luck. I tried to take care of it on my own. I found Robert Menard on youtube and follwed him for a while. Those were long nights trying to learn what I could. That lead me to Dean Clifford stuff on youtube. Anyways, I did my best to administrarte this on my own and wrote a bunch more letters. Then I heard about charging for my time from Dean. I called her lawyers office to say I was going to charge $500 per hour for my time. Since then, they have never responded back to my letters. I guess that means they don't want to contract with me.",
