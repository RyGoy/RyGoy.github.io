   "message": "I wish I could let it go Steve. I haven't slept well since. Really! I feel so violated and angry and hurt. If I could get what I should have coming to me it would completely change my life. I work part time for a little more than minimum wage and can barley  pay my rent or eat. My shit car has broken down and I can't afford to fix it. Soon any value it may have will be gone because a mechanic told me that if I don't get it running in the next few months or sooner the motor could seize, then I'll get $40.00 for the scrap metal. My Dad worked very hard all his life to pass something on to my sister and I. It's like she wiped out the core of his intentions to work hard. It's like she wants to pretend that none of his work was done for me and my sister. It's just so wrong!!!!  I am sooo steaming MAD it's making me crazy. To turn my back on it would be to turn my back on what my father stood and lived for.",
