   "message": "What do you guys think of my strategy to lay criminal charges. As I understand it if I lose I can still go for a civil/administrative remedy. I'm also thinking that way I don't set myself up for losing by way of estoppel. I mean if i study this for 6 months and then start it up again, they might argue that my silence over the months was an indication of my consent. BTW Thank you all so very much for all your input. <3 <3 You guys have helped me more than you know. More than my family even. In fact, they are thinking I am crazy with all this \"\"freeman stuff.",
