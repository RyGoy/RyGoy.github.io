   "message": "I'm still not sure about PROPER NOTICE. I did send \"letters\" with NOTICE TO CEASE AND DESIST, NOTICE OF HARM AND FINANCIAL INJURY, and so on. Not by registered mail and I don't know if they were properly written to be called a PROPER NOTICE. These were ignored. About 30 letters (including NOTICES) were written and sent. Most weren't responded to and about 90% of the responses never addressed my questions or concerns. Most told me to hire a lawyer as it would be prejudicial to my interests if I didn't.",
