   "message": "Just prior to the death of my mother, my step-father and my mother signed the back of a vehicle registration form and gifted me a car as a token of appreciation for all my help. Immediately after the death of my mother, my money crazed EVIL step-brother and step-sister (who hated my son and I because they knew that my son and I were in my \"Dad's\" LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT and were situated to get an equal share of my his Estate) sequestered my father from us by keeping him in their home without allowing my son and I access. Anyways, not a week later I get a call from my \"dad\" and with the prompting voices of the evil children in the background, my \"dad\" asks me for the car back, and, with much stress in his voice he informs me that he has changed his mind, and, has now decided he doesn't want to gift me the car. He now wants it back. Pissed, and realizing what was going on (he's a self professed victim of elder abuse at their hands) I reminded him that he has already gifted the car to me. After more prompting by the evil kids in the background, he tells me meekly that if I don't deliver the car by 8pm he would call the police. Fast forward to today...I have the car and \"can't\" get it registered in \"my\" NAME because: a) Service Ontario requires that my declaration that the car was gifted be verified by my step-father attendance wherein he must SWEAR or AFFIRM that he gifted the car in the presence of a Notary. The only other option provided by SERVICE ONTARIO is that I COMMIT FRAUD and claim I purchased the car, inform them of the amount I paid, and pay tax on that amount (this would obviously potentially cause injury to my \"dad\", as I'm sure that the CRA would be expecting him to declare the extra income on his tax return).  So, I am driving a car that is mine, which I cannot register unless I commit fraud. The tags on the plates have expired which I can't renew. Even though I have paid for insurance in \"my\" NAME, it is my understanding that the insurance provided is invalid because it must be in the name of the registered owner (they claim otherwise - the do highlight the fact that any potential claims that would normally be paid out to me would be paid out to my \"dad\"). The point of the story is: due to my unwillingness to commit FRAUD, I inadvertently find myself following in the tracks of Dean Clifford. I still have my drivers license though, and, if you'll recall from another post, it's signed Director for: followed by my signature.",
