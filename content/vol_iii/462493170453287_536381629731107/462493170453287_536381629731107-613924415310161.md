   "message": "Administratively, I did as far as they are concerned. I sent several more letters that weren't responded to. Then I stopped sending letters. Then I went to the police. I had a few officers over, on different occassions over the past few months hoping that a new officer would take my side. That never happened. Then I called their Seargents or whatever and asked to get service. That's been an on and off thing as they work weird shifts, are off for days, or on \"assignments\". Finally I was told by a supervisor cop to lay charges with a JP if I didn't like the way the police were treating this. Anyways it's been months since I wrote to her lawyer as I was thinking of laying charges and have been putting those documents together.",
