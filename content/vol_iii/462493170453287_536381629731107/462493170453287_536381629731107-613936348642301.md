   "message": "Their lawyer's position is that the will (TRUST) isn't worth the paper it's written on as \"survivor-ship rights\" take precedence. In other words anyone who is married and makes a will has wasted their time and money and are fools because their WILL and WISHES do not matter at all. The trust is worthless/of absolutely no effect, and is superseded by statute law.",
