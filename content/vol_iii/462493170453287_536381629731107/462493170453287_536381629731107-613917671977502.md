   "message": "Haven't gone to court because I don't think I know enough about their cluhouse rules to win. That's why I was thinking of going to a JP and laying a criminal complaint. My thinking is that I will lay a charge first for stealing my property. If her lawyer was to mention that there are other matters involved, I would say yes and that I am going to be laying several more criminal charges and that those charges will be filed soon as well. My thinking is/was that once my step mom realized she may face jail time, she would likely change her tune.",
