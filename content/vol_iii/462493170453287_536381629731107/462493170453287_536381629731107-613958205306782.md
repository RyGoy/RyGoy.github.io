   "message": "I contacted a bank I know they had accounts together in and provided them the will. They quoted survivorship rights as well. They also sent me a document (regarding just one of their accounts) my dad signed years ago that said in the case opf his death, he left the balance of the account to her. I haven't written them back but I was thinking that the will was the last instruction he gave and would nullify that older agreement as it was his last will/instruction. Any thoughts on this? It was an American currency account if I remember correctly with about $40,000.00. Should I write back and say give me the money, the last will supercedes any previous wishes/instructions?",
