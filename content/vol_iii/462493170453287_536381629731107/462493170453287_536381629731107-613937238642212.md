   "message": "Yes i have. As an example, i have Aunt/Uncle who had 3 kids. One died at an early age. As i interpreted it, even if the child who passed away is still in their Will, the \"Survivorship-Rights/Rights-of-Survivorship\" would say, the assets would be DISTRIBUTED between the last 2 remaining kids.\n\nAnyone left as Beneficiaries in your dad's Will pass away?",
