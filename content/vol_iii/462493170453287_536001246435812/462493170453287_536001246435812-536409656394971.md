   "message": "It was Tara's response to someone who had mistakenly tried to form hostile intent against her. She did a Mock-Up of National Geographic, and wrote a FEATURE ARTICLE on the \"Preening North American Cam Slut\" (Duplicitus Sluttus). That's because National Geographic has a sense of humour. The Canadian Wildlife Fund threatened to sue us for the \"Hinterland Who's Who\" spot we were making...\n\nParties quickly resolved all disputes, lest Tara put REAL effort into the blow-back. :D Good Times. :D",
