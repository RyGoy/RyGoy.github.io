   "message": "I was at KOOCANUSA in southern B.C. about 30 min south of Fernie. I had a tripod set up in a boat and was doing time-lapse while cruising the lake just after the floods... It goes into Montana and supplies the U.S. with fresh water.\nhuge lake that was the result of a dam built in 1972 down in the states, they drain it every February.\n\nI was working on a promo for a houseboat company.... so I was buzzing houseboats that were doing houseboat things.... \n\nI noticed a houseboat that was cruising the lake with a flotation device that you tow behind a speedboat for about 3 people upside down on the speed boat being towed hiding all identification marks...\n\n   I stopped to re frame and adjust the composition of the shot.... About 300 meters from said houseboat. When a large fellow  in long pants and a khaki shirt who appeared out the doorway... It was 37 C,\nevery other houseboat were doing vacation things, all were dressed for hot weather, swimming, sunbathing, etc.\n\nHe pulled out this HUGE pair of binoculars and surveilled me,  obviously from some para-military organization... I smiled and waved he just turned and went into this fully shuttered houseboat....\n\nI didn't realize I had crossed into the U.S..... but they were obviously law enforcement of some sort..\n   it just struck me as odd, my spidy senses were tingling and I got the fuck out of there.... Just weirdness.\n\nPrey upon the young standard M. O.     Fuckers",
