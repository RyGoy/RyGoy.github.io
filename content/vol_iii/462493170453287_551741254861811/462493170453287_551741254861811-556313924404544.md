Josephson, 153 Fed.2d 372,276 (1946).\n\n2. �When the plaintiff has shown that he was arrested, imprisoned or restrained of his liberty by the defendant, \"the law presumes it to be unlawful.� People v.

Thomas, 24 Wendell's Rep. (N.Y.) 418, 419 (1840).\n\n5. �It is doubtless the duty of an officer who executes a warrant of arrest to state the nature and substance of the process which gives him the authority he professes to exercise, and, if it is demanded, to exhibit his warrant, that the party arrested may have no excuse for resistance.� Shovlon v.
