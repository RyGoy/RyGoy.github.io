   "message": "My mom taught me NOT to talk to strangers. :)\n\nI have observed that one of the most important parts of the programming we, the non-nobles, get is to feel obligated to ANSWER to ANY QUESTIONS asked by others, even by COMPLETE STRANGERS (like cops, and figures of \"authority\").  \n\nWe were trained to feel GUILT if we don't answer questions. Trained to \"believe\" something \"bad\" will happen if we don't \"cooperate.\"  Just like a disobedient child is trained to feel, when not answering to his father's questions, and/or obey his demands/commands.\n\nWe are trained to either comply, and/or start \"yapping-away,\" somehow acknowledging/giving presumption of authority. \n\nWhat is the the \"best\" way to respond to such encounter with police...? What the heck do I know? That would be a GREAT thread, Scott. I'm just sayin'. \n\nI have heard of the \"Am I being detained? Am I free to go?\" mantra. But if everything is about surety, and accounting (which involves contracts), there has to be a key to all this. I have learned that questions negate understanding, and that seems to be part of it, but I see SILENCE as an underestimated component. But again, what the heck do I know?",
