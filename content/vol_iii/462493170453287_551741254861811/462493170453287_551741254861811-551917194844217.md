   "message": "When the uneducated psychopath with the gun, nightstick  & bad attitude comes a knocking on my door, I will probably say whatever is required to get the scary man away from me...\n\nThese people are like the bank tellers not understanding bills of exchange, because they're not being paid to know, just to 'follow orders'...\n\nGet rid of them & correct any shitstains/mistakes using administrative process and/or notice of mistake and/or the VOID stamp to negate any contracts that I may have entered into without full disclosure.\n\nEven if I am right and honourable and correct in my physical interactions with the scary person/people, I (or the people I love & care about) can still come away from the interaction physically harmed and or killed.  The risk/reward is too in favour of risk.\n\nDo what it takes to get rid of them, fix up any false contracts later...and live peacefully.",
