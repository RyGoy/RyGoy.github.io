   "message": "State courts, pursuant to federal law, have no jurisdiction to hear constitutional claims, or claims against state government or agents of state government, acting in their private capacity outside the requirements and restrictions of law, so if you file a counter claim, of any kind, they pretty much snicker at your ignorance. Trust me, this is first hand knowledge, trial by error and LEGAL practice. Your counter complaint, ideally, is for a federal deprivation of rights or violation of federal law by the state, or state officer, WITH, and this is important, stated up front, like in the Heading, a \"Counter complaint with PETITION FOR REMOVAL to federal district court exercising original jurisdiction over such claims,\" as such claims cannot be heard by the state, against the state, or an agent thereof, and you waive the right youve claimed to access a higher authority by not stating the jurisdiction of your claim, as any claim is required to provide its basis in jurisdiction of law. Dont be a hypocrite yo! Got the devil by his the tail covered in scales, Bro. Im practicing, and giving legal advice, with no licence, foot loose and fancy free. \"It all depends on what your definition of 'is,' Is.\" - Bill Clinton",
