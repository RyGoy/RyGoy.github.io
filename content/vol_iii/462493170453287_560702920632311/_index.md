Mngt waited an hour to approach me, didn't get out on the sidewalk, still in the store, security flashed a badge, led me to a small room, forced me to sign trespass papers which I signed under duress, coercion,with all rights reserved etc, My question is, I want to do an Affidavit/notary witness procedure, where do I find what to charge them with?? USC Codes? UCC codes etc! Any input is appriaceted!!!",
