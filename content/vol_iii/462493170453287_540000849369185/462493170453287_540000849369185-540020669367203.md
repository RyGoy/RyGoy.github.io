   "message": "my understanding is the office (minister for ------) creates a dept who franchise out the obligation, its pointless arguing with the service provider because they owe you no obligation that isn't legislated for(they're answerable to the office through terms of contract), maybe try aiming her problems with the service provider at the relevant minister... the office has binding obligations in order to substantiate its existence, if she's gonna contract, look for better terms? think of it like *agent \"OF\" V's agent \"FOR\". i've done this to help friends in the past. if they \"organise a meeting on her behalf\", instruct THEM to attend & inform her of the outcome, dont allow whoever she pinpoints to escape their obligation once you've determined it.IF She's trying to rare their property ...surely she has a fiduciary duty to attain the best possible care?? :p",
