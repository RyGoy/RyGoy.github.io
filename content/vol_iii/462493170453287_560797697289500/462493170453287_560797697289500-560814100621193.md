In the Supreme Court of New South Wales very recently at end of 2011, in the matter of RUMBELv LIVERPOOL PLAINS COUCIL and ORS, the CEO of the council faced 58 charges of stealingand 1 case of breaking and entering with intent to steal. The Council Ranger faced multiplecharges as did the council; environmental officer. Two members of the NSW police FORCE face102 charges each and one of them is facing 30 years in jail. Two private tow truck operators face58 charges each, 29 counts of stealing and 29 counts of failing to follow the lawful procedure for moving vehicles on the road.This all stems from the council making a purposeful decision to breach the law. RUMBEL had 58second hand cars on his property on the edge of the town of \nQuirindi\n, NSW. On the day inquestion the CEO and his band of thieves turned up, cut the chains locking the gate and enteredand stole 58 vehicles. Luckily for RUMBEL he knew his Common Law well and engaged a QueensCounsel from London. The matter played out on the Supreme Court of NSW where the first 5 judges said they worked for the �corporation� known as New South Wales and the 6\nth\nsaid sheworked for \nThe People\n. The QC removed the first 5 judges as they were, as he put it, �a nothing�.The result has been pleasing for \nThe People\nand the CEO was ordered to transfer all LIVERPOOLPLAINS COUNCIL assets to the NSW State Government and the rest of the defendants were welladvised to get their affairs in order as they would be responsible for paying the tens of millions of dollars in compensation, and none of the compensation would come froe the rate payers of thatcouncil.The matter was then uplifted by the judge to the High Court of Australia for confirmation of thecompensation to be paid and that will be heard on the 21\nst\nMay 2012.The QC concerned is a world authority on trespass and demonstrated to the Supreme Court of NSW that for some decades no legislation in the Commonwealth of Australia has received\nRoyal Assent \nand is therefore invalid and inoperative. The private lawyer from Lismore engaged by theLIVERPOOL PLAINS COUNCIL, at one stage rose to claim he had a copy of the NSW LocalGovernment ACT 1993 and the QC advised that it had not received Royal Accent and wasworthless. He apparently tore it in half and dropped it. Apparently the Judge aggress with the worldauthority on trespass.Leonard Clampett visited the crime scene last week and took careful note that all 58 vehicles areback on the RUMBEL�S property and there are about 15 more parked on the footpath outside. Thismatter is as yet not mentioned in law reports and will probably remain so, lest Percy Public getwind of it. However, through your own corrupt department of justice, you should be able to get atranscript for your defence from the corrupt judicial system in New South Wales with little trouble. Itwill be soon spread far and wide across the internet for all to see what corrupt mongrels we haveworking FOR us.Put THEM on full notice of the coming action against them for their failure to comply with lawfullegislation and attempting to impose invalid legislation upon myself. Ignorance of the Law is NOExcuse.",
