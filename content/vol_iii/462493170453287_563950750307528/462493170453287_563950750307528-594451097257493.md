   "message": "There is only one \"small\" problem. Unfortunately in REALITY, we do not own the NAME. Using a NAME that is not OURS is FRAUD. \n\nThat is why Scott says he created ANOTHER PERSON (which could be a corporation) to  be able to act in commerce for the man (a proxy), is something you created, therefore you CONTROL, while you avoid FRAUD, and have \"limited liability\" for the actions of the new PERSON.\n\nSo, the best position to administrate  from, would be a position in which you control everything, but owe nothing, while reducing liability to almost none.",
