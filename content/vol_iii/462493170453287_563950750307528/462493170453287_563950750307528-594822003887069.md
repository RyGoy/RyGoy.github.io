   "message": "ah, just to note, i saw somewhere (in law) that the mere act of keeping a ledger, even if it were a scrap of paper and not a pretty notebook, the ledger in and of itself is proof of a party performing banking, and they are liable for collecting taxes on sales. i have also heard through the movies that cops are trained to recognize such a thing if/when performing a search of a premesis for any evidence. the ledger for bitcoin is public without any names attached UNLESS one admits to a knowledge of such thing existing.",
