   "message": "Does the govt not just have legal title ownership...which is 1/10 ownership? ..is it that when you lien the legal name, your \"rights\" cease as well, which means they aren't really being negatively effected...it all balances out the ledger?\n\ntitle. (15c) 1. lhe union of all elements (as ownership,\npossession, and custody) constituting the legal right to\ncontrol and dispose of property; the legal link between\na person who owns property and the property itself\n<no one has title to that land>. Cf. OWNERSHIP; posSESSION.\n2. Legal evidence of a person's ownership\nrights in property; an instrument (such as a deed) that\nconstitutes such evidence <record your title with the\ncounty clerk>.\n\"Though employed in various ways, [title] is generally\nused to describe either the manner in which a right to real\nproperty is acquired, or the right itself. In the first sense, it\nrefers to the conditions necessary to acquire a valid claim\nto land; in the second, it refers to the legal consequences\nof such conditions. These two senses are not only interrelated,\nbut inseparable: given the requisite conditions, the\nlegal consequences or rights follow as of course; given the\nrights, conditions necessary for the creation of those rights\nmust have been satisfied. Thus, when the word 'title' is\nused in one sense, the other sense is necessarily implied.\"\nKent McNeil, Common Law Aboriginal Title 10 (1989).",
