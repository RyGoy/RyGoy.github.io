   "message": "In the booklet \"Trustees in Commerce, By Carlton Weiss\" it says that its fraud to lien a trust you did not create, and annexed are the reasons suggested. \n\nIn the USA, if a corporation liens a NAME that did not created, to be HELD in TRUST, would this be fraud? If not, what Am I missing? Scott Duncan? I am trying to protect my property and persons, by applying what I have learned here.\n\n<<A UCC Financing Statement (UCC-1) is a very mighty financial instrument indeed, but only when used for the right situation. Filing a lien on a trust you did not create and did not act as trustee for is inherently fraudulent because you�re demanding a debt from an entity that owes you nothing. If the US government decided to issue you a social security account number and thereby create a revocable living trust naming you the beneficiary, you have no grounds to file a lien on that trust. No commercial gain was had at your expense, even if the trust is identified based on the name of the cestui qui trust, such as using your name in all capital letters (e.g., JOHN WAYNE DOE).\n\n... Therefore, one who is a beneficiary, one who benefits from a trust created by the US government has no recourse to file a lien when he discovers he�s been made the beneficiary of a trust identified based on his name.>> Trustees in Commerce\nBy Carlton Weiss",
