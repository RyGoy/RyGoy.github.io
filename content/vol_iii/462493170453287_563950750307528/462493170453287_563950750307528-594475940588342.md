   "message": "Maybe in your charter, put one of the roles of the corporation as 'currency exchange'...whenever I hace registered a corp in Australia or UK, you need to put primary business eg: healthcare...you can also amend the list at any time...have it written in the minutes of a company meeting as to the change in policy & proceed from there.\n\nRe passports & drivers licences etc:  once the 'person' is liened into the private trust held by the corp, the drivers licence & passport etc become trust property.\n\nWrite into the trust charter that the trustee of the private trust has exclusive use of trust property (part of your compensation plan fro agreeing to act as trustee)...you are now exclusively entitled to use that trust property, but you also have evidence to demonstrate that it is trust property you are using...demonstrating that you are using the person, but are not the person...",
