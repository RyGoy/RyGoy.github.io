You can TRAVEL without a passport, using YOUR OWN boat, or YOUR OWN plane, with your OWN private runway. You don't need \"licenses\" or \"permits\", but WE certainly need what we have been stripped off, and that is HUGE BALLS to take care of our own, and do things ourselves.\n\nSame thing with money. We can have our own RIGHT NOW, but it takes some HUGE BALLS to do it. And we have been programmed with tons of excuses WHY we can't/won't do it.\n\nGovernment is a freaking service, nothing else. They have guns, then you get own guns. They have laws,; hell you have your own Laws. They have \"money\", hell you have YOUR OWN.\n\nI still don't have THE BALLS to completely do without government services. But hell I KNOW now what the fuck to do to get away from that shit, and that is growing some fucking balls!\n\nWho is with me?",
