You then ORDER (from the corporation, for which you are the CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER) to LIEN your BIRTH CERTIFICATE. The corporation can then hold that asset IN TRUST\n\nTo establish a trust, write it down, and have it witnessed and notarized. The end. Only shareholders of your corporation are recognized by the trust.",
