   "message": "Without \"ME\", there is no PERSON, I am the SUPPLIER, and should be first in line to get paid.....period. No Supplier = No business...that seems way more powerful than the equity to me, of course I may NOT grasp this equity thing at this moment, but to claim equity, a profit needs to be made.....as a SUPPLIER, I care less about the profit, I get paid, and the person's book can be negative or positive, what do I care ?....sorry if I stain shit this thread....",
