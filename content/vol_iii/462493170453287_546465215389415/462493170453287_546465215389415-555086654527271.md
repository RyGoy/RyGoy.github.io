The court may find that it is a constructive trust, if the property owner is unjustly enriched, and the contributor receives no benefit. The effect of a constructive trust, is that the owner of the property, may have to hold the property, in trust for the contributor. \n\nhttp://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/glossary/?id=448",
