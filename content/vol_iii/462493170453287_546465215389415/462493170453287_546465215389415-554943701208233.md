   "message": "Derek Moran regarding a comment you made above. My B.C.  on the back states, \"this certificate\" Blacks law 9th definition of this certificate is 'see stock certificate'.\nI do not know how others see this but to me the B.C. is simply a promissory note  showing that I am the creditor and the issuer is the debtor. Though having no cash out value any debt I create I should be able to set off and discharge against the debt of the B.C.",
