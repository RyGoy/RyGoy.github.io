Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof.....\n\nSee whats missing in the CHARTER version?..... i was leafing through my Donovan Waters' 'Law of Trusts' book last night, and what it mentioned; one of the accepted RIGHTS of the Beneficiary in Trust Law, is?...that they are to have the- 'ENJOYMENT OF PROPERTY'\n\n..im guessing there's a reason why they conveniently left THAT out, hmm? ;)",
