   "message": "Sorry if off topic but while I have been writing documents for the last 3 weeks for analysis and structure as to the goal of each I found out the difference of using the \"and/or\", or the, \"and & or\" mentioned in another post by Scott Duncan. While following the structure of a question/statement using slips of paper as the people/organizations referred to I realized the significance of the differences between the two and how either affects the question/statement. Just thought I would point out the importance of the two as to comprehend they completely change what you are asking or stating. Back to practice for me.",
