   "message": "The inference that two or more things that are similar to each other in some respects are also similar in other respects.\n\nAn analogy denotes that similarity exists in some characteristics of things that are otherwise not alike.\n\nIn a legal argument, an analogy may be used when there is no precedent (prior case law close in facts and legal principles) in point. Reasoning by analogy involves referring to a case that concerns unrelated subject matter but is governed by the same general principles and applying those principles to the case at hand.",
