   "message": "Scott on how we were registered as a NEGOTIABLE SECURITY INTEREST- thread....\n\nScott Duncan: OK time to shut up, monique. That is not true. They do not register you as a \"Corporation\". Who are the shareholders? Who are the directors?\n\nYou are registered as a NEGOTIABLE SECURITY INTEREST, nothing more.\n\nStop saying they register you as a \"corporation\" because it's NOT TRUE.\n\nMonique Moon: your all capitol letter name is your corporate person...\n\nScott Duncan: NO, it is NOT. It doesn't matter what your \"gurus\" say, it's not true.\n\nIt is a SECURITY INTEREST. NOTHING MORE.\n\nSECURITY INTEREST: A property interest created by agreement or by operation of law to secure performance of an obligation (esp. repayment of a debt) .ï¿½ Although\nthe UCC limits the creation of a security interest to PERSONAL PROPERTY (ahem), the Bankruptcy Code defines the term to mean- \"a LIEN created by an agreement.\" Black's Law 9th.\n\nSECURITY INTEREST: interest in real property or personal property, that secures the payment of an obligation. In common law, security interests are either consensual (by agreement), or arise by OPERATION OF LAW, as in the case of judgment LIENS and statutory LIENS. Barron's Dictionary of Business Terms 4th-edition.\n\nMonique Moon: your the security interest...\n\nits all under their commerce admiralty/maritime laws.....its all based on contracts...\n\nthey cannot interface with u unless u agree to it...\n\nwe are the security...again our labor our efforts our words our energy...\n\nScott Duncan Which you know NOTHING about, CLEARLY.\n\nThen shut up and read. You are saying things that are NOT TRUE. This is your LAST warning.\n\nSECURITY: Components of a security are: (1) an investment of money. (2) in a common enterprise. (3) with an expectation of profits SOLELY from the EFFORTS OF OTHERS\n\nFinance SECURITY: COLLATERAL offered by a debtor to a lender to secure a loan, called COLLATERAL SECURITY.\n\nINVESTMENT Security: an INSTRUMENT that signifies an ownership position in a corporation (a STOCK), a CREDITOR relationship with a corporation or GOVERNMENTAL BODY (a BOND), or other ownership rights.\n\nSECURITIES > BOND: essentially, a loan agreement representing a debt. In return for the capital given to a corporation or a government entity, the bondholder gets a promise of repayment of principal and interest over time, instead of ownership rights. Since the holder of a bond is a creditor instead of an owner, his claims against the assets of a corporation are satisfied first in case of a failure of the business venture. Most bonds are secured by some kind of COLLATERAL(that would be US), so that in case of default, the debt might still be satisfied. Consequently, bonds are generally a lower risk investment. Bonds raise money commonly known as Debt Capital.\n\nBOND: any INTEREST-bearing or discounted government or corporate security that OBLIGATES the ISSUER to PAY the BONDHOLDER a specified sum of money, usually at specific intervals, and to repay the principal amount of the loan at maturity. Bondholders have an IOU from the ISSUER, but no corporate ownership privileges, as stockholders do. Barron's Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms 3rd-edition.\n\nBEARER BONDS: an owner of Bearer Bonds presents the bond-COUPONS and is PAID INTEREST. Bearer Bonds are NEGOTIABLE instruments that must be safeguarded by the owner to prevent loss. Interest is paid by coupon redemptions. SEE security bond, treasury bond.\n\nREGISTERED BONDS: the owner of Registered Bonds appears on the records of the Bond ISSUER.\n\nSECURED BOND: is backed by COLLATERAL which may be sold the bondholder to satisfy a claim if the bond's issuer fails to pay interest and principal when they are due.\n\nUNSECURED BOND or DEBENTURE: is backed by the full-faith-and-credit of the issuer, but NOT by any specific collateral.\n\nCONVERTIBLE BOND: gives its owner the privilege of exchange for OTHER securities of the issuing company at some future date and under prescribed conditions.\n\nA BOND in FINANCE, is the obligation of one person to repay a debt taken on by SOMEONE ELSE, should that other person default. A bond can also be MONEY or securities deposited as a pledge of good faith.\n\nSURETY or PERFORMANCE BOND: an agreement whereby an insurance company becomes liable for the performance of work or services provided by a contractor by an agreed-upon date. If the contractor does not do what was promised, the surety company is financially responsible. See also INDENTURE; ZERO COUPON SECURITY.\n\n ..so who gets paid the INTEREST-COUPON-REDEMPTIONS?\n\nDerek Moran: AMERICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPT(think REVENUE RECEIPT): a receipt issued by American banks to domestic buyers as a convenient substitute for direct ownership of stock in FOREIGN(CROWN Corporation of BRITAIN) companies. ADRs are traded on stock exchanges(i think CANADA is trade on the Luxembourg stock-exchange) and in over-the-counter markets like stocks of domestic companies. Stock dividends and similar adjustments to the underlying shares are paid in cash or ADR dividends by the BANK(OF CANADA?)\n\nDerek Moran: Scott.. CANADA the CORPORATIONS shares are traded on the stock-exchange of LUXEMBOURG, if i am not mistaken?\n\nScott Duncan: They are.\n\nScott Duncan: People need to know what a CORPORATION is.\n\nA CORPORATION MUST HAVE:\n\nA FIRST DIRECTOR\nSHAREHOLDERS\nGOVERNMENT ENDORSEMENT\nAnd a RECEIVING TRUSTEE (Bank)\n\nYou AND your Birth Certificate are NOT THESE THINGS.\n\nIt's closer to a $20.00 Bill than it is to a \"Corporation\".\n\nEVERYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS LYING TO YOU.\n\nWeLove JessicaDawn AndOthers: CHARLES MORELAND (negotiable security interest) -->>PERSON.\n\nPete Daoust: CHARLES MORELAND seems to me as an account....not a corporation....this is an account with surety attached to it...\n\nand YOU (whatever the name YOU want to use...I use MASTER) are the LAWFUL HOLDER OF THIS CHARLES MORELAND account\n\nYou are the SOLE beneficiary of the account\n\nyou just have to wait until someone is fucking around with the SURETY\n\nI'm pierre or peter or pete or Babe or Dad, and I'm the LAWFUL HOLDER IN DUE COURSE of this account that his creators named PIERRE DAOUST\n\nI'm the sole beneficiary of this account\n\nI'm the MASTER of this account...and it seems to me that someone is messing around with the account's surety",
