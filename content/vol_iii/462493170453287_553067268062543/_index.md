   "message": "I am respectfully requesting (see what I did there?) Admiral Scott Duncan to explain/share, if it is his wish (see what I did there?),: how must one deal with a \"police\" encounter\" outside of the courtroom? How to deal with \"thugs-with-guns\" at our door step? How to deal with \"thugs-with-guns\" when they turn their lights on us (without having committed any crime), while on the road? How to deal with \"thugs-with-guns\" knocking at our vehicle windows? What to do when asked for \"ID\"? \n\nI, myself, have watched many videos of \"success\" at border patrol checkpoints, DUI checkpoints, open carry situations, and very few at people's doorsteps. Some have similarities, but none are the same. Apparently, it also depends in the level of \"experience\" these \"public officials\" have dealing with \"difficult\" \"persons\". \n\nMany other videos I've seen are made by \"attorneys\". All they say is: \"I don't consent to searches,\" \"I'm not gonna talk, unless in front of my lawyer.\" \"Never, under any circumstances talk to cops, not without a lawyer.\" All those answers that still pin surety on us. \n\nI have also watched other attempts to deal with police, which not only are unnecessarily confrontational, but plain DUMB. You've seen what happens to those. \n\nWhat is the key to all this? If it's all about surety, and accounting (involving contract), how must one deal when dealing with a police encounter? Thanks!",
