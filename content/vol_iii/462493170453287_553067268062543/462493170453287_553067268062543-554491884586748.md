   "message": "Robert Cormier, Yes like your comment. I am finding that I LOVE talking to cops until they get so uncomfortable they run or stomp back to their cars. I got arrested this July and charged with \"obstruction\" . when He read me my rights I told him \"I know my rights, now let me read you yours...He stomped away yelling at me \"ARE YOU DONE YET....ARE YOUU DONE YETTT. I Said \"NO\". The charges never got filed....But some disclosures arrived today...and yes I plan to make good on that \"anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a court of law... Now with that said the silent part is also being used againt people....You must object, rebut loudly. They now are saying ohh oh you don't have to sign that...(because the last time had 4 corners rule, under protest, all rights reserved).If you know who you are I think it will go further than just doing everything right, because they are changing  and bending the rules and most of the cops don't even know. I try to speak to these Policy enforcers with words they would hear from a judge or a superior officer, such as are you now \"fabricating evidance\", \"you are out of uniform\"....I try to turn everything back on them until they finnaly realize how stupid they sound...",
