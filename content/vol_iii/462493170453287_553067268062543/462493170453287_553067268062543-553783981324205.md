   "message": "Warning! The following link is from a lawyer. I came across it years ago and it seemed to make so much sense at the time when I first began \"my search for freedom\". Now, I'm not so sure, as I'm starting to get that silence equals consent. Yet some confusion remains. For example, as inferred above, if I am the master of my own affairs, must I answer to men/women who identify themselves as fictitious persons? In this link, at 8:23 the lawyer suggests that you only speak to police if they consent to granting you immunity, to which he immediately advises that the police will never grant you immunity from what you say, so that option is pie in the sky. From there he goes on to provide the \"top ten\" reasons you should never speak to police. Many of the points he raises (even though he is a lawyer) still make sense to me generally. at the very least this video provides insight how justices, police and prosecutors/lawyers think and scheme to nail you to their cross. Perhaps silence is a good idea for an absolute newbie. As for me, should I find myself confronted by a fiction, being controlled by a man or woman with a gun, I am determined and prepared to keep repeating \"Am I free to go? and \"am I being detained?\" until such time as I am allowed to go about my business, or, placed under arrest. I may also hand out a card similar to the one postcard created by Beverly Girl-Brain Braaksma. Anyways, I too am really enjoying this thread. Thanks Maximiliano Pï¿½rez. Input on this welcome as always. :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc",
