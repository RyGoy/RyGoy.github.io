   "message": "Point 2 - I think it's safe to assume that cops are dealing with crime until we determine otherwise. Then we choose our words carefully as court is in session. Plus we don't know they are out to harm us...\n\nPoint 3 - Only when we wish to contract and fully understand the terms & conditions of doing so\n\nPonts 4 - Cops aren't gonna wallop you as soon as you converse with them... Giving them the time of day isn't ceding jurisdiction... If they attempt to engage you there having been no crime then it's question time for them...\n\nPoint 5 - (See point 4) :)\n\nThe Guards (Cops) here in Ireland are unarmed gun wise so the element of threat is somewhat less than that in America and Canada etc... Ignorance is plentiful, no need for weapons... :(",
