   "message": "If I encounter the \"law\" on the road again I will quickly ascertain whether or not there has been a crime of which they are investigating and need my assistance, or if they suspect me of a crime. If not then I would tell them that I do not understand the nature of their stopping me. I think it was Dean Clifford who said court starts at the side of the road...\n\nNothing you say will stop them from doing what they believe they have the authority to do... Statutes are the law of the land to these people. In training I'd imagine they too are lied to through omission... \n\nI was arrested over a yr ago and was before a court within 2 hrs... The arresting guard was speaking with the sergeant explaining that I was totally un-cooperative, not answering any questions etc. The sergeant said something to him then and he became quite annoyed restating how un-cooperative I had been. In my opinion the sergeant knew they had nothing and it pissed the guard off... I folded however not having near enough knowledge or balls to stand my ground...",
