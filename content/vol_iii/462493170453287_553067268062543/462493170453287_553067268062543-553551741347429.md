   "message": "I have many questions concerning this particular matter. \n1- Is remaining silent AT ALL TIMES, regardless of who asks the questions, any crime? What's \"the charge\"?\n2- If \"government\" is a fiction, if they are De Facto \"governments\", if cops are complete STRANGERS, and I haven't sworn an Oath: would it not be DELUSIONAL to stop, and/or talk to \"fictions\" and/or complete strangers that WE KNOW are out to HARM us?\n3- If we know WE are NOT the name, why would we respond/act on behalf of it?\n4- Wouldn't just talking to a cop presume authority already? If \"laws/statues\" don't apply to ME, then what am I doing talking to a cop, even if it is to ask questions?\n5- If there is no authority of a man over another man, unless by consent and/or voodoo doodoo, why even acknowledge their presence when \"speaking\"?\n\nWhat the heck do I know? But, there has to be a key to all this.\n\nI know REALITY is that there is people with guns out there with a license to kill, if one is not \"obedient,\" regardless of what we \"believe\" and/or think.\n\nI really wish Scott would shed some light on <<If it's all about surety, and accounting (involving contract), how must one deal when dealing with a police encounter?>>",
