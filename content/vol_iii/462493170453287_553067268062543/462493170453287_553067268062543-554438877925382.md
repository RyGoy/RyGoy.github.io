   "message": "Some people have mentioned this before and I think that the way Dean Clifford puts it is a good way of telling them, instead of asking shit of Cops or anyone.\n\"Do you have a Claim against me?,� should be all that you have to repeat to any question that they ask if they ever come for you or stop you. They may still take you, but stick with the question of a Bona fide Claim against you. If they have not witness any breach of Peace, or suspect you of intending to, or of having committing an indictable offense, you have no business with them. No Writ, No Claim, No Warrant. Remember, they are talking to the man now, trying to get him to be surety. Cop: \"What is your name?\" Me: \"Do you have a claim against me?\" Cop: �What is your name?� Me: �Look, you either produce a claim against me or I�m leaving right now.� AND LEAVE!  [�or release me right now,� if arrested.] \nWhat ever you decide to use, STICK TO IT.  Cop: \"You will be taken before a judge in the morning.\" Me: \"Does he have a claim against me?\"",
