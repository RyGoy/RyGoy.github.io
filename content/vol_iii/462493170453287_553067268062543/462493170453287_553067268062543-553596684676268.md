   "message": "This is great!  I have been thinking about this too Max.  I am thinking about the next time I get pulled over.....I want to give them a short document through a slightly opened window (doors locked) with who I am, what capacity I am operating in, and my fee schedule.  Then I think I will keep my hands on the wheel and shut up.  Pete may suggest to me keeping my hands in my pocket.  Either they break in and rip me out, or I travel off.  I am not sure how it will end up, but I will never have identified myself to them as a person in their jurisdiction.",
