   "message": "I have some more questions. No doubt that the \"Am I being detained? Am I free to go?\" mantra has seem to work in many occasions, apparently. \n\nBut, 1- does not the questions \"Am I being detained? Am I free to go?\" already imply/presumes authority, master/servant?  \n2- If \"they\" really don't have ANY authority, why ask those questions? \n3- Does my freedom depends on the arbitrary decision of a stranger, low ranking fictitious character, impersonator of a public official, that can act as accuser and judge at the same time?  \n4- Why would a REAL free man beg/ask for permission, to another man, to be \"free to go\"? \n5- Can any other man really hold that much power over another man, without consent?\n6- Wouldn't it be DELUSIONAL to ask a complete stranger if one is \"free to go\"?\n7- If there is such thing as IMMUNITY, would that have to be GRANTED by an AUTHORITY, or is something you just proclaim  in some paper, saying you just have it, \"because I say so\"? \n\nWhat the heck do I know?",
