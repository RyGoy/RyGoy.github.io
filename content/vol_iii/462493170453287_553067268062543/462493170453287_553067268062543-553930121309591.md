   "message": "\"We think wrong, and value the wrong things.\" I think one of the reasons Scott says we will never get trust law, or act as KINGS, is because the way our brains were/are programmed. \n\nWe are programed to NEVER be in the position of authority. Always looking for approval. Always asking for permission. Always asking for guidance, and direction. Always asking for instructions. Never fully taking responsibility, wanting for \"government\", and/or others, to \"do shit for us\", to tell us what to do, or what not to do.  I smell some hardcore voodoo-doodoo in all that.",
