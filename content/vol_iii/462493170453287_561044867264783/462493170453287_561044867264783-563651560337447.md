   "message": "the statute they're implementing can have no cause or effect if it breaches my right. I accept it was the paymasters instruction however i'm not clear on surety here. The implementation of such legislation by the pension section may constitute an unlawful order in this case...  the guy i'm writing to is surety until he tells me someone else has accepted responsibility... still no response from him ;)",
