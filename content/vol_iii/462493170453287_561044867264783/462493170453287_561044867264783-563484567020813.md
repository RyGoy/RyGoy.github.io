   "message": "Hello Mr. Parker,\n\n \n\nI wish to refer to your e-mail to Martin Hughes of this section earlier this week.\n\n \n\nSince late last year this Department has been writing to all those in receipt of a Defence Forces pension, who were being paid by cheque (payable order), informing them that, under the Government�s Public Service Reform Plan, payable orders were to be abolished as a method of payment for Government Departments. All those in receipt of such pensions were requested to forward details of a bank account into which all subsequent pension payments could be paid. Reminders issued during the current year and as of 31 August a large number of pensioners had replied with bank details.\n\n \n\nThis initiative is part of an overall Public Service Reform Plan dated 17 November 2011 and under the heading Banking Shared Services one of the objectives  was to �Abolish payable orders as a payment method for Government Departments with effect from mid 2013�.\n\n \n\nAs part of this reform plan the Paymaster General�s office issued the following instruction:\n\n \n\nPMG Banking will not be able to accept Payment Schedules to verify Payable Orders after 30 AUGUST, 2013. Payable Orders subsequently presented without the backing of a valid payment schedule will not be honored by PMG Banking. Payable Orders are being abolished as a method of payment from 30 August, 2013 under the Public Service Reform Plan.\n\nYou will see from all this that the move to EFT is part of an overall Government plan. This Department no longer has the facility to pay pensions by cheque and so all pensions must now be paid by EFT.\n\n \n\nYou should note that your pension is awaiting payment pending receipt of bank details. The appropriate form was sent to you and you should complete and return this form at your earliest convenience.\n\n \n\nFor your convenience I have attached a copy of the bank form which you can print off and complete.\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\n \n\nPhilip Neilan.\n\nPensions Payments.",
