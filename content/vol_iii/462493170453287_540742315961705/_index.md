   "message": "A question to all Natives of Turtle Island. I read a post today with quite a few case law studies that are indicating due to the BENEFIT of the so called PROTECTION OF THE CROWN. The European English Law of Canada has full right and jurisdiction over all lands and Nations across Turtle Island.  I questioned that position and i ask you now what is your thoughts on whether CANADA/US has any real claim to do what they do to the land and people whom are original to these lands?? Now, please post your views only, no need to name call or what not. Also, here is a reply to my questioning, this is a so called Native from the U.S. you tell me ??\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nor the record, I am not a Canadian but as someone in the United States that is Native American, people like you make me sick. We have your type here too - the people that cling to their ancestry in order to justify doing anything they don't want on the one hand while gladly taking every benefit they can from the government on the other hand. Your ancestry - in terms of the applicability of the law - is irrelevant. It applies to everyone in Canada, even you. No amount of screaming racism is going to change that. \nAlso, just for the record, nothing is YOUR land or YOUR resources. The ownership of land and resources is determined by the conquerors, not the conquered. You don't have to like it, but it is reality. Even if we were to accept your warped version of reality, the truth is what you think of as YOUR land and YOUR natural resources was at various times owned by other tribes before your tribe took it from them. That is what people did - they form groups and take stuff from other people. Yet somehow if we lived in your fantasy version of reality I doubt you'd want to determine just who REALLY owned what you think is your land, as if we looked I'd bet you just about all of it could be traced to being won by war or some other atrocity against another tribe. You going to hand all that land and resources back to them?",
