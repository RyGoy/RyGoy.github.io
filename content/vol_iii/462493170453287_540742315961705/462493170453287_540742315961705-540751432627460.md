   "message": "Since TRUST law is the highest form of law, it is a agreement between 2 parties... \n\n\n\nIt is not  that the people have been conquered but  rather they agreed to terms of a contract ( treaty) to benefit from the TRUST 60/40..\n\n\n\nAnd over time thru devious means, have cultivated our ignorance so we watch things like 24 and think it ok for Jack Bauer just to off people with callus disregard in order to protect us by ignoring everything our fore fathers died and fought for.. \n\n\n\nA systematic mutli-pronged approach facilitated by horrendous trauma, and then kicking them further while they are down for the count.\n\n\n\nNo one was conquered in Canada the people agreed to terms and then... look what's that over there... \n\n\n\nDo you wanna see me pull a rabbit from my hat..\n\n\n\nWhiskey  eases the pain and kills you early so here..\n\n\n\nCome to our schools and we will teach you to be civilized....  the ability to sue and be sued for what you naturally share amongst your selves..\n   Oh wait they are beaten now we have taken their children.... destroying the core of learning traditional ways, thru assimilation and degradation....\n\n\n\n\nFUCK.\n\n\n\nSo not conquered,   more liked tricked into acquiescence ...",
