   "message": "Interesting question.\nI was Born on this landmass. I do not care what word you might call that.\nI have a right to claim and hold land and resources as long as there is no current legitimate claim in place.\nIf I stop using said section of land and resources with no intent to use them with in the near future then I have abandoned what I claimed prior. Now others may claim as they wish.\nIt is all about claim and abandonment.\nThat is the way I see it.",
