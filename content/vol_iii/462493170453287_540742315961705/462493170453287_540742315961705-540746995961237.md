   "message": "1763 proclamation of King George supersedes all treaties and contracts, from my comprehension... the treaties were addendum's to said proclamation..\n\n   The constitution recognizes it...\n\nSo like us all, \n\n\n\nwe have been bamboozled into signing our rights away by taking the status given to us when we sign up for and receive the benefits from either SIN or Status card..\n\nOur resources are held in trust... and until we cross over back to original, \n\nwe are but meat puppets and cannon fodder...",
