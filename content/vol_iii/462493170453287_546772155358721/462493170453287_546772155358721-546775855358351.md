   "message": "It seems like deception from the start, the parents are not given full disclosure and so unwittingly aid and abett the fraud.\nParents then unwittingly convince the child 'IT' is that name, and so, on, through school, training, employent. \n\nOf course the taxes, etc are extracted and everyone, well almost everyone goes along with it because they believe they have to.\n\nThen there's the signature, sign of nature, proof of life, which is required for credit/debt creation.\nIt seems the all caps name, deadman, \nNeeds the rejoinder to the living energy of the 'sign'-er, living being/consciousness,  in order to make this work.\n\nIn this way, I can see they are urging, confusing, and coercing the living flesh being to make representation of the deadman..\n\nBinding him to it.\nVia a summoning of the dead.\n\nOtherwise known as necromamcy.\nIt's sorcery of mind.\n\nI think it makes the sometimes confused use of Gods Law, easier to understand, as true law, rather than the cartoon guy in the sky.\n\nTrue law, because it is in opposition to word magic, deception, etc.\n\nI'm pretty sure the signature is mine.\nBut its not for signing their binding spells with.\nIt's for signing the silver bullets to bring their shit down.",
