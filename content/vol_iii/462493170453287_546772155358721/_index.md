   "message": "Recently I've been thinking, trying to get back to real basics, what is my name - who owns it? Is it mine? And if it is then where is the proof? Seroiusly, if MY name is MINE where is proof of ownership? This is where I need to start. Quite frankly I don't feel confident in saying 'My name is such-and.such,cos folk,s I'm not sure it really is MINE. Now I wouldn'nt want to participat in a fraud, so if if isn't MINE then why should I use it?\nHere in tender for law the subject may have been broached but I can't find it (help me please if my facebook searching is inadequate). Scott this is your place, maybe I missed something...you know.\nWhat I'm getting at is: I've given up all benefits from the state and declared independence, and I'm comfortable with that. But a few questions remain, maybe others ask this too:  .....oh shit...nobody wants to address this...\noh what the fuck, I'm just gonna say it...\nCOUNTRIES. Yeah, slave camps. \"I'm a proud American, OR I'm a proud Canadian OR i'm a proud Norwegian or Tongan OR I'm a...you get the idea. Please folks get out of that mindset, we're just folks trying to get along. \nAll that crazy freeman stuff is great wheh you've got 'constitutions' and 'bills of rights' and stuff, but did you ever think that folks in the old world haven't got that? We REALLY don't have that, but we're folks like you.  We're under ancient monarchies. We really all need to pull together and realise that old borders are crap. Powerise your Bullshit-O-Meter, and see that when it smells like shit is probably is SHIT. We gotta pull together. And about the Name...I need to know I own it or I'm not going to use it.\nVerbiage welcome :)",
