   "message": "You can call yourself anything you like, as long as that is not done for any unlawful or fraudulent purpose.\nThe name your parents gave you was to identify you from others within society, instead of you being identified as 'Hey You!', and that name will be shown of your Registration of Live Birth (from which is created the Birth Certificate). Consequently, you are the Man/Woman known as Mik Hartwell. Mik Hartwell is only the beneficiary of the PERSON called MIK HARWELL, and not the Trustee or Surety. Who ever created and used the name for the PERSON, MIK HARTWELL, owns that name by creation and, therefore, is the Trustee with the liability of Surety.",
