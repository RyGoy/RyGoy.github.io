   "message": "I'm really sorry James but most of the stuff you have listed is not the fact.  the bandwagon case against the bank has no standing & Tom D'arcy is suppressing documents which would prove it, ask him ;) \"Licensing is the reserve of the central bank\", he's a liar either through stupidity or method. Its not until you find yourself in this position that you begin to understand what is wrong with the information being passed as fact in Ireland by Ben gilroy/tns/debt options/tom d'arcy et al. any help that could be given to you here will battle with already held & wrong beliefs. The contents of this page have revealed a lot to me. scroll to january & start reading, we all need to figure this out for ourselves, we cant be reliant on someone elses word as you have found for yourself writing this today. Best of luck!",
