   "message": "At 11:22 this morning I received a phone call from my tenant panicking after a thug acting for Ulster bank banged on the door of my property in Tramore, Co. Waterford with a summons to the Circuit court in Waterford City. When the tenant opened the door she was greeted by a large thuggish man with handcuffs hanging off his belt, who pushed straight past her and moved through the house, checking the rooms demanding to know where I was. I was not there as I live up the country now and have for a while. Just to point out from the start of this story, I have a case in the High court since last November, a valid case that the bank does not have a claim over the property for many reasons, including: they sold on the original loan agreement with my signature as a financial instrument through a process known as securitisation, they are in breach of contract law by their actions, they are insolvent as a business and it is illegal to trade while insolvent, they have no banking license and other claims. Also, and one of the most important, they were at no loss of accounting as they never loaned me any cash in the first place, my signature created the credit. \n\nBack to the story; this thug acting for Ulster bank had no lawful authority to enter the premises and he was not invited, all he had the power to do was issue a summons. He had no order for repossession. THIS IS TRESPASS, a common law crime. He did not leave his name or any contact details. Two Gardai were with him, watched him enter the property and did not interfere when he unlawfully entered the property. He threatened the tenant with eviction. His actual words were \"You will be out of here by xmas\". There is a young child living in the property with his mother. He was screaming with distress. This man threatened to take all property in the near future regardless if it was mine or the tenants. He also said and I quote \"You don't have to give this summons to him if you don't want to\". The reason why he would say that is because he said he knows I have a case in the high court against Ulster bank, if I , or others like me win, it will open the flood gates. They are trying to get a repossession order in the lower court to stop my case before it is heard. WE ARE HAVING AN IMPACT! They are now panicking and sending heavies in to try and intimidate people who are bringing lawful claims against the corrupt banks into the court. \n\nTo say I am shocked and upset by the blatant breaking of the law of the land while members of An Garda Siochana stand idly by, is an understatement. I was lawfully and civilly dealing with this through the courts, while Ulster Bank have now lowered themselves to sending in scum and scaring the life out of women and children without even a court order in hand. I will use all means necessary to find out who this criminal was who without lawful authority entered my home and seek a criminal prosecution against him for trespass. If we have no law, we have nothing in society. THIS HAS TO STOP NOW!\nJames.",
