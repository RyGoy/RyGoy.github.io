   "message": "Jason F. LeBlanc I live in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. We don't have a police station only RCMP detachment. We have a University here, and the campus security takes care of the town during the early hours of the morning so that the RCMP can go to bed at night. That is it no cops, no military police, oh yeah we do have a bylaw enforcement officer, and a dog catcher. That is it.",
