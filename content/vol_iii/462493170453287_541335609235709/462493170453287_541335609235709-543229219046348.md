   "message": "This morning I made a call to CPS cause they called yesterday and I thought that may be they were going to tell me something about my youngest. When I called this morning the regular fat cow that is the supervisor was gone on vacation till next week, but I did talk to the acting supervisor, I asked him if my property was going to be retuned to me. He asked what property that would be. I told him my flesh and blood daughter Caorle. He stated that they would be having a case conference today and that he wanted to know if they could come on the property to take a look around. I told him no. He asked a second time and told him no again. Then he stated that it was interesting that I asked for only one daughter to be returned and that is when I hung up the phone on him. So that is where the whole situation sits right now. I still don't know were my youngest is and Friday will mark 2 weeks since I've seen her.",
