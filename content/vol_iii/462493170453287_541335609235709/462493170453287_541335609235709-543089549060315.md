   "message": "one more funny thing that happened, last week the kid went to macdonalds with friends, we only have one macdonalds in this town. Someone turned the kid in because one cop turned up there after someone the kid knew left the restaurant and then very shortly after 2 more cop cars showed up. So the kid and her friends ran out a side door, and went to a totally different part of town. That was close.",
