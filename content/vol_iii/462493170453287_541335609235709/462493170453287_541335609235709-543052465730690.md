   "message": "one other thing that I forgot to say was it took me a couple of days but when I voided the court order, I thought that I could have been charged with defacing a document or tampering with it. When I went to the court house a second time to get a true certified copy of it and was told that the original had been tampered, I didn't pay much attention at the time. But a few days later I thought well what is the difference between tampered and defaced. I looked up defaced and it meant mar or destroy the face. But she had said tampered. So I looked that word up and it stated to corrupt and something else, I looked up corrupt. It stated something and then to vitiate. I looked up vitiate and it stated something and also to void or make voidable. So there you have it. void. I know that we are headed for a show down either very shortly or by Aug 19, which is when my next pretrial is.",
