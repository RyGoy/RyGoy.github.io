   "message": "Yea I AM a TRoll Thats why I was in hand cuffs in my driveway on July 3rd....Had a gun drawn at my brother in law and my partner went to the hospital in an abulance and hand cuffs. They released him 2 hours later. Please don't mistake my ignorance for any thing else. We are new to the Law movement(Nov 2012) as such, but we have BEEN through FIRE with dangerous people that did NOT want their money making rackett exposed. And that was before we knew any of this stuff. CHP in Cal changed one of their programs -not because they were harming people but my partnerand another person exposed a liability.(He didn't make much off of that suit but did end up screwing three lawyers out their cut) If I do it right I can troll for dollars on the faulse arrest and other things....Thanks",
