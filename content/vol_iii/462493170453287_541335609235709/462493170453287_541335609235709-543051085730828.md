   "message": "A couple of weeks ago I went into the courthouse and voided the Temporary Care and Custody Order. I then went and picked up my one daughter but was unsuccessful in getting my youngest. CPS tried to contact me and the daughter but we did not respond. CPS issued another order for locating and detaining the kid. I went down to the courthouse to get a true certified copy of the voided order. They said I couldn�t have it and now the order was in the judges hands to see what to do with it but I could get an older copy that I had sent back to them. Told me it wasn�t the same thing. I told them no I wanted true certified copy. I went back the next day, because it had been family court day and the judge would have made a decision on it, looking for a true certified copy. Told me again that I could not have, that it had been tampered with, but I could have an older copy that I had sent back and the court clerk had checked it out and was willing to stamp it as true certified. Again I told her that that was not a true certified copy and refused it. I then walked out. As I was walking out two deputy sheriffs where standing in front of an RCMP officer, and as I was leaving the office, the officer called me by my first name. I said yes, and he told me that he had an order to locate and detain and wanted to know if the kid was with me. I said no. He then asked if the kid was with me last night and thought about it for a minute and asked if I was under arrest and he said no. I said well good bye if I�m not under arrest, and walked out of the courthouse. The next day I walked into the courthouse again and asked for a true certified copy of the locate and detain order and voided that, and knowing that they would not take anything I registered mailed it back to them. In the mean time I tried to go for a visit with my youngest and they didn�t bring her for the first visit on the Monday, nor did they bring her for her visit on the Wednesday. On Wednesday I again waited for the supervisor of cps to come out, and this time she did within 5 minutes. On Monday she left me sitting there for 15 and I left. She called me into the office, All I wanted to know was was I going to have a visit or not. The only other thing that has happened is that I don�t know for fact whether it was RCMP or CPS, (I�m thinking CPS) called the middle daughter�s boyfriends parents and told them that what is going on here on our property is terrible stuff and that our place is a dangerous place and that even the cops are scared to come on the property. And of course the boyfriend�s parents are freaking out. So the kid went and told cps that she had gone home. In the meantime not one RCMP officer or cps agent has showed up at the house, and tomorrow it will be two weeks since she left. I listened very intently to Karl Lentz and did up a simple statement of claim and tried to file it yesterday, but while I was at the court house trying to file it, I asked to see the prothonontary or the deputy prothonotary. Instead I got the headcheese, the court administrator. She took my paper work and said that she would look it over and be back out. It took her 10 minutes at least to come back out, I knew that something was going on. So when she did finally come back out she started talking to me about fees and whatever, and then she told me that CPS supervisor was on the line and wanted to talk to me. For five minutes I grilled her as to how they knew that I was there and why would they want to talk to me? She said everything but that I phoned and told them you were here. I saw that I was running in circles so t changed the subject back to filing my claim. After a couple of minutes I again asked her, did you phone cps and why? She just gave me a blank stupid stare and then I told her that it was quite of obvious to me that her silence spoke volumes. And she never responded to my question. I was done with my paper work at that time and I walked out. I did go back into the courthouse and did some more with my paperwork. It will be finalized and filed today. Yesterday I also dropped off a notice to cps that stated for every second that I was deprived of my property that I was charging them $1.00.",
