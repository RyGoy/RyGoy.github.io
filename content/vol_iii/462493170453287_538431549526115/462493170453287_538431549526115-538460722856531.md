   "message": "Shady Trust was in reference to a comment by another poster about Aquilae.\n\nAnd yes, I am fully aware of that outline, however...in order to create a Corporation here in the States (and what you defined may be construed as a Corp Sole) one needs to produce either a Social Security Number, or other identifying number.  Scott also mentioned buying one in Delaware.  I actually already have one that was created under a former SSN that I used to use....but how does one create a corporation and keep MYSELF completely separate?\n\n\"Draw up a Trust agreement\" - how?  And doesn't a TRUST just hold property?  How, if I personally have the property in my private capacity, do I start a corporation privately?\n\nAlso, if I have a corporation, how do I make it so it doesn't have its VALUE stolen through bureaucracy and Statutes?\n\nAnd this ^ is where I am getting lost",
