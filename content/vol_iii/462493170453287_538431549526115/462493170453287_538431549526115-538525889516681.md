   "message": "In the Contract-class i was taking, we touched on Trusts BRIEFLY. However, someone did have a question regarding setting up a Trust, and the answer the Instructor gave who is a lawyer was- \"A Trust can be set-up through nothing more than a contract\"\n\nOf course- being the only one in my class apart of this group i immediately shot my hand up- \"All ive ever heard about setting-up a Trust, is that you have to create a corporation in order to do it.\" \n\nHer answer was- \"Well, you can do that too, if you choose to\"\n\n\"OK, but going by what you just said there- you made it sound like you dont necessarily have to set-up a corporation, in order to set-up a Trust...and that a Trust could be set-up SOLELY through the making of a contract.\"\n\nHer answer: \"Yes. You dont necessarily have to go through setting-up a corporation, you're right.\"\n\n'Wise-man' once told me- \"The CONTRACT she is referring to, is the CHARTER required of in setting-up any Trust\"",
