   "message": "Derek Moran Is it true that if I include my bc with my court documents the bc inclusion will place me in the position of executor and beneficiary?  I also heard that any document presented in the courts must be notarized or the judge may ignore the document. If the above suggestions are true would I then need to have my bc notarized, and by doing so would be altering the bc?  Would notarizing my bc place me in harms way, and should I include it with my court documents?",
