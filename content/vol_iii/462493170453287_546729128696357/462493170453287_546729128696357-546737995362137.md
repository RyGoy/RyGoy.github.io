   "message": "Isn't the  birth certificate copyrighted. \nIf so who owns the copyright.\nIt's not us, we receive no more than a receipt/copy.\n\nWhat I would like to know, is \nIs it the certificate itself that is under copyright ?\nOr is the name under copyright also, \n\nMy thinking is this, if the name is owned by another, how can anything acquired through it belong to anyone but the owner.\n\nAnd if this is the case, isn't the birth certificate proof of the fraud, and the setting up of offices, agents, buying paper, ink, etc represent proof of intent to deceive and defraud.",
