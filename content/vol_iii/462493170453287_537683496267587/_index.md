   "message": "I think this is morally deficient/deviant and identifies many concerns. From a TFL perspective, however, maybe this can help us to see that there is detachment between the flesh man/woman/child and their PERSON.\n\n As Pierre says, they own the PERSON. They obviously feel righteous in using it in any way they see fit. To be emotionally attached or otherwise to our PERSON can be traumatizing.\n\nThe identity they used was the name of the child's PERSON which they own via the birth certificate. Using the PERSON's BC,  they were able to obtain a passport in the PERSON's name.",
