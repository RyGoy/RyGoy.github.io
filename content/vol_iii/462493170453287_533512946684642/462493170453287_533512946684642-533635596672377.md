   "message": "FYI, it's Dunningï¿½Kruger. Thanks for the inclusion, but seriously, how do I make these lists?\n\nOne day you're innocently filling out a form, including as requested, your name, address, DOB, income bracket, number of dependents, educational credentials, pet's names...and you think, \"But that's OK. After all I could win a big-screen TV!\" And the next, you're being sent a *free* credit card, a request for money from a charitable organization, notification that you've won a free cruise; or you're being included in a thank-you list with a bunch of heavy-hitters.\n\nI'm truly flattered to be included in such company Jason, keep in touch.  I can't help wondering, however, why I never seem to win the big-screen TV :D",
