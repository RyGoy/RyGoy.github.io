   "message": "I am still learning proper form and etiquette.  I know this is Scott's group.   I have been helped by Tara's encouraging words and was dumbstruck after reading about the loss of home as it was stolen by people colouring outside the lines it struck me and stuck with me, Scott's brainpower and pointing me in the right direction his courage for standing up for what he knows.\n\nIt is with the utmost respect for ALL who are learning on this page.  I do not want to waste anyones time by posting  crap.  I am in a life and death struggle. I get It.  The rcmp where kicking down doors and stealing peoples property under the guise of public safety here in the hot bed of Alberta.  The PUBLIC SAFETY  crap is beginning.... lost your home... come have a shower....  sounds oddly familiar... about 70 years ago...  I am seriously doing my best to get the fuck out of dodge... time is running out I see it around me.",
