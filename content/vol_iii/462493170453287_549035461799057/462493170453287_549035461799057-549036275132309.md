   "message": "My understanding, is because a married couple is considered one 'person', then the other party is the state...either party can terminate the relationship/contract at any time (like any contract), BUT my biggest question is this:\n\nHow are the goods and chattels then divided up? (especially as any product of the union is considered chattel property- I'm thinking specifically about the issue of children being taken by the state)",
