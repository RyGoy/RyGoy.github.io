Of course these reasons to believe are based on some recent information I've received from Scott Duncan and Dean Clifford......\n\nYou have 30 days to send to me FULL DISCLOSURE of this Marriage business deal.\n\nIf I don't receive an answer from YOU, me and Nadine will consider this MARRIAGE nul and void.\n\nThank You\nBY:________________\nMaster of PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX",
