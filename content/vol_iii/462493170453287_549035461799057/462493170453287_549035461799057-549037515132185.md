   "message": "Scenario:  You & I engage in a business contract....we work together for say 7 years and then the contract is voided for whatever reason...\n\nIf we don't have an agreement in place as to how the chattel property is to be divided (prior to our terminating our agreement), then we either agree, negotiate or 'duke' it out as Beverly Girl-Brain Braaksma suggested.\n\nDoes the state already have an exit clause in place, or do they just presume that they control and/or own the chattel property & it's up to us to negate these presumptions (as in Notice of Mistake re children/person/chattel property etc)?",
