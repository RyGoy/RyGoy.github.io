   "message": "And as Dean says, \"I was not given full disclosure regarding the license\" is kind of a big thing ;) ... You didn't know you were entering into a legal contract with the STATE, which would allow them to govern the affairs of your marriage - till death do you part :)\n\nYou just did it because you were 'coerced' by your pastor; by the STATE; by everyone you've ever known your entire life, and of course alcohol, into believing you MUST have a marriage license, when in fact, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nYou just wanted to have sex with the guy, but your pastor said you'd go to hell and burn-burn-burn for all eternity if you didn't get married first ;)\n\nYou are a victim :)",
