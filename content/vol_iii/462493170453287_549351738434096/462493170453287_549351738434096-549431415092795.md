   "message": "I'm currently going through a process where I attempted to discharge a bill...the bank has dishonoured, making a number of baseless claims and statements, so I had to verify every step of my process factually (using the clubhouse rules they are bound by) to prove up my process.\n\nIt has been slow going, but it has absolutely locked into my brain that what we are doing here is correct.  \n\nMy plan from here is to only engage in actions that I can demonstrate every step of my process using objective evidence...\n\nI think this will be useful for swearing affidavits & using a lien process in the future :D",
