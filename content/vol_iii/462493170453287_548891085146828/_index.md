   "message": "TO THOSE WHO THINK PROTESTING IS VALID, and cite Egypt as an example:\n\nI hate to say \"I TOLD YOU SO\", but...\n\n...wait, who am I kidding? I LOVE saying \"I told you so\". That's one of the benefits of not being \"spiritual\"... I'm not delusional, so I'm right more often. :D\n\nPoint being; PROTESTS DON'T WORK. PROTESTS GRANT AUTHORITY.\n\nSTOP PROTESTING. IT DOES NOT WORK, AND HAS NEVER WORKED.\n\nQ.E.D. ---> EGYPT.",
