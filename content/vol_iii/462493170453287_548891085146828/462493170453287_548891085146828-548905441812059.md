   "message": "Want to change things? Put a bullet between the eyes of the people who sign these laws/orders/warrants. That is the ONLY thing that will change things. Nothing else works. Pick up a history book and see.\n\nEven Ukraine's \"Orange Revolution\" didn't gain traction until Ministers started getting their skulls ventilated (Or their wives and daughters raped and killed in front of them... It's Ukraine after all. They do it \"russian\" style).\n\n...but The Ukraine suffers from too much history. The people know when it's time to kill government workers...\n\nIn North America, Black Hitler will have people in FEMA camps LONG before anyone thinks of solving the problem. America HAS no history to refer to. Only plunder.",
