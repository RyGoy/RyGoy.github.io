   "message": "What is a promissory note? A Flagstaff Hill man, 33, has been arrested for deception offences after allegedly passing fraudulent promissory notes across Adelaide. Police will allege he presented the promissory notes to a number of financial institutions via ATM deposits. One promissory note was presented at a retail outlet. The investigation is still ongoing and anyone with information that may assist should contact police. Promissory notes are not legal tender and have no value. Police advise the public if you are presented with a promissory note, do not accept it, and contact police.\nhttps://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1002983_503936179683729_1207125720_n.jpg",
