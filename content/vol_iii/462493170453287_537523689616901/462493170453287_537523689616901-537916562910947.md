   "message": "This is the bloke with the \"Australian constitution\" page...I believe pete is his name from memory. I chatted briefly with him a ways back about this very issue prior to these latest troubles. \n\nThe reason they're after him is because he's trying to pass his notes off as money of exchange rather than money of account in direct and willing competition to the Australian national bank and is going around promoting others to do the same. \n\nSo in this case it's a bigger issue than just using promissory notes...it's a turf war.) and I don't see a happy ending with that sort of crusade. \n\nIsn't the abundance of commercial remedies currently at hand enough...do we really want to, or even need to go toe to toe with a giant gorilla...each to their own I guess.\n\nPeace.",
