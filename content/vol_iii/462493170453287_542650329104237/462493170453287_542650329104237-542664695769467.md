   "message": "So im talking to a classmate during the bathroom break tonight. She wants me to explain to her again what a By-Law is. I start to tell her- \"Well, Bouviers Law Dictionary 1856 says..\" She cuts me off. \"Oh, no-no-no...\" I ask her what she means. \"Oh that doesnt count\". . .\"What do you mean- 'that doesnt count?'\". . .\"That one's too OLD. The definitions have CHANGED since then\" I try not to be rude, so i say- \"The definition of a By-Law has CHANGED since then? Bouviers Law is one of THE most respected Law Dictionaries, you HAVE heard of it before - right?\". . . .\"No,\" she answers - and she wants to be a PARALEGAL! LOL",
