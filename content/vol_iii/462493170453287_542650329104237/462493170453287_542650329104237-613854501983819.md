   "message": "Scott Duncan: The 1960 Bill Of Rights has every LEGAL protection for your Sovereignty and is still in effect today. Dean Clifford likes to \"Stump the Stooges\" with this ugly reality, often.\n\nThe Wikipedia entry for it is worded... Interestingly.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights\n\nScott Duncan: \"The Canadian Bill of Rights remains in effect, but its widely acknowledged ineffectiveness[citation needed (Because there is none to be had!)]was the main reason that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was adopted in 1982.\" - Crap. By \"ineffectiveness\", they mean that they couldn't create joinder on you by presumption.",
