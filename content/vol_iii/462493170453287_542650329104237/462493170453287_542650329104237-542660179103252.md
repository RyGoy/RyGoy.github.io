   "message": "She loves me with every fibre of her being, don't get me wrong... But these days she is sure noticing how little money we have, and thinks that 27 Million would be handy these days. It's hard not to give me \"that look\", and I can't blame her. I do it to myself these days...but that's what it cost to change the conditions of the test back then...\n\n...I think I would like 27 Million. I think I'd like you to give it to Tara.\n\nOh, didn't I mention? You are going to give it to me. You will do it gladly, and when you have given her all that you have, you will get all that your friends have, and they will hand it over gladly!\n\nAsk yourself why I should believe such an odd thing. ;)",
