   "message": "So Derek Moran today my probation officer tells me that the papers i signed with him are non-negotiable. But not anywhere in the documents does it say non-negotiable. Funny you posted this because he also leaned to the opinion that i had concidered and accepted the terms, even though i didn't want to, i remained SILENT, and signed the documents, so therefore its non-negotiable. Does that make any sense? Which brings me back to DURESS i concidered an AGREEMENT under THREAT of INCARCERATION. Obviously duress.",
