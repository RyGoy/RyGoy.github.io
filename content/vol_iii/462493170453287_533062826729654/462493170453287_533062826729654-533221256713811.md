   "message": "Great video!  I lack information and the rules of their game - that's where my fear emanates from.  If I'm forced to appear in court, should I bring my birth certificate into court with me?  Would that assist me in any way with supporting the fact that I'm a living person, and yes an event took place that was recorded and a legal fiction was created, but I am the executor of the legal fiction and the judge is the trustee.  Does anyone recommend doing that, or do you recommend not bring the BC into court at all?",
