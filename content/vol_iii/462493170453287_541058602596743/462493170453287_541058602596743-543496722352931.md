   "message": "Just FYI we have been in contact with Dean Kory and are working with him to secure his release. For the time being per his request we are shuttling documents, holding regular visits for updates and standing by should he request further assistance. things are progressing well and he is safe and well protected, (THE BOYS) have his back and the justice on his case is sympathetic so far ordering the jail and police to facilitate and not interfere with his access to what he needs to prepare his case.",
