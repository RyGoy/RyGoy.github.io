I have had agents side up to me and they either turn or run screaming for the hills. If through ignorance you feel there is a safe haven on the INTERNET or even in your own home then you are clearly deluding yourselves, and the matter is a waste of time in my opinion as you have far deeper issues to tend with. \n\nNow if it is a game like \"RED HAT\" and there be a prize, well now we be talking. ;) LOL",
