   "message": "Yeah, who knows? These guys try to make summaries which they feed up the line. I Know I should care less butI was  born curious. I wonder about these guys, you know, they have to sleep at nigt - how do they do it? Making a buck? -- Hey, intel guys, think about what you're here for! -- anyway, funy story: he Danish intel guys grovel like worms for foreign agencies, and the foreign intel knows that, so they bait the smalltime wanna-be's (maybe canadians have a simlar story). \nAnyhow, this forum is great, and I appreciategood feedback, and thought we migh bring in our covert friends - they're just folks like us.",
