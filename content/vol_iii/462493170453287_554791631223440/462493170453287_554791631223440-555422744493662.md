   "message": "Although not at the level of smart contained in Scott Duncan, I can see where this is going. How unfortunate that, even with evidence to back it up, people will look at it tell you it doesn't work that way and get back in the lemming line. I realise that I was one of those people for a different reason. I couldn't figure out why what I \"know\" wasn't what logical. It wasn't because I was wrong about what I thought, it was how i thought about it. It was the processes I had followed because, like everyone else, it was shown to be the only \"right\" way by those in authority. Thank you Dean Clifford, for beginning to show me this wrong thinking and to Scott for helping to remove the blinders. Sincerely, ME",
