   "message": "^^ Please don't ban me for this comment! I don't make a claim that I can be sure of anyone's the motive, yet, something smells in Bangkok. Regarding the who smokes weed post .....I asked which admin approved that post. I wondered which admin thought that not only would such a post provide real value to our common objectives here at TFL, and, also thought it would be a good idea for group members to inform on themselves and publicly announce their participation in illegal activities. No admin stepped up to the plate to admit approving that post. Having said that, I realize an admin could have been drunk when they approved it, or otherwise mentally incompetent at the time. I mean no disrespect to any admins here. I just couldn't (and still can't) see what the value any admin would see in such a post, nor can I comprehend why an admin would think that a post requesting that people publicly admit their criminal behaviour was a post worth approving. Just sayin. That POST REEKED of RATS in Bangkok. Would the admin that thought that post had real value for the group step forward now? We're you drunk at the time? What value did you think that post would provide the group? Shutting up now lest I step on an admin's nerve.",
