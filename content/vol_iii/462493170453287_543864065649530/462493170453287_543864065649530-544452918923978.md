Listen to the simple questioning methods, and the answers, taking into consideration that most people are not accustomed to holding up under even the most rudimentary questions, and there is a natural unease at being informed your conversation is recorded.  \n\nIn any situation where you want to establish facts you should be able to drill down to the basic information.  If the person you are questioning is telling the truth they should be able to answer.  If they are accomplished liars you have another issue altogether.\n\nWere the facts of the situation established?  Does the chronology ring true?  Do you have sufficient information to determine what actually transpired?  Or are you being manipulated at the emotional level?  That would be for you to decide.",
