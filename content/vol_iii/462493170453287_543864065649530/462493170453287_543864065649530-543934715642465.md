I guess I'm doomed. \n\nImportant notes about Derek's Tender for Bullshit:\n\n1- Never initiate hostile intent/contact.\n2- One MUST NEVER attorn.\n3- If one attorns, one is fucked.\n4- Signing under the threat of \"duress\" or \"a beating\" is for pussies, for then one ATTORNS. Now, signing under the threat of getting your legs kicked, is for mega-pussies, apparently.\n5- Before one does/acts on anything, one MUST know WHY we are doing things. (that should be a dead giveaway)\n6- If anyone is trying to kill you, you better do some shit about it.\n7- NEVER lie to Scott. \n\nHe did help to bring out some gold nuggets from Scott. Thanks Derek, I'll miss you, wish you well!",
