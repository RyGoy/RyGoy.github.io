   "message": "Funny you should say that, ChiefRock. Derek Hill lives in Windsor. When i was in Windsor earlier this year for a week, we talked on the phone a few times. But he was constantly like ChiefRock said, kept asking to meet. Then when he was going to Ottawa this summer and had a layover at Union Station here in Toronto, again, kept asking for me to come see him during his layover at Union Station wanting to meet. The truth is im quite anti-social. I go to bars by myself, and i go to movies by myself. When people ask me- \"How can you go to a movie BY YOURSELF??\"...i answer...\"Because im not INSECURE as YOU ARE\" ;)",
