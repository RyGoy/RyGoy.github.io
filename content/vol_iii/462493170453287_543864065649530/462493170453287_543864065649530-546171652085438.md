   "message": "We have the King James 1st edition. It was well over $100 ca. It is pretty weird to read. It just sounds ludicrous to me the whole time I am reading it. I haven't read much of the new test cause that is what they focus on more in church (grew up in church and bible college while dad was becoming pastor). It's the \"nicer\" part of the bible. I love the quote Scott Duncan posted in Gail Blackman's thread about finding this being and \"killing\" it. I think that IS what we are doing as it is a fairy tale and exposing it for what it is \"kills\" it.",
