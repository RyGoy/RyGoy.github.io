   "message": "Although i dont know if this story is 100% true, i can assure you stupid shit goes on in jail alot like he spoke about. Not quite sure its exactly like that but mainly they will take your food or provoke a fight so you catch another charge so you stay longer. Initiation is something i havent heard of before but i can see it happening with the likes of Derek seeing he is only 105 soaking wet and guys in Detention Center have nothing better to do than to fuck with the new guy LOL, i know i been in jail with alot worse guys who would just sneak up behind you and choke you til you passed out lol, never happened to be of course but im 6'2 235lbs who wont back down from anyone. Anyways, its my 2cents...my friends been held for like 2-3months for their court dates on dead time. So 30 can be normal limit but i would say its not always the rule from my experience. Anyone else ? I been to jail twice, well before i learned what i know. I was an ignoramus before LOL !!",
