   "message": "In general,do people really have \"free\" will? is it their own? what does a slave know of freedom, somewhere along the line i picked up a story about the emancipation of the slaves in america, how they partied that night, how they celebrated their new freedom & how they got up the next morning & went back to the fields. that story always stuck in me, those people loved their children, no doubt but they also infected them with their slave mentality,i'm sure within the slave community there was every descrption of individual including the free willed slave,the irish were the original slave & that mentality still flourishes here, i prided myself in the army because i was known as \"ohh him\" i thought i couldn't be tamed ... but standing here now looking back i was fooling myself, things are \"less\" cloudy for me now but only from the perspective of total white out... ever deeper i suppose :)",
