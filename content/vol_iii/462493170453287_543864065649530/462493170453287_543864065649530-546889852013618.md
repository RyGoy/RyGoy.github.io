   "message": "So there we were, sitting around, trying to come up with the big finish, and Kate spotted a spider the size of a Buick (no, really).  So two women spring into action.  We briefly discuss whether a fly swatter will do the job - there was no consensus, so I approached with caution and whacked it with the dollar store fly swatter.  Possibly dead, probably stunned...it floated slowly down to the ground and landed in one of those self-cleaning ash trays with the plunger that drops the butts into the container.  Quicker than you can imagine, Kate leaps up and hammers the plunger sending the mostly dead spider to his 1) dusty demise 2) ashy fate 3) butt bone-yard.  Girl power!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
