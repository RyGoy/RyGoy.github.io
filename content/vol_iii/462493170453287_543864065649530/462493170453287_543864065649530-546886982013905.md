I invented it, Bartholomew named it.�\n\n�Well, if the village idiot named it, I�m sure it�s a good thing.�\n\n�There you go, you got it.�\n\n�Got what?�\n\n�Sarcasm.�\n\n�No, I meant it.�\n\n�Sure you did.�\n\n�Is that sarcasm?�\n\n�Irony, I think.�\n\n�What�s the difference?�\n\n�I haven�t the slightest idea.�\n\n�So you�re being ironic now, right?�\n\n�No, I really don�t know.�\n\n�Maybe you should ask the idiot.�\n\n�Now you�ve got it.�\n\n\"What?\"\n\n�Sarcasm.� \n\n- Christopher Moore, \"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal\"",
