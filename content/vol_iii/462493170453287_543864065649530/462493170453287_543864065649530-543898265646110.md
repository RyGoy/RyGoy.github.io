   "message": "Well the client i helped Mr Green, he got a probation order on him before trial, they even threw him in jail for 3days because he didnt go. So, i guess it works different for different provinces but either way that is what took place for mr green, actually in the audio you can hear the judge in one of them asking why he missed probation ....i guess they just offer them up no willy nilly cause no one knows how to assert their contracts ?",
