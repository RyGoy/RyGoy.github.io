   "message": "He was convicted the day before of a charge laid before that?\n\nLIES.\n\n...and it's A FUCKING DETENTION CENTRE, not a PRISON. There's no \"initiation\". They NEVER make you sign anything, EVER. Write \"VOID\" on it... what are they going to do? Make a NEW order? VOID THAT TOO... fuck, they GAVE it to you to void!\n\nIf you sign ANYTHING, because you are \"afraid\", then you are a little bitch. There is no room for little bitches in my life...some of which gets spent here.\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: You feel free to verify Derek Hill's \"story\"... when you find that my position is correct, you may report to the bridge for your dick-slapping. There's a good cum-bunny. Off you go! Check out the facts, quick as you like!\n\n...then report for your \"discipline\" for daring to question my position. :P",
