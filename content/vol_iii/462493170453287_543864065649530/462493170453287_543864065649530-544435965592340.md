   "message": "Valid point, Chad Brodgesell.  I hate to deviate from the bullshit theme, but it is a universal problem.  Everyone loves a controversy, and everyone loves to judge and speculate without evidence or proof.\n\nHere, of all places, the focus should be on determining the facts, probing for details, and making informed decisions about the veracity of any claim.\n\nI have mentioned on occasion that this is not a dating site, nor should it be a forum to vent your prejudices or personal issues.  There are very simple and basic ways to determine the facts in any situation which Scott demonstrates on a daily basis.\n\nEither you're a team of people working toward a common goal, or you're a bunch of folks in co-dependent relationships.  You are all in a position to extract great value from some of the most erudite thinkers I have encountered in some time.  How you choose to leverage that knowledge and information will determine your success in your ventures.",
