   "message": "When I was a child my family took me to the nearest large city to see one of those children's comedians.  Walking up to the venue I walked into some aging, alcoholic man and stepped on his foot.  I was overcome with joy when I realized I had stepped on none other than the man himself.  I smiled and squealed with joy, exclaiming, \"Aren't you Uncle Billy?\"  He looked at me and slurred \"Fuck off kid!\"\n\nOk, I stepped on him and got his name wrong.
