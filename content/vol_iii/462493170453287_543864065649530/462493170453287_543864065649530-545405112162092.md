   "message": "I am clear. No misunderstanding there. I try very hard not to bullshit. At least I am trying. VERY trying. I really think I don't have much to offer, besides bullshit, a LOT of the time. So sometimes I am sucked in and want some one to know I am reading and creeping. I apologize. Don't know if any one notices, but when I see a string of bullshit that I have pulled out of my ass and helps no one, I have deleted it. If it would please the ones with administrator status, ANY of my posts that are seen as just \"taking up space\" and offering no info that is of value may be deleted. Not that I think you need my permission. If it makes some one laugh, yay. But it need not stay. I could also scroll thru and delete as a \"homework\" assignment at any admin's request. I'm not even sure I am completely qualified to decide what IS bullshit. I am pretty sure I can tell if something is COMPLETE bullshit tho.",
