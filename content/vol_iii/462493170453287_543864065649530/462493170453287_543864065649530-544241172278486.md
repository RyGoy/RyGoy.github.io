   "message": "The few times i spoke with Derek , he would ask after telling him ive spoke with Scott before on the phone- \"Do you have a recording of your phone-call with Scott?\" What made it so awkward though, was the second-time he asked me on another call, where i had to point out to him- \"Uhhh, yeah, actually, you asked me that same question before, already....\"  :/",
