   "message": "Oddly I am reminded of one of my favourite books, written by some guy, which I read once...well actually I scanned it looking for juicy bits.\n\nAt some point we find our hero walking through a massage parlour as he pursued the stereotypical bad guy - and he stops for a happy ending.  Loosely paraphrased the dialogue reads, \"She was making a little effort now, but he stopped at exactly the wrong moment and it fizzled out like a damp puncture.\"  I sure loved that book.",
