   "message": "That's all you've got?  Every day, in every forum, no one can resist inserting bullshit into otherwise serious conversations.  And yet, when presented with a forum to get it all out in the open once and for all, you freeze at a miserable 660 comments.  If that's all you've got we can move on.  But you'd better be sure this is all the bullshit you have to offer.\n\nThere will be special considerations offered to those who can't stay on topic elsewhere.  So you'd better dig deep and produce something.  I'd like to see this thread past 1000 comments - I know you have it in you.  Speak now or forever hold your parts.",
