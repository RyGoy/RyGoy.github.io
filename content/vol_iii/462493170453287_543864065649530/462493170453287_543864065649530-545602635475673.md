   "message": "i've said this before, TFL has been a huge psychology lesson for me first & foremost. When we look down through the page we can see whats wrong #1. FACTS dont change our minds. we are given a fact, the posts/questions that follow is \"US/WE\" attempting to rationalise those facts with our beliefs, in many cases the fact is contrary to our belief (cognitive dissonance) & so we end up externalising the Horseshit (we use this term as opposed to bullshit sometimes) .... all over the page . As regards the acknowledged barrier of stupidity/idiocy/language/locality... thats there for us all, so effort should be made to talk like you are talking to a fuckin tourist :p i have a beaten path outside my home where neighbours glare at me pacing up & down like a lunatic, thats all thats wrong with me, i cannot accept the facts & so i struggle, when my mind is capable of just realising facts for what they are everything else, EVERYTHING, will become easier... clearer...just procedural.until then I struggle, Its fair to say that if we were a little more internalised about our struggle, the threads would clean themselves.. maybe?",
