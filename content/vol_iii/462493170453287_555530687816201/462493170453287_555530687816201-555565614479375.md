   "message": "I am thinking it is one of those \"corporate administrative courts\" maybe posing as a legit court(if there are any of those) and was wondering how a \"small claims\" court issues warrants. This would be a \"lesser court\". From what I understand lesser courts, small claims courts don't issue warrants(they issue default judgements) for smack downs for$100 with 3 officers from 2 differant agencies(they did say we known to hang out with \"those\" freemen-on-the-land.) And send out 4-6 more. But hey it's Canada, what do I know..",
