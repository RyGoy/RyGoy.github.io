   "message": "Just had a couple of questions if someone could answer. I have been to court on the state side of the corperate border and all the courts I have been in have flags, your paperwork is stamped and signed by the clerk and every signature has the capacity of the person signing.\n My partner went to Provicial Court of British Columbia, (small Claims Court) and is signed \"by the Court\" (that is how it's signed, no seal, no Clerk of Court, no capacity of the person signing, They won't identify or clarify signature. So what kind of court is this..(yes I know Kangaroo, but seriously.??) Is this typical canada court or just Vancouver Island court of blatant money collecting here in Canada. So do we look up who chartered it/how.(any by the way if you don't go they send thugs with real guns)",
