   "message": "Beverly Girl-Brain Braaksma - I've had limited success with that approach. On a number of occasions I've been told that cheque cashing privileges are for members only. When I retorted with a member has an account here because they want me to get paid, to which I added, \"should I inform your client that his bank won't honour his cheques and are rendering the cheque not worth the paper it is written on?\", I've been told to \"go ahead\". They said they will inform the member that they were \"protecting\" them \"because the couldn't validate \"my\" ID was authentic\". Then they go on, \"But, if you want to start an account and deposit the cheque, we could then give you the funds via a withdrawal\". Of course, I asked them why my ID was considered possibly forged if I just want to cash a cheque, however, if I am willing to start an account, the very same ID will immediately and magically be accepted as valid. The response at getting caught in this lie usually results in something along the lines of \"I've spent enough time on this. Do you want to start an account or not?\"",
