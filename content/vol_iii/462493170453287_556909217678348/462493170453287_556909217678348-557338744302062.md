   "message": "Your 3 letters, notice, fault, default is your lien/claim in the private if done correctly. Case closed. You can sit on it defensively or offensively have it enforced in the public if it contains a counter claim, damages/fraud ect. If they take you to court you just sit on that claim and petition for dismissal. If your claim consists of a counter claim then you can file a case as plaintiff to collect or sell it to another interested party as a security and they can collect.\n\nSo Gail the only immediate  problem you have right now is to stop access to your funds.",
