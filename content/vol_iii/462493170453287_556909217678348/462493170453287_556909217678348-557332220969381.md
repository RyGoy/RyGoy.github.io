   "message": "Gail Blackman: great thanks....the response after the summary judgement I received from their lawyer, do I need to respond to it...he basically said no we dont see it as you do and you owe us still?\n\nYou could write and say that the lawyer's response is of 'no consequence' because it has not factually addressed the questions/concerns/counterclaims you have outlined in your default and is therefore of 'no force or effect'...Does the lawyer have first hand knowledge of the facts?  etc",
