   "message": "so the king in 1922 was the settlor(also trustee, the state is also the trustee/same PERSON, we the benficiaries, who haven't formally appointed administrators & so fiduciary duty on the trustee forces them to act, that exact trust is still in place today & why queenie was \"FORCED\" to inspect?, so by setting up private trusts & operating through them we gain equal footing with the state? the first trust evolved from taking control of nobles castles in england all the way up to entire countries but this was all done from the perspective of the first trust, meaning they always are acting in our interest under LAW, however they can rely on our ignorance to allow them full benefit of ourselves & resources in the meantime ..... or am i way off bat here??",
