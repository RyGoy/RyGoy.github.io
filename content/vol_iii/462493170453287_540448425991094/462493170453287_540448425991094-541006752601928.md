   "message": "the 1922 constitution \"included an oath to the king\".... The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created which would be the constitution. Although the Oath doesn't appear in the 1937 constitution, it didn't need to be because nothing effected the terms of the first & only trust... it was merely window dressing? the trust is their intelectual property & so the creation of a trust must be done in the same manner... by swearing an oath? i'm sorry for this but its neccesary for me to understand because the suggestion of that oath has caused me mental consternation, i'm being a victim of irish history books i know.",
