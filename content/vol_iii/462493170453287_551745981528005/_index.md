   "message": "Inspired by the recent stories of offers to contract some members have had recently, I thought it may be worth while creating a double sided card that I can hand out to public servants who invite me to contract with them, when I'm not interested.\n\n I'm not exactly sure how to technically create and print them yet, but thought others others may appreciate the idea. If can offer some technical assistance to me to, it would be much appreciated. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153195083450078&set=a.10153195083250078.1073741830.867445077&type=1&theater",
