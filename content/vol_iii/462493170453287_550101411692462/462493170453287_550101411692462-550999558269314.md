   "message": "Chris, I didn't want to hop in again, but I guess I'm having a Pete Daoust  moment (lol, hello Pete!). \n\nDon't get blinded by the flashing lights! It's all about surety and accounting. EVERYTHING ELSE is CLUBHOUSE RULES, and it WILL distract you. We were trained/programed to do so. What does it matter if someone described YOU as a SC (besides, not a SC, but SIMILAR to a SC, read well!)? Don't get distracted!\n\nAnything other than SURETY and ACCOUNTING IS A DISTRACTION! It doesn't matter that is a \"criminal\", or civil, complaint, fake injured party, or not, etc. Go to the ROOT of the dilemma, SURETY  and ACCOUNTING!\n\nRe-read Scott's advice on this subject. DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYBODY ELSE. There is NOBODY in this group qualified to advice YOU, other than SCOTT. We can all \"try\" to give our opinions hoping to help, but, who better than Scott? \n\nScott liked my comment, but it's because I just repeated what he had advised here at TTFL. \n\nDon't listen to the \"white noise\" around YOU, and listen to Admiral Scott's sweet cluster-fucking melodies! :D\n\n<<Scott Duncan: <<Here is my court room position in a nutshell. \n\nYou do not accept surety � EVER. \n\nStep 1: Reserve all rights. (get Derek Moran to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)\n\nStep 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed. Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS. If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. \n\nAnything outside of this supports their position that you are �playing� their game, and thus it is presumed that you understand the rules. The only way to counter this is to declare that you CANNOT UNDERSTAND the rules without these questions being answered.\n\nThink very carefully about this. If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling\nand its rules, you might raise the obvious question, �Why do you get to move two pieces?� If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?\n\nIf you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that's when you're going to �understand� that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game. You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert.\n\nNovice drivers and expert drivers all have to follow the same rules. You don't get to ignore rules because you suck at them. Just as my chess board is not a chess school, the court will not allow the presumption that you being a novice is a lawful excuse. The only method to extract yourself �with honour� is to accept responsibility for the mistake in presumption. They are presuming something wrong...and you are acknowledging it's your fault. The court must accept this MISTAKE, and your entreaty for forgiveness for the unintended debt created. The court MUST do this. \n\nYour name should never come into it. Your name is but a piece of evidence in a much larger presumption that the court has the right to attach a name derived from a public document, to a living man. This, of course, is untrue. The court knows it's not their right. That's why in the Mary Croft days, the quote �living man� argument worked. But these are trimming at the branches of the poisonous tree in an attempt to make it look pretty. The only solution is to target the root. The root is accounting and surety; there's no farther to dig down.>>",
