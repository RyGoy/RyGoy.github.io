   "message": "Thanks Max.  Oh, I feel no guilt!!  I only understand WHY this happened!\n\nI def pussied out!  I did sign the Recog document \"under duress VOID <autograph>\", but didn't hold it, and signed a NEW one when produced the way I was instructed.  That was dumb.  I won't pussy out again now that I get it!  Learning is way different than practicing.\n\nThat is how I see it too...after going back and re reading the posts, I see how important VOID is.  I will be VOIDing the Recog document.  As far as the other shit I signed, it was ALL signed \"under protest and duress\", if I see it, VOID, if not, forgiveness.  \n\n\"If I and/or any documents bearing my signature/seal, have led the Court to believe that I am acting as SURETY for the LEGAL NAME in ANY matter, please forgive me.\"  - Scott said on a thread that it was not his signature it was the documents signature.  Should I refer to it as mine? or \"any documents bearing a signature that appears to resemble mine\"  or something to that affect?",
