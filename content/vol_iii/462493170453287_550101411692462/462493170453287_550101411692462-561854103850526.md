BoE is day to day business, I don't act as surety when I discharge debts for PIERRE DAOUST, I act as an administrator for PIERRE DAOUST, I send the BoE where the surety is.....Because when They've created that person, I haven't signed FUCK-ALL, I was too young :D, so the government has to be surety for that person, They sure want me to be, but I can refuse to be, or accept to be....and I can decide this each day of my LIFE.....unless someone wants to say otherwise in writing and sign the document :D",
