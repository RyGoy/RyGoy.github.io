   "message": "Maybe im  just a smartass like that- but if it were me, i would file an Affidavit into the court saying just that:\n\nAFFIDAVIT\n\n1. The Judge was kind enough to help me out by entering a plea of \"not guilty\" and accepting to be the SURETY in this matter for me going forward.\n\n..an Affidavit is ultimately a 'Statement of Facts' - would you be lying, did YOU enter the plea Chris??\n\nSincerely,\nIMPLIED CONDUCT and/or ChiefRock Sino General just LOVES this term! ;)",
