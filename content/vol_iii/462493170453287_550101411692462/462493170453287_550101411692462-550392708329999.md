   "message": "Scott Duncan: JUST DON'T GIVE YOUR NAME. \"They can't keep you THAT long... because somebody has to PAY for it.\" At what point does this (if ever) become untrue? For example, can someone who has (or is suspected of having) assassinated the Prime Minister, raped, murdered, robbed a bank, hit and run (a child), a pedophile etc. really expect to be set free in a matter of time if they don't give their name? Forgive me Scott. I just can't see the government setting some people free just because they don't provide their name/signature. Signed...Confused and Curious with Bleeding Shins.",
