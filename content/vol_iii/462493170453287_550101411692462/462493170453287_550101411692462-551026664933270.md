   "message": "To Derek Moran and those interested:            I just got back from a late lunch, and, apparently I'm in big big trouble. \n\nOther than UNINTENTIONALLY and ACCIDENTALLY writing \"Chad\" instead of �Chris� in a couple of posts above, which I have since corrected, I am at a loss as to what I may have done so egregiously  wrong to be on the verge of being banned. \n\nAlthough I do realize that by accidentally interchanging those two names, I may have caused some confusion for a few minutes, and for that I truly apologize, I was (attempting to) answer �Chris� in response to his dilemma, and was thinking of a comment that �Chad� had recently made which I wanted to keep in mind for a subsequent post which I wanted to make. \n\nI would humbly ask everyone that I may have offended as a result of that confusion, to understand that there was absolutely no harm intended. It was an entirely HONEST MISTAKE. \n\nIf I have done anything else, other than occasionally adding my signature as \"Bleeding Shins\" - which (FYI) is as much an occasional personal reminder to me about how negligently I ran my commercial affairs prior to coming here, as it is an homage to Scott and his �liking� of my response posts to his inquiry if we are kicking ourselves for thinking wrong and valuing the wrong things, please let me know.\n\nHere again, I meant no offence, and, I will stop the occasional use of this �signature� henceforth. Please understand that in the context of witnessing several dozen (probably many many more) posts include the moniker (no offence Pete, I like your nicknames) Fucks the Puppy etc., amongst others; I had no idea that including a nickname was such an unstable and potentially explosive act bringing one dangerously close to deserving banishment. I truly was just having some fun with it. As I said, I won�t do it again.\n\n RE:\nDerek Moran In light of just how fond Scott Duncan is of Chad's critical-thinking-abilities (just ask him) i instead hand down the following ruling:\n\n*Justice to Robert Cormier*\n\nHere I�ll need your help as well in ending my confusion Derek. Presently, I have absolutely no idea what this reference means, nor do understand how Scott�s opinion of Chad could cause me to get banned. . \n\nI�ll ask for forgiveness for my confusion in this regard, as I have not kept track of Scott�s opinion of �Chad's critical-thinking-abilities�, nor was I aware that I was supposed to. I�ll certainly be more focused on  Scott�s opinion of �Chad's critical-thinking-abilities�, and, my very next post will be a request from me to Scott that he provide me (us) with his opinion of �Chad's critical-thinking-abilities�. \n\nI certainly don't want to be banned Derek. Once again, I�m here to end confusion and get answers that are helpful. Your guidance and help are always appreciated! :)\n\nThanks for your patience while I am �growing�.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert Cormier",
