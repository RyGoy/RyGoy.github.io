   "message": "NOBODY has the right to dictate how you sign ANYTHING. If they \"put you in a cage\", just sit there. Don't contract with them; \"Under Protest and Duress\" or otherwise. Have you learned NOTHING from Dean Clifford?\n\nThere is no \"co-operating a little\". Stand your ground. They lock you in a cage? Do Push-ups. Plan an invasion. Design a mobile network... JUST DON'T GIVE YOUR NAME. They can't keep you THAT long... because somebody has to PAY for it. This shit ain't free. There are accounts involved. The bar is pretty low for consent, so MAKE SURE you make the CREATION of the account, impossible.",
