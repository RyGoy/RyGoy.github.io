   "message": "Pete Daoust gave me the contact to get my live birth record in Quebec, just haven't gotten around to it yet. Chad Brodgesell I was never in possession of my birth certificate, because it was never issued. In the '60s in Quebec you got baptised along with getting your birth certificate. My mother was an atheist and so all I ever had I think was my live birth record. The RCMP stole all of my personal records and wouldn't return them, so I went and applied to Quebec vital statics for new documents. They told me that I needed my baptismal certificate to get my birth certificate and I could pay another $120.00 to get a birth certificate issued. They couldn�t find where a birth certificate had ever been issued for me. Told them I didn't have such a baptismal certificate, and never did. That all I really wanted was my live birth record. They told me that document was property of the hospital that I was born at. So I said ok tell me what hospital I was born at and I will get it myself. They said they couldn't do that and hung up. So now I have nothing. When I went to school, I started in Germany and I don't know what my mother did there to get me in. And once we moved to the states I got a green card, and again I don't know what my mother did there. I don't remember what info I used to get my driver�s license in the states but once we moved back to Canada I just traded my old driver�s license for one in Calgary.",
