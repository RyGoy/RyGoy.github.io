   "message": "Eamonn O Brien, Re licences etc.  I have struggled with this issue of acting through the person while learning how to better defend myself in 'legal land'.  \n\nIt is a mistake to use these documents as they are not mine.  However, the guy at the side of the road holding a gun, a big stick and a shiny badge probably doesn't comprehend that he is not king dingaling & I'm not his bitch (nor are my loved ones who may be with me at the time)\n\nIn my experience to date, it is sometimes more prudent to just do as the crazy man with the gun says (under duress or as Authorised Representative) & then correct the mistake administratively later.  \n\nAs I get better at dealing with these people, then my approach will evolve as well",
