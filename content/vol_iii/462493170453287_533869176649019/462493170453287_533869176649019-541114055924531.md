   "message": "I had gone yesterday as well and voided the locate and detain order, and I sent it back by registered mail to the court house. They should have gotten it today. The cops wont come to the house, but instead are going around to the kids' friends homes and scaring the crap out of the parents. Of all things they have told the boyfriend's family that we are into some really bad shit and they're (cops) scared to go there because its dangerous. Now anybody with half a brain would internalize this and say well, if the kid was there and the cops wont go there to detain her, how is that in her best interest? They would leave a kid in a situation that the cops know is bad and not go and rescue her because they are scared to go to a place that is dangerous. What the hell. They wont come here cause they know that I have voided the order and I now what is going on and they would have a hard time taking her. Plus I have a camera set up in the front window.",
