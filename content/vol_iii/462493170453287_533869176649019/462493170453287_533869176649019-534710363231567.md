   "message": "OK�.just to get it straight, \n\nI receive in MY mailbox a bill of exchange (Lettre de change in French)\nThis thing is addressed to PIERRE DAOUST\n\nI am the Lawful Holder of this thing called PIERRE DAOUST\n\nSo I have a duty of ASKING these guys who sent me this thing, on what to do with this thing\n\nAnd, as per the Bill of Exchange act, these guys have a duty to DISCLOSE all the remittance methods available for me to deal this matter.\n\nOr, maybe I can just re-direct, through Canada Post registered mail, this thing to its owner, which in my case, is Le gouvernement du Quebec ? ( I got this thought after Scott Duncan mentioned something about a nuke being delivered to my person by MISTAKE :/ )\n\nShall I include a Notice of Waiver if I decide to re-direct the thing to its owner ?\n\nI�m in a process of using the option no. 1 \nwith a specific Bill of Exchange received from Hydro-Quebec, and addressed to PIERRE DAOUST. I have sent my 3rd REQUESTS yesterday, and they keep the silence so far�.It�s been one complete year and NOTHING happened so far, they just keep sending me these bill of exchange, the last one I received was a $3600.00 appx bill of exchange. And, according to them, I have until July the 15th to take care of it, but since they don�t answer me, I can�t take care of it�.. :(",
