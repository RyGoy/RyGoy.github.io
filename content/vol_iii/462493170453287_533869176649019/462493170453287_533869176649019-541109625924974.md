   "message": "I'm thinking that you have something there Chad Brodgesell, cause I went into the court house yesterday and requested a true certified copy of the original order that I had voided (they say tampered with). They kept insisting that they give me a previously photocopied one and wanted to certify it as a true original copy. I told them no, I wanted a true certified original copy. Well the clerk said that she went through it and it is a mirror copy of the original. I said no. So I'm thinking that the reason why they don't want to give me the true certified original is because it is no longer valid, and they are not wanting to admit it. Trying to drag this out for as long as possible and hopefully I don't know what I have really done. Next time I go to family court I'm definitely going to have to challenge the validity of that document.",
