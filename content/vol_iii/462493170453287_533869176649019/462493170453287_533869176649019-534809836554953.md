   "message": "But the order was already made, and i was served with it. It would already be executed but i am probably wrong on this.\n\nThere is really no where to sign in, you go to the court clerk(with your number) and ask to see your case file. IT then have everything. The actual orders they must retrieve a special file for it, but they will not give it to me.\n\nthis order has been in effect since september, restraining order(if the same for voiding) is not present or that is what the clerk said.",
