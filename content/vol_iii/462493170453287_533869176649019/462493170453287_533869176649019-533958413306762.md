   "message": "The licence one is a hard one for me at present as i need it and am not qualified to drive not using it yet. I also have to take into consideration the fact i cannot be getting pulled out of it every and having it impounded daily as i am somebodies full time carer and spend allot of time back and forward to hospitals with him so my car is up to date and it's the only interaction i have with them. I have yet to be in court over any driving except no insurance but as i did have it the  case was thrown out. Thats the thing i don't mind paying insurance if it's my choice to do so, i am not looking for a way to live for free and get out of paying my bills with all this i just simply cannot be a slave to them for no other reason than i will not live my life on my knees for any man.",
