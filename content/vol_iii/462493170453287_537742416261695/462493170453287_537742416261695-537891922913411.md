   "message": "The collection agency KNOWINGLY bought a \"Bill of goods\" to victimize the gullible parties.\n\nGiving your name and address is enough for them to PRESUME joinder. They THEORETICALLY could lay a claim based on this. If they send it by registered mail. \n\nSending it back registered mail (RETURN EVERYTHING THEY SENT WITH A NOTICE OF MISTAKE) will kill it dead right there.\n\nWatch what you say on phone calls. Shit like \"we just need to confirm your address... What is your address\"?",
