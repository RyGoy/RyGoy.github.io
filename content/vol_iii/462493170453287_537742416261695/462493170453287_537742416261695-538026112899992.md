Here it goes: ChiefRock recently told me to put my Address on registered mail, but, instead of adding the last line (postal code) he told me to write: Non Domestic without Canada. Here's my questions: Did Chief Rock make a mistake instructing me to do this? Is this a valid option? Have we been misinformed?",
