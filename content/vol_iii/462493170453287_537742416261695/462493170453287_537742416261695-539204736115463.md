   "message": "ok.....so Hydro-Quebec sends you a Bill of Exchange.  So, if they presented it to you, THEY are the Drawer, correct?  They are thinking you are the Drawee, yes?  Who then is the Payee?  You as the Drawee say \"Yes, it would be my pleasure to pay this third party (who is....?) on demand or at a future date, but how would you like me to do this?\"\n\nDo I have this correct?  When you received the Bill of Exchange, how were you able to identify it as a BoE and not as a Bill for Account or Services (etc) or an Invoice?",
