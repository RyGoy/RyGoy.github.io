   "message": "Brauns Orig Libau T?lis, I would love to pay if they can substantiate their claim...after all I'm honourable and acting in good faith, so IF they 'claim' they were assigned the debt, THEN they must have the original document, in its' original form, signed by me.\n\nI asked one of these collection companies for confirmation that if they had purchased the debt in question, they would have the original contract in their possession...otherwise that could be construed as fraud, coercion & harassment.\n\nThey said they were not proceeding with any claim until they investigated and could confirm that for me...that was more than two years ago, closer to 4, I stopped waiting for their confirmation.",
