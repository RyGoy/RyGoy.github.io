Time to shut up now.\n\nTO REVIEW:\n\nNO COLLECTION AGENCY DOES, and NOR CAN THEY DO, ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:\n\n1: Report ANYTHING to a CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY - Anything they reported would be FRAUD, as there's NO FUCKING CONTRACT\n\n2: FILE LEGAL CLAIMS - AGAIN, NO FUCKING CONTRACT. Did you receive a BENEFIT from them? Are they an INJURED PARTY?\n\nSeriously. Stop making shit up. The REAL stuff is hard enough, with out having to clean up YOUR made-up shit!",
