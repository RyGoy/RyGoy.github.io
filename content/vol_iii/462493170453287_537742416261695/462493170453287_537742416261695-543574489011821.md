   "message": "Living on a lighted stage\nApproaches the unreal\nFor those who think and feel\nIn touch with some reality\nBeyond the gilded cage.\n\nCast in this unlikely role,\nIll-equipped to act,\nWith insufficient tact,\nOne must put up barriers\nTo keep oneself intact.\n\nLiving in the Limelight,\nThe universal dream\nFor those who wish to seem.\nThose who wish to be\nMust put aside the alienation,\nGet on with the fascination,\nThe real relation,\nThe underlying theme.\n\nLiving in a fisheye lens,\nCaught in the camera eye.\nI have no heart to lie,\nI can't pretend a stranger\nIs a long-awaited friend.\n\nAll the world's indeed a stage,\nAnd we are merely players,\nPerformers and portrayers,\nEach another's audience\nOutside the gilded cage.",
