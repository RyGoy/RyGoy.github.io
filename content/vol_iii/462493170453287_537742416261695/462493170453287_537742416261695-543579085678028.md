   "message": "My advice to ...well.. any one who wants to hear it is,\nRead Black's Law 4th or 5th edition. Just skim it. Some words will jump out, focus on those and each word in the definition. Then go on to the next. Over and over again.\nMake the one dictionary (which ever you pick) the only book you read for 2 months at least.\nSpend every waking moment not involved with the life and family reading that one book.\nAfter that you will naturally gravitate to other documents yadda yadda.",
