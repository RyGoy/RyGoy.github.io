   "message": "Here in the States, using a postal code is acquiescence to the Federal Jurisdiction.  It is prima facie evidence that YOU have claimed DOMICILE in DC and are RESIDING in another State. I have sent thousands of pieces exactly like this:\n\nJohn Doe\n123 Main Street\nPeabody, Massachusetts\n\nSome guys use [ ] around the Zip Code or write \"Near\", but it is not necessary.  They way I write it is de jure and compliant with current Postage Regulation.  ALL MY MAIL GETS WHERE I WANT IT TO!",
