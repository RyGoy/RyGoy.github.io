   "message": "The only problem with taking it out of the Public trust is that it harms others by increasing public (government) debt, which your fellow man pays for...even though this is the way we are instructed to do it via the B of E Act (at least in Australia, the instruction is to send it via the state treasury).\n\nMy understanding is that if it gets sent to the central bank (who creates the currency in the first place, they can discharge it at their end, or make the necessary deposit on our behalf...which is why people with a greater comprehension than me have done it this way.\n\nEither way, more debt is created, which ultimately burdens and or enslaves us further, which leaves us in a Catch 22 because until we can get everyone out of this debt based system, ultimately someone 'innocent' ends up harmed by our actions.",
