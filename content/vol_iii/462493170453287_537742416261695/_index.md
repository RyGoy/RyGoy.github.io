   "message": "I'm working on discharging some debt. I was wondering if someone, who has been successful in doing so, would be willing to look over what I have completed to send to the bank and see if I'm on the right track. Also, if there is anyone who has been successful in discharging debt when there is a co-signer involved. I'm not to clear if the processes are the same - discharging debt vs. involvement of co-signer (hope that make sense)?\n\nAny insight and direction would be much appreciated. Thank you. \n\nAdmin - Scott - hope this is alright if I post this.",
