   "message": "Ok....I just read my Electricity Agreement.  I signed this 7 years ago and haven't thought of it since.  I identified myself with an SSN.  This would mean I identified myself as a \"corporate fiction\".  Thereby, I would be required to pay them.  Looks like I need to change this contract and let them know I have no duty to provide them with this number pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974.  More fun!!!!!!",
