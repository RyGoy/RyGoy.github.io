   "message": "And why the FUCKING  National Assembly of Quebec have a PRESIDENT ?\n\nThe National Assembly of Quebec (French: Assembl�e nationale du Qu�bec) is the legislative body of the Province of Quebec. Legislators are called MNAs (Members of the National Assembly; French: d�put�s). The Lieutenant Governor and the National Assembly compose the Parliament of Quebec, which operates in a fashion similar to those of other British-style parliamentary systems.\n\nThe National Assembly was formerly the lower house of Quebec's legislature and was then called the Legislative Assembly of Quebec. In 1968, the upper house, the Legislative Council, was abolished and the remaining house was renamed.\n\nThe current President of the National Assembly (equivalent to \"speaker\" in other legislatures) is Liberal MNA Jacques Chagnon.",
