   "message": "\"science of astrotheology\"?\n\nSeriously, fuck off with that shit, Santos. Learn what SCIENCE IS before you use the word. The thing about SCIENCE is that you can ALWAYS reproduce the results.\n\nWhen someone says \"it's not an exact science\" read it as: \"it's NOT SCIENCE\".\n\nCan I shit on your next meal  and claim it's good for you to eat because it STILL has the same nutritional value? Will you be able to remove all my shit from your meal, and clam it's \"just as good\"?",
