   "message": "I have been here little more than a week. I've been aware for quite a while that for every enactment there is remedy and relief. The way I see it now is there is remedy in commerce and relief for the man. I have been solely focused on the human rights aspect, relief from Crown servitude, in that regard I gained standing as an individual. I've yet to manage the return of my property. I see now it will be through the tender for law.\n\nSo...\nGrantor creates trust, Title,Bla bla bla, your momma. Held in the trust is my trusty my property, SOB, the International Bill (called a bill for a reason) of Rights. Uncontested claim of right and Court Ruling for the man as competent individual. (Prothonotary noted, \"as for the plaintiff being an Individual and self represented, the motion is Granted, AT NO COST). \nMan creates Corporation, title, , charter the Corporation to hold the trust. The Corporate By Laws are to increase the value of the trust and pay the dividends to the shareholder. 100,000 shares 1 share holder.\n\nAs a birthright I pocess a name and am beneficiary of said name.\nThe minister of industry by default is the registrar general, yet the deputy dog ontario registrar provides surety via a mechanically reproduced signature on Certificated paper that it is held by the registrar. \n\n\"Foundation Document\"\n\nThe birth certificate is the negotiable instrument, insofar as the Bank of Canada issued it through the treasury for a public purpose.\n\nSo birthright, grantor of the living trust, liens negotiable instrument via the corporation for say a 100,000,000.\n\nAny time the name is used without prior written consent value should flow to the trust via the Corporation (first in line) in the form of set off, damages and or tender. All by public notice\n\nThink I just burn a bulb, good thing I have no faith, I'll be back to seek answers in the light of truth.",
