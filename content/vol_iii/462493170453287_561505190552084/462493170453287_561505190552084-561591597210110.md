   "message": "I don't get into maybes myself; only interested in fact surrounding how I need to go about getting the fucking crown to return to me what they STOLE from me! This is why I asked if anyone was privy to who this Marcus is and if his info is valid etc etc. Being almost 38 years in this manifestation; I am no longer interested in chasing my tail; body getting tired, and mind feeling frustrated with all the BS out there. I will reinforce Gail Blackman's question though; Has anyone here seen the unravelling programs? Or better yet, has some insight as to how to go about reversing this clusterfuck of assumed identity fraud? ;)",
