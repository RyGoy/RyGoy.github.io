   "message": "I found you through Dallas Hills, who put me on to the Servant King website: http://www.servantking.info/ quite informative to say the least; but has me curious as to whether there is any value in what this \"Marcus\" is talking about in his videos. He gives access to his \"Confusion Programs\" videos that discuss the idea that we own nothing and are \"impersonating\" a created identity to keep us from our real birthright, and then goes on to say that he will show how to correctly reclaim our birthrights through his \"unravelled programs\"; but will only give out the unravelled programs to those who contact him with regards to interest in them and intent to follow them through. I am curious as to whether or not anyone here has seen these \"unravelled programs\" and if they are valid; or just an utter waste of time.",
