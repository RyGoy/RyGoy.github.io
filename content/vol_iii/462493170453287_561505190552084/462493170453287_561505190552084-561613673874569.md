   "message": "Read this Matthew Barton Stoddard, and tell me what you think :D\n\nBill of Exchange.\nHere�s HOW I do it, and WHY�..\n\nThe first step is definitely to open the mailbox, now, that mailbox is not even MY mailbox if I really THINK about it, it�s the person named PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX is mailbox, I just happen to be the SOLE authorized ADMINISTRATOR for this person right ?\n\nSo, as a good administrator, I have the key for this mailbox, and I go there EVERYDAY, and I am so excited to do this now, , a year ago this stupid mailbox scared me so much, that my heart beat use to accelerate when I finally had the guts to go in there.\n\nAnyway, I open the mailbox, and HA HA�!!!!.....a bill of exchange is in it \n\nNow, this Bill of Exchange is addressed to the person I happen to be the SOLE authorized administrator�.it is addressed to PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX, so, as the SOLE authorized administrator, I have to open that envelop and TAKE CARE of that matter.\n\nSo let say the City of Montreal sent to PIERRE DAOUST this bill of exchange, and it says on it $295.00, now, WHO owe $295 to the City of Montreal ?, yes, it�s PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX.\n\nNow, what do I do with this, mmhhh, �..I see 2 choices.\n\n1). I can, yes �ME�, I can buy back this debt, and use some Bank Notes and go to the post office to buy a money-order and send it to the City of Montreal, and they will balance their book with this. I can NOT send the Bank Notes (cash) to them, they won�t ACCEPT it, I wonder WHY ? \n\n2). I can DISCHARGE this debt for PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX, because the truth is that this bill of exchange has been commenced by the City of Montreal for PIERRE DAOUST, because they ASSUME that PIERRE DAOUST is too ignorant to do it, so they commenced it��they are the BENEFICIARY party to this bill of exchange, and PIERRE DAOUST is the DRAWER party to this bill of exchange.\n\nNow, we are missing one party, because a bill of exchange has 3 parties, the BENEFICIARY, the DRAWER and the DRAWEE.\n\nWHO is the drawee for this bill of exchange ?.....I need to find where is the SURETY of this PERSON named PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX, and when I�ll find that, I will be able to KNOW who is the drawee.\n\nDrawee: The party on which an order for the payment of money is drawn.\nDrawer: One that draws, especially one that draws an order for the payment of money.\n\nI will NOT explaine this one in details, but I have very good reasons to believe that the drawee has to be The Bank of Canada, because the SURETY for PIERRE DAOUST is definitely the Government, since they have created PIERRE DAOUST, and on the CERTIFICATE that prove it creation, the signature is the government signature, so therefor, the SURETY, and since the Bank of Canada is the government�s bank, I am sure that the ORIGINAL certificate of PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX, is sitting in their building. So the DRAWEE is the Bank of Canada.\n\nSo, as one of the BEST sole authorized administrator in town, Here is HOW I do it.\n\nI turn this Bill of Exchange on the Private side (Back), and I take out my STAMPS \n\nThe first stamp says:\n\nACCEPTED BY:______________ (I sign there)\n\nThe 2nd stamps say: DATE\n\nThe third says: ACCOUNT NO. 26X-XXX-XXX or 119XXXXXXXXXXX\n\nAnd the fourth says: Bill of Exchange ACT (1985)\n\nI have good reasons to believe that this COMPLETE that bill of exchange and discharge the debt.\n\nI include a small one page letter with it giving EXPLAINATION on what I�m doing.\n\nI send the Bill of exchange COMPLETE to the bank of Canada registered mail, and one copy to the benefiary, in this case, City of Montreal, to make sure they KNOW I have done my duty",
