   "message": "I love my job, the people I work with, not so much. They call for the murder of arabs, they wish the first peoples of turtle island to be extinguished. I tell them the same should happen to them and their children and they get angry,  ask how I could say such a thing. I laugh and tell them to pay their taxes, eat Monsanto shit, tune in the telly and shut the fuck up slave. Needless to say they don't like me much. Like I said I love my union job, I can speak my mind and suffer no consequence other than  the cold shoulder and cowardly back talk. They like to pretend they do no wrong, fact is they are part and party to the crimes being perpetrated against humanity.",
