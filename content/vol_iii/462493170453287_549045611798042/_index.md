   "message": "i bought enterpriserentacarcanada.com in 2008 after they fucked me over on a rental cost me over $2000. I was planning to use the domain to board complaints and bad media about them and still am and even more so now after i received this letter.\n\nOn Aug 9, 2013, at 2:48 PM, Reuter, Renee M wrote:\n\nTo Whom it may concern,\n \nI note you have not responded to my previous request that you transfer the domain name, enterpriserentacarcanada.com.\n \nA copy of my previous request is referenced below for your perusal.\n \nYour prompt response and compliance is expected. \n \nSincerely,\n \nRenee Reuter\nFrom: Reuter, Renee M \nSent: Monday, July 22, 2013 4:29 PM\nTo: 'info@eyeaxis.com'\nSubject: enterpriserentacarcanada.com\n\nTo Whom it may concern,\n \nI represent Enterprise Holdings, Inc. (\"Enterprise\") on trademark issues.  It has recently come to my attention that you have registered and put to use the domain name,enterpriserentacarcanada.com,  which incorporates several of the family of trademarks owned by Enterprise without authorization (the �Domain Name�). \n \nIn addition, marks identical or confusingly similar to trademarks owned by Enterprise are used in metatags, text, hidden text and/or images on one or more of the websites.  These uses are likely to create consumer confusion by suggesting that you or your company is somehow affiliated with or sponsored by our famous Enterprise brand.\n \nFor decades, ENTERPRISE has been used as a service mark in connection with vehicle rental and leasing services, reservation services for the rental and leasing of vehicles, the sales of vehicles, and the repair of vehicles.  Enterprise owns U.S. Trademark Registration Nos. 1,343,167; 2,371,192; 3,548,422; 3,490,649; 3,479,308; 3,475,113; 3,581,022; and 3,547,336, EU Trademark Registration Nos. 5,647,987; 5,323,134; and 5,648,001.  By virtue of its well-established trademark rights in the U.S, E.U. and elsewhere, Enterprise enjoys the exclusive right to use the ENTERPRISE mark and related logo marks (�the Enterprise Marks�) in connection with these services, and others closely related.\n \nUse of the Enterprise Marks by you and your company in this way constitutes infringement of  Enterprise's federally registered service marks, as well as other violations of state and common law.\n \nEnterprise is committed to protecting its trademarks and enforcing its trademark rights against infringers as can be seen in various UDRP matters, including http://domains.adrforum.com/domains/decisions/1142637.htm.  However, Enterprise always strives to resolve these kinds of matters amicably and on a business basis between the parties.  We will consider the matter resolved if you promptly provide us with your written assurances that you and your company will immediately discontinue any and all use of marks owned by Enterprise in the Domain Name listed above, on websites and elsewhere, and take steps to transfer the Domain Name, and all other domain names in your possession that incorporate Enterprise Marks to Enterprise. \n \nPlease respond by   August 5, 2013  confirming that you agree to comply fully with the foregoing.  You may contact me by telephone 314-512-3234 with any questions.  I look forward to your timely response.\n \nSincerely,\n \nRenee Reuter\nCorporate Counsel - Intellectual Property\n314-512-3234 office\nrenee.m.reuter@ehi.com \n<image001.gif>\nOperating\n<image002.jpg>\nCorporate Headquarters\n600 Corporate Park Drive\nSt. Louis, MO 63105\nUSA\nenterpriseholdings.com\n \n<image003.jpg>\n \n\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This e-mail and any files transmitted with it are intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed and may contain confidential and privileged information protected by law.

They offered me 200 and cost me over 2000 what can i do to fight this off the domain is owned by me but held by Godaddy and i think they may favor Enterprise regardless of my rights.",
