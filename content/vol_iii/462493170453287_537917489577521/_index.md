   "message": "So I'm on probation. I found the office i report to once a month on Dun and Bradstreet so obviously they are for profit. I did sign a CONTRACT obviously. So could i send them a NOTICE OF MISTAKE? How might one withdraw from the contract without going to jail? Because the contract with probation and parole is what got me out of jail... Is this even possible? Seems like anything else just send the NOTICE...... It is a public debt I'm paying i suppose. How might one discharge that DEBT?",
