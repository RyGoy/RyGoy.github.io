   "message": "Lani Black wins in court - and tells ALL about how she did it . . . .a Tender For Law-EXCLUSIVE!\n\n\"Case dismissed.\n\nNo. I did not accept the offer of 'no fines, no court costs...in exchange for a sworn testimony of probable cause' either.\n\nCase was dismissed because there was no credibility on the part of the state. My request for the video recording was denied, and the state could not hold up their case against me.\n\nIt took my time though. Time that I cannot get back. Keep that in mind.\n\n I didn't have an opportunity to challenge jurisdiction. It was dismissed when I stepped up to the microphone....nothing to learn from me.\n\n The only question I ever posted was the one we discussed about a month ago...\"",
