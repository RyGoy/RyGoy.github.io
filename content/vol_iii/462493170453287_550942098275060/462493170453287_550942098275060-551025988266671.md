   "message": "ONLY a PERSON can be charged for breaking a red light, and this PERSON is presumed an EMPLOYEE of this city where it happens, so the EMPLOYEE (Person) have made an INFRACTION.....so the employee has to be PUNISHED for it....so they create an account for this EMPLOYEE (person) and collect the EMPLOYEE. If the employee plea guilty or not-guilty, the employee is confirming his employee status with this city.\n\nDoes that makes sense ? :/\n\nI am going through all this with the city of Montreal....I am almost there, I have sent a letter explaining all this to them, and I rebutt the fact that PIERRE DAOUST can be one of their EMPLOYEE....\n\nI have returned them the ticket saying NO CONTRACT on it......5 months later, they sent me a guilty plea, with a judgement....I sent them a letter asking WHO entered a plea on the person, and WHO decided to judge the person without inviting the person......they've sent me back a letter asking to call them :D\n\nI called them and recorded the call, the lady told me that a computer system entered a guilty plea, and a computer system entered a judgement :D",
