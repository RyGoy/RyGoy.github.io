   "message": "So Police start the complaint but where is the account created? Correct me if I'm wrong to do so but, I picture a company (Police) and it's accounting department. A cop goes to the accounting department and they create an account for \"PERSON\" and attach the debt to it... Am I right to picture it as such?",
