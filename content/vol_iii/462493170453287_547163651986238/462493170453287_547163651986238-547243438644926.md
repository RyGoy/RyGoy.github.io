   "message": "So if you're in a situation where you suspect you're being asked to accept surety by answering to the GIVEN NAME (which sounds exactly like the TAKEN NAME) would you then be wise to \n1. ask which NAME is being used? ...or\n2. just assume the intention is to make you surety and view this an offer to contract?\n(my fear of course was that the maxim could used against me by someone because the NAME they used on me was 'close enough' and the 'body was certain')",
