   "message": "Please learn how to pick your fights and do not make a fool of yourself and or others by trying to avoid responsibility. You are a truck driver operating commercially either as an employee or for hire. either way you are under contract to operate with a valid license, and operate under the rules of that license. If indeed as you state your log book was not up to date or was not filled in, do not make it harder on yourself than it already is. chances are it will be cheaper to just pay the ticket than try and fight it to get off. \n\nIf you win, you lose. If you do not represent the person, (driver license) then they suspend the license and you are out of a job. \n\nIf none of this applies to you please disregard. I was a truck driver for over 30 years and yes held a valid license up until march. the sole reason I held the license was because I was under contract and it was stipulated as a condition of employment. I am certain even if you are an Owner Operator your contracts for hire stipulate something to the effect you must be licensed and insured. \n\nScott Duncan please feel free to correct any errors of presumption I may have made thank you Sir.",
