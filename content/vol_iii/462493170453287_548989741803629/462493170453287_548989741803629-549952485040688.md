   "message": "if frizbey or any of the others owned their mistake so as the lesson could be continued i'm sure they would be back here now. He detests us all (very fair) equally, there are no favors other than the lesson, its not personal, SD has stood over Derek's decision so thats that, further conversation is only distraction. its in each individuals own interest what they do with their \"limited time\" here. This isn't the \"Bestest Friends Forever \" page. We have possibly 3 months left, settle down & get on with your work ;)",
