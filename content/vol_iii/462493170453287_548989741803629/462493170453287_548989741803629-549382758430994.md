   "message": "Probably not - I was just toying with you.  I do, however think that our collective obsession with \"political correctness\" is extremely damaging to our society.  \n\nThe fact that we give weight to words that are apparently emotionally traumatizing to members of a particular race, yadda, yadda, only serves to perpetuate the belief that some people should receive more deference than others because they're in the special needs category.  If we can't describe a black man as being black, for instance, we reinforce the impression being dark-skinned is something that shouldn't be recognised or acknowledged.  \n\nThis is not the language of equals.  The time we take attempting to not hurt the feelings of the marginalized allows us to succeed at maintaining the status quo.\n\n...my two cents anyway.  That doesn't mean it wasn't funny.",
