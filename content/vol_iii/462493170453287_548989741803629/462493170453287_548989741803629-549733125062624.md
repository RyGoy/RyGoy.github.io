   "message": "I asked to be part of Frisbey's group back in July.  \nThere was a chat associated with this group 'Star moon night', where we could all talk to each other, Fisbey, Adam, Jason, or any other of the 32 members. \nIt never really worked for me but I managed to get it up and invited Brenda.\nThen, we were ALL chatting (Andrew Langevin was there, also) and Derek Hill popped into the conversation.  \nGood thing Leblanc was there, because he seen some sneaky things going on. \nI thought I would call Hill out, with him being there, since I have not communicated with him since he was banned.  \nThat is MY side.",
