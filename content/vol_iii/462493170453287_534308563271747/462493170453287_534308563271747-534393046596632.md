   "message": "IIRC the hand held radars were proven inadmissible in court under appeal a few years ago for the very reasons suggested by you, AFAIK they cant gain a conviction & so rely on our unquestioning compliance, the figures then released by media as unpaid fines (slackers who wont pay their way) were those which were unenforceable.i distinctly remember reading about the appeal taken by a cork businessman who \"scored\" 12 points & got banned but cant find it now.",
