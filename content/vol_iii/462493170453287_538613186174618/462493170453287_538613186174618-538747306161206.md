   "message": "Mining data to gather which members break the law? A question which determines which members could police target and raid and likely be able to haul off to jail for possession or trafficking? Really? Sounds like a government troll question to me. I wonder which admin thought this question would be helpful to further the intent of TFL. hmmm Curiouser and curiouser. I just don't get this thread. How about, how many drive without license and insurance, or, much better yet, how many members sell crack from their home with their kids in the house? This might be a good question too to further the goals of TFL as well. There's a lot to learn (only if your a cop) with questions like these. Sign me: confused.",
