   "message": "Lots of people \"fit\" into lots of different categories.  Anyone who fits into the \"Borderline category\" is not someone I can deal with.  The lying, the fabricating, the \"fitting in\", the manipulating....it all leads to Borderline/Sociopathic behavior.  \n\nMy statement to DH when everyone embraced him was \"I never knew why everyone here fucked with him so much\".  Now I do....even Scott didn't want to deal with him, then changed when DH used the NoM.  But it looks like we were right about this guy and we changed.  What I think happened is he MANIPULATED reality and we bought in.....Classic Borderline trait!",
