( cop car pulls up behind at high speed gets my plate checked and then he went away.. after I asked the cop is this road open to crownsest pass?.)\n\n   Serenity is part of a separate trust but yet included as by being affiliated with...\n\n   Separate note... had the opportunity to actually have a conversation with a sheriff... she brought up profiling I questioned it... She actually held up her hand and said...\" Your a protester\"   To which I responded ... You brought up profiling I just questioned it.... \n\n\n\n\nPoint being is the sheriffs and such are indoctrinated in to not listening....\n\n\n\n\nScott Duncan is it my paranoia or does tech exist to manipulate weather and such to create a need for public safety?",
