   "message": "Now there is a severe thunderstorm warning for Kitchener/Waterloo. Much like Toronto's experience, we had flooding here last week as well. Now there is a flood warning again. 110km winds are predicted with hail 2 to 4 cms in diameter. 50mm of rain is expected to fall within an hour. It seems each larger city is taking turns being flooded.",
