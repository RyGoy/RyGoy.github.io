Half the people on here are story board warriors who don't even put their knowledge into practice, rather they sit back and declare what they \"Know\" through the computer screen. And Scott Duncan what's this shit about you being all up Queen Elizabeth's ass? That braud ain't done shit for me... while she's over there wear million dollar jewelry- that bitch aint done SHIT for me. So fuck her authority too.",
