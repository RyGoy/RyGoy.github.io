   "message": "I was just reviewing this thread and chanced upon the stylings of one \"Love Hubert\".  I was looking forward to engaging her in polite conversation, but as I continued I realized she had experienced a slight tingling sensation...and went off to pursue other opportunities.  \n\ni really hope this tirade was from some underendowed, middle-aged, bloated government worker, and not a sad testiment on our wide-eyed, optimistic youth.  \n\nBy the way...
