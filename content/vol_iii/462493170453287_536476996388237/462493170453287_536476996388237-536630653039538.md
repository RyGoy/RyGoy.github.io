SO counterproductive to the purpose of learning... ya'll learn so you can disrespect others and jack off at the computer screen feeling like you haven't completely failed in life... but like I said.. your life is almost over- just fucking get over it. I'm so sick of having to read through post after post after post of BULLSHIT hoping to find something useful to my journey. YOU\"RE MARRIED!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! lol..\nAnd you don't think theirs a God out there somewhere? haha..",
