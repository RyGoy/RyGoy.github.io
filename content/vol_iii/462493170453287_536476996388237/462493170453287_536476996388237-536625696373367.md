Some people call the mathematics and amazement and beauty behind that which is the \"Flower of Life\"  God... YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU can call it whatever the fuck you want, IIIIIII don't call it a mother fucking thing. We can't be so ignorant yet live under the presumptions that we are the \"elite of the smart'.  You guys are gonna die before the fun gets started anyway, so just keep teaching US... the younger generation who is not withering away right now so that we can actual enjoy this world",
