Bitcoin replaced all money and eliminated USURY in that process, trade is on a level playing field. Perhaps the closest REAL freetrade we could imagine.\n\nIt is a huge IF as there are way too many variables at play but mostly \"they\" will do whatever they can to eliminate it or control it. To do so gives advantage to \"them\" to continue to control us. If they can not control us, \"they\" elimination of us will be the next option.\n\nFurthermore, it is still a mystery of the designer of Bitcoin and it very well could be the masters who created it for the next series of scams.\n\nWe dont have enough information as of yet, but one can dream some wonderful BS.  :)",
