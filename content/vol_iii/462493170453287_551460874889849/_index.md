   "message": "Good evening/day beautiful folk, I am glad to be in your fold, thank you very much.  I hope that you and all your loved ones are in Great Spirit. I was wondering if I could please receive some assistance/pointers/ideas about a particular case I am presently dealing with.  I am here in Ontario, about five weeks ago we had a blackout in our city, I was at a major intersection helping to direct traffic for about 2 hours ( I am lucky there were hundreds of people witnessing this, so it is public record) a cop came to tell me that he would take over { & that I should go to another intersection} at the beginning of this (about 7pm), he didn't... 2 cars tried to run me over while helping (toward the very end of the 2 hrs.), I jumped on the hood of the second car to get out of the way, the people inside of the car attacked me while I was on top of their car asking what \"was wrong with them\", I threw punches back in defence, while I tried to get off the car.  I continued helping, about 10 mins. after the 2nd car incident the same cop came to tell me to get off the road, of course I complied, I went to retrieve my stuff, he began being belligerent toward me, calling me a nuisance, belittling me after I'd performed his job for 2 hrs or so.. I turned to the the about 10 people that were directly behind me for support, many of them had been video taping this throughout, asked them about his nuisance comment, they quickly in tandem told him that I was helping/being good/ to leave me alone.. this continued for a short while, I could not believe his imposing, outrageous attitude... being in awe by his insults and characterization, I told him that in our interaction I had been true to my word and that he was the one lying not only to me, but to the thousands of people that he refused to serve by directing traffic-- in my head thinking (I have been true to my word, I have testified true, this man is violent offensive and a liar, I'm done-- ... I testified by showing him my testes (the origin of the word), turned around showed him my butt & told him to suck on the left one (the people laughed)..  & I left peacefully walking my bike, not believing the amount of hate that man was giving out, when crossing the second intersection, cruisers surrounded me, he came out of the corner where we were speaking/arguing, he pointed at me and said \"you're going in\".. I said \" for what?\" he repeated it, I asked him again for what, he did not respond, at this point cops start grabbing at me, the people on the south/east corner that were supporting me raised their hands as a group & screamed to stop.. I screamed for them to help me & ran toward them, for aid & mediation, I hid behind them momentarily, they broke through them I realized my presence there put them in danger, as the cops just smashed through them.  So I decided to take off from there running, I got about a 75 meters away with them well behind me, but I realized my running was a moot point & that my best bet was to have witnesses.  I returned toward the same intersection running on the sidewalk, when I got close to the intersection they started beating on me, they had me under control, they threw me on to the street, cuffed me and proceeded to beat and pound on my body ( I am 5 '4, 135 lbs.), I had about 8 of them on my body, they tried to make me stop breathing, by pressuring on my chest, I asked to please stop, that I was not resisting, I was peaceful, but they smelled blood, so they continued... I gained a few broken ribs from this, a punctured and collapsed lung.. as well as 7 charges: 2 cops assaults, 2 assaults on the people that attacked me with their car and their fists, they lie/claim I broke their windshield,  1 property under 5000, public intoxication/ & disturbance.... there is multiple video and witnesses corroborating my story/ hundreds of witnesses in fact, there is medical record of the injuries sustained.. they refused me medical treatment, when I told them several times that I had broken ribs.  I am a free man on the land (since 2005) I have continually identified myself to them as such.. by stating my name as I am commonly known as so & so of the, so & so family/clan.  The step I'm at is awaiting their second disclosure date.. & it is time for me to start affirming to them that they've got the wrong guy in the wrong court, challenging their jurisdiction, any help is much appreciated, here on the board so we all learn, or as aprivate message,  thank you all so much beeautiful people.
