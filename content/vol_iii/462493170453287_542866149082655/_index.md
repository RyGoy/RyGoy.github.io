   "message": "Dean Clifford on the ONLY way he would ever CONTRACT with HER MAJESTY these days- thread.....\n\n*Ben Lowrey to Dean Clifford* \"You mean Her Majesty and HER MAJESTY dont mean the SAME THING...?? :/\"\n;)\n\nDean Clifford: Contracts are an operation of law, Derek. They are 99% unwritten, and established by your actions....but that does not negate the requirements. I'm open for business. We have only one thing we have the right to establish when it comes to a contract.....impress me.....\n\n3 words......but ohhhhhhhhhh so important........\n\nEspecially when serving \"HER MAJESTY\", the general contractor who wants something from you............\n\nDerek Moran: 3 words, im supposed to guess i take it...? How about 4 - i guessed this during a post Derek Hill put-up the other day:\n\n\"...unless otherwise expressly required...\"\n\n�security� means sufficient security, and �sureties� means sufficient sureties, and when those words are used one person is sufficient therefor, unless otherwise expressly required;\n\nhttp://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-21/FullText.html\n\nDean Clifford: No, that's their Policy. Do you not have one?\n\nScott Duncan: WHO ARE YOU?\n\nBY WHAT AUTHORITY!\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED!\n\nI DO NOT CONSENT.\nOh those three word trinities!\n\nDwaine Carrillo: Offer-Acceptance and Valuable Consideration\n\nDean Clifford: Close, Dwaine. There are 3 words I attach to EVERY offer for me to perform. They are my \" ... .... .......\"\n\nDean Clifford: Oh, I always consent now, Scott. In accordance with my \"..... ... .........\" I even put the correct amount of dots for letters on that one.\n\nDwaine Carrillo: Your Reserved Rights ... and theirs too\n\nSev Ren: ive been told that one doesnt work all to well\n\nScott Duncan: Oh well, if you've been told... best not read anything here.\n\nGo read the shit the guy who told you says. Wouldn'd want to contradict some guy who knows a guy.\n\nDean Clifford: In fact, it's the only way I would ever serve HER MAJESTY, is under my \"..... ... ..........\"\n\nDean Clifford: Forced compliance is acceptance of my \"..... ... ..........\" lol\n\nDean Clifford: I won't perform for HER MAJESTY unless it's under my \"..... ... ..........\", and further contact is acceptance of my \"..... ... ..........\"\n\nDwaine Carrillo: Forced Compliance is Acceptance of my Terms and Conditions!\n\nDean Clifford: \"Terms and Conditions!\", Dwaine wins the prize!!!! A date to burn down the town of choice with Dean Clifford!\n\nScott Duncan: ALL rights reserved.\n\nNot just YOUR rights... ALL of them. Even the Government's\n\nDean Clifford: Dwaine Carrillo: \"Forced Compliance is Acceptance of my Terms and Conditions!\"\n\nDean Clifford: NEVER question Bruce Dickenson!!!!\n\nDean Clifford: Actually, Between \"All Rights Reserved\" (depending on your status and the rights you have access to) and \"Terms and Conditions\" for Service. This world would be fixed tomorrow. Provided one fucking Person knew WHAT IT MEANT!\n\nScott Duncan: You probably should. It's ALL trinities.\n\nDean Clifford: Derek Moran: [I] DO NOT CONSENT (bit-of-a-cheat there)\nDean Clifford: I Most CERTAINLY consent...on the following terms and conditions.......\n\nDwaine Carrillo: Stay in Honor .... Always consent .... with terms and conditions\n\nDerek Moran so to review:\n\nWHO ARE YOU?\n\nBY WHAT AUTHORITY!?\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nDean Clifford: I Most CERTAINLY consent...on the following terms and conditions.......\n\n\"Forced Compliance is Acceptance of my Terms and Conditions!\" (not a 'Trinity' here, not even close)\n\nDwaine Carrillo: If they don't rebut (your terms), they MUST agree to them .... works both ways\n\nAnd when two people agree, we now have LAW\n\nDean Clifford: If my Big Mac is advertised for $50,000 up front, and some cocksucker eats it........... we have done to them, what they do to us.\n\nDwaine Carrillo: God Damn, I love that! .... \"Forced Compliance is Acceptance of My Terms and Conditions\"\n\nI'm getting that painted on the side of the H2\n\nDean Clifford: Anything else would be involuntary servitude. Law, for the plebians, 101.\n\nRebut my terms? They have a say in what my time is worth and what I do with my life? It's a take it or leave it kind of thing......\n\nScott Duncan: \"Rebut my terms\", Dean? Who exactly will do that?\n\nThe government is NOT a PERSON.\n\nDerek Moran: Terms-and-Conditions:\n\nAny PARTY without having made it EXPRESSLY known to ME ab initio, that you INTEND to ATTEMPT, to contract with ME, then ANY party attempting to contract with ME without the EXPRESS NOTICE required, such attempts SHALL be considered NULL-and-VOID ab initio and of no LAWFUL and/or LEGAL force-and-effect.\n\n..and that goes 'trinity' for Scott Duncan",
