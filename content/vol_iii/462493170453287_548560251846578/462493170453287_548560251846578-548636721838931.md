   "message": "Well, let me tell you that I gave a 'ride' to a bunch of idiots to a crack dealers house. (I did not know of my predicament) \nWe pulled up and a tinted car got in front of my vehicle. ( the same vehicle that was snooping around Family Court and CYF$ last year, taking pictures of us raising awareness ;) and wanting to know who our new friends were...Protecting Canadian Children)\nSo, the boy got out and tried to secure the deal.  We waited and he chatted to fellow crack heads.  Knocked again.  No go.  \nAfter 20 minutes, we leave and I am not around two corners and we have all kinds of cruisers, officers, both uniformed and not, and wagons.  They know who we ALL are in the car.  I tell the boys to shut up and roll up.  \nThe cops harass me and my passengers and ask me for a license.  Here is my Declaration, officers.  :)  I do not have a license.  You will have to issue me a ticket.  They threaten me with arrest.  I say I left my purse at home and YOU are wasting MY time.  Give me your badge numbers.  :P  They then got mad at me and stated I was wasting their time.  :)  And I drove off... after they did.  :)",
