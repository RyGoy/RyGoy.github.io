   "message": "I am not wanting to steal Sï¿½il Eile's spotlight.  I have my own questions to post. I am super overwhelmed, for us all! And for educational purposes...\n\nI came at this from a Human Rights perspective and can not see much difference...it is accounting and surety.\n\nAdmiral Duncan has been aware of my status, as a human being, from God.  I have not opened my Bible this year.  :)\n\nI will post regardless.  I know I must recollect my thoughts and re-read Suil's thread.  :)\n\nDoes the response and signature from my Lieutenant Governor mean the same thing; when he responded to my declaration of private law?\n\nI also have one from the Director of Civil Division, Dept. of Justice, on behalf of Senior Administration, Department of Justice, Minister and Attorney General of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and Lieutenant Governor.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=326852784095512&set=pb.100003123781499.-2207520000.1376496568.&type=3&theater",
