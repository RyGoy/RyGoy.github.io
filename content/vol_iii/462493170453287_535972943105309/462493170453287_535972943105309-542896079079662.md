Was funny  ;-)\nbut the whole peace and love thing is not really real...\nwomen's lib was about taxing the population that wasn't being taxed... so how do you do that... liberate them.\nLove comes from a belief of some sort... I certainly care a great deal about some people but love... hmm that reeks of belief somehow..  \nI care deeply but this whole LOVE thing strikes me as part of the noble lie... like being faithful for the rest of your life... didn't fit me...\nBlue and Pink...  fuck it is all illusion but I am not a hindu or anything else for that matter ...\nI am me, farts, belch's and ring around the collar ;-)\nNo Equal",
