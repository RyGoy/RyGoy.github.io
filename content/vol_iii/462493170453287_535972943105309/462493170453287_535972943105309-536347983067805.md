   "message": "I have four of them accountable for not identifying themselves and seizing a car for no insurance that actually had insurance. I went straight to their station after the car got taken to see the senior member on duty who never identified himself either thought it was funny as he said the state can force me into contract and we are not ruled by consent, as i informed him this is not a police state did he know the difference between legal and lawful he turned the question to me so i told him the  diffrence the response was along the lines of \"shit\" slammed the hatch in my face and ran as i told him their is no authority without liability and i can hold him liable in his personal capacity should he not identify them. I went over his head for the  superintendent for the area yest and while asking for him met a perfect candidate for \"kick a cop in the face day\". This prick went nuts stating he doesn't have to talk to people like me screaming i asked him for identification he refused but have his number. So now my lien goes to the commissioner this week and for him to remove it he must identify them for me. They are all public servants and cannot refuse to identify themselves to me i think four cops will be put in their place real soon.",
