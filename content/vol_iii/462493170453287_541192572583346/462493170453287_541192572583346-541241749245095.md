   "message": "When you sign a promissory note for a mortgage, the money is created (exchanged from foreign banks)... so this home is already paid for... They do it when you write a cheque, get a car loan, etc. And when you write another cheque to \"pay\" for these loans... they steal it. The car is already paid for...
