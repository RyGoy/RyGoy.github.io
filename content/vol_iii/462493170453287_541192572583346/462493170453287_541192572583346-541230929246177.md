   "message": "Well I can produce a currency with a billion dollar market cap. - That ability is worth a conservative 5 million. I am worth at least that.\n\nI am a Master of Computer science. There is no technology being made today that I do not understand.\n\n...another 10 million...\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nCalculate how much money you make in a year. Double that (they rob you over 50% in taxes) and then take that amount and multiply it by the LEGAL maximum (75 years). Lien it for that amount. It's easy to show on the books. ;)",
