I only ever read about BoE ..    .fapfapfappityfapfap  .......my undersyanding is that when the banks loan ye CREDIT they give NO VALUABLE CONSIDERATION for the Credit that ye created.  What is their valuable consideration? ??\nA turd sammich.\nThey are entitled to fuck all but a turd sammich straight back in the form o a BoE.\nCredit & money of account has more value than money o Exchange. \nI create new & original contracts with these muppets all the time. 99.9% of Lawyers will never ever get this shit in lawfully settling & tendering lawful currency.\nBanks will never ever produce any ORIGINAL CONTRACT so it's up to US to create new contracts by utilising the info on BoE etc etc.\nHere's one for the group. If ye ever read any bank act/rule etc....they always refer to themselves as WE OR US & refer to us as 'YOU' & WE refer to you as I.....SINGULAR......BUT....THE BANKS USE PLURALS WHEN REFERRING TO THEMSELVES....\nSwitch the words they use on US & WE BECOME THE BANK.....THEY BECOME \"YOU\"..........",
