   "message": "Yes Derek Hill, I think you have huge testicles and I have learned from you....for instance, I had property stolen from me at the side of the road on Tuesday...first thing I did was go to Staples and get an Invoice pad and a red Sharpie. I was going to VOID the tow order (which the poor guy didn't have, so instead, he got a large invoice).  Now, where do you think I learned that?  Kudos bro!",
