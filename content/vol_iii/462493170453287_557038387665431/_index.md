   "message": "What are you thoughts on this ?\n[526] It occurs to me that �fee schedules� may also have a potential criminal effect. Documents of this kind are intended to impede the legitimate action of government, law enforcement, and court actors by purporting to assign very sizable penalties for actions that are not only a part of their jobs, but very often a duty. These penalties are a threat of �damage to property�. Since �fee schedules� have no legal force, the threats they contain are by definition unlawful.\n\n[527] If so, it seems that perhaps when a person advances a �fee schedule�, that may be prima facie evidence of the act and intention of the Criminal Code, ss. 423.1, intimidation of a justice system participant offence. Advancing a �fee schedule� and claims based on the same, may perhaps also prove other criminal offences. Mr. Meads� �fee schedule� claims damages that clearly escalate in a manner that offends the Criminal Code, s. 347 criminal interest rate prohibition. Documents of this kind may have relevance for whether bail should be granted or denied: R. v. Boisjoli, 2012 ABQB 556 at para. 51.",
