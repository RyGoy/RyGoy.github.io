   "message": "Obviously there is some misunderstanding about many of the elements involved here.\n1.) \"Documents of this kind are intended to impede the legitimate action of government, law enforcement, and court actors\"\nThe actions for which the fee schedule addresses are NOT legitimate actions. They are criminal acts. They are acts which have no authority when waged against a living man.\n2.) \" when a person advances a �fee schedule�,\"\nA PERSON is not advancing the fee schedule, a living man is.\n\nCodes, Regulations, Statutes, and Ordinances, are tools used to govern FICTIONS, not living man, who is self-governing by rule of Natural Law.\n\nOnce you figure out who you really are, come back and make the proper argument.",
