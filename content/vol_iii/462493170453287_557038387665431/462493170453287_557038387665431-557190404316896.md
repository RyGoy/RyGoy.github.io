   "message": "Well, i dont like using fee schedule wording. I always love using it in a contractual way, like the obligations created would or or will be this, if by the acts/conduct of the parties. See, you can always determine how the other parties are able to demonstrate their agreements with you, if they do certain acts or certain signs, its an agreement/contract.  isnt contract law a higher form of law than statue ? :D",
