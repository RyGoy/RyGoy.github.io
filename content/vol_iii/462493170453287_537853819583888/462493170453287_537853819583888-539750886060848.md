   "message": "really interesting (Y) i had no idea of haarp's potential.I watch a bit of space weather each day so i'm aware there are far greater factors \"off world\" which influences weather & quakes.the  obvious clue with chemtrails is its an aerial spray therefore indiscriminate, Queen lizzy hasn't yet devoured her grandchildren so i'm guessing she's probably invested in their good health (unless of course they ARE chemical breathing lizard aliens ). even if there was a \"ming the merciless\" deathray hitting earth (the obvious inspiration for this hysteria),...what is \"telling\" everyone  gonna solve . i struggle to feel sorry for them because if the day ever did come where they \"woke\" everyone up, they'd find everyone else just as inept to do anything about it as them.the fluoride in the water? i distill mine to remove that & a lot more unidentified shit i'd be more worried about, they scream for Govt to come save them because they cant take simple steps to improve circumstances for themselves .. \"we just have to wake everyone up\" oh thats a fuckin hilarious excuse for sitting in a pool of your own mental excrement. we haven't got time to think, the time for action is now- face palm :p",
