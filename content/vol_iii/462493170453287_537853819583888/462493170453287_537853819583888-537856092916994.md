   "message": "\"HAARP is an ionospheric research facility. Its best-known apparatus is its 3.6 MW HF (approximately 3 to 10 MHz) ionospheric research instrument (IRI), feeding an extensive system of 180 gain antennas and used to �excite� sections of the ionosphere. Other onsite equipment is used to evaluate the effects.\"\n\nWhat's the desired outcome of said excitation of the ionosphere? (After you explain ionosphere itself, please.)",
