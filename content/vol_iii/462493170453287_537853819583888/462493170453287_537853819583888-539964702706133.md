   "message": "Nikola Tesla advocated the use of a HAARP like device to improve the physical and mental health of all people. He noted, as many other scientists did, that the planet itself, and all \"healthy\" plants and animals have a resonance frequency between 6 - 8 megahertz (if I recall correctly). Frequencies above, or, below this level create the conditions for the loss of health/mental capacity/clarity. As a side note, Pete Townshend, of The Who, reported that he \"cured\" his heroine addiction in 24-48 hours by using a machine based on this technology which re-tuned his resonance frequency to between 6-8 megahertz. After the treatment, he reported that he had absolutely no cravings/desire for heroine whatsoever. Many fields of science are recognizing these implications as well as the importance of vibration and its impact upon the universe.",
