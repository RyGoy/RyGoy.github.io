   "message": "Would not ALL monies go into a Consolidated Fund of the city of Vancouver and Then be dispersed there with no accountability.\nAs a business owner I have wrestled with this concept for years and only here at TTFL did the balloon burst. My understanding of it is that ALL CORPORATE ENTITIES that comprise 'CANADA' the Government of, use the slush fund of 'CONSOLIDATED FUND. This would be the ONLY way to stop ACCOUNTABILITY. I respond only to say that the concept of '2 sets of books' is wrong. There is only 1 set but the trail 'disappears' at the gates of the CONSOLIDATION FUND.\nAny thoughts?",
