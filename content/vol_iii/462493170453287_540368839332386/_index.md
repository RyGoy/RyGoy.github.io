   "message": "I had to race back home to let everyone in on the newest situation that has just developed. I had gone to the court house yesterday to get a copy of my family court order, a certified true copy, and they tried  handing me a copy that I sent back to the court house that I had declined. Then the court administrator came out and stated that I couldn't have a copy because of some marks that had been put on it. So I had to wait till today to see what the judge would say about it. So anyways I stopped in today at the friendly neighbourhood court house and asked for a true copy of the family court order. The clerk is a little miffed and goes to the back and comes back out with the file. Any ways I wasn't paying much attention at first, but then I noticed her put an envelope down, and then she started comparing two documents page for page. Then she grabs a stamp and starts to stamp it and I said no, if that is going to be your certified true copy that isn't it. I want a true certified copy of the order.  Well it is a mirror copy of the original and it has not been tampered with. It is the exact same thing except it has not been tamper with. Well the original one has been tampered with or destroyed so I can't get you a copy of that but this is just as good. I said no. I want a true certified copy of the original, I can't give you that because it is damaged. I said I guess that I�m not going to get one then. I had notice that the sheriffs in the court house were acting a little weird but wasn't paying attention. So as I'm walking out of the administrative office and into the lobby, an RCMP officer says Brenda. And of course I�m so used to answering and I said yes. And of course right after that I realized again what I had done. I'm officer so and so and I have a court order to take your daughter into custody. Is she with you? I said no. Do you know where she is? I said no. Was she with you last night? I said am I under arrest? No. Well then I'm free to go then? I said bye. And walked out of the court house. He also handed me a faxed a few times copy of the ex parte order to pick the kid up, anywhere in Nova Scotia. So my next move is to go to the next town over and pick up a true certified copy of the EX PARTE ORDER FOR SECTION 29 OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT and get my handy dandy void stamp out and start stamping like a mad woman. And I should also drop copies of the ex parte order voided and with notices of mistake to the court house and community services and still debating the RCMP detachment.",
