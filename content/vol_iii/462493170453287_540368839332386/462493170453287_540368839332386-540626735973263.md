   "message": "This is what my bestest buds had to say at the always friendly community service office in lieu of my visit with my youngest daughter this morning: The reason why I want to talk to you is that you are aware based on the events of yesterday that we have people and the police out actively searching for Cat because she has run from the foster placement. And we have credible information that she is at your place. So we are wondering where she is. And what you can tell us about that. I�m here for a visit with Carole. I understand that but we have care and custody of Cat, and there is currently an order to locate and detain her, which is an order through Child Welfare, that gives the police the authority to be able to search for her and detain her until she is found, so that we can ascertain her safety. And because she is in the care and custody of the agency, it is imperative that we find out where she is, so that we can make sure that she is safe. That doesn�t mean that we will be taking her some place, that means we need to know where she is. So that we can say that we know that she is safe. And it is important for you to know that we do have credible � that we know that she is with you. What that means is that you are breaching court order, which is against the law and it also means that you are harbouring as runaway.  Right, so there is going to have to be some consideration made as to where that leaves you, as far as legally. So the police are going to be very involved with that, continue to be involved in searching for her and in determining if there is a role that they have in charging you with harbouring a runaway. Right, because that is against the law. So I need to know where she is. Am I going to have a visit with Carole or not? Your not going to have a visit with Carole. Why not? Well what would you think about that? What do you mean? It is my right to have a visit with her. It�s Carole�s right to have a visit with her mother. It�s her right first and foremost to be save. And last week, there was not one but two attempts under fraudulent circumstances to take her back. Right, so the agency has all that information that you tried to serve a paper, that is not a legal document on people who do not have care and custody of Carole, to have her returned to you. And that is against the law and in fact that is what some might consider kidnapping. Right, so that is very serious.  So when we have someone that is not working with the agency, and attempting to go behind our backs and behind the backs of the law, you certainly cannot expect to have access with her. No? OK. So there will be no more access until things change, and we need you to tell us where Cat is at. As long as we don�t know where she is, then we can�t put a plan in place for her to ensure that she is safe, then we are going to be continued to rely on the assistance of the police and to determine if there is any other recourse that we can have under the law, to gain access to your home or to locate her in some way. You have to know that the police and family court, takes this very seriously. Family court judge ordered her in the care and custody of the agency, so for that not to be happening, a family court judge is not going to be very pleased. Right, so I not saying at this point, we would like to talk to Cat, and determine what the best plan for her is, clearly she wants to be at home or clearly she doesn�t want to be in the care of the agency. If that is the case I am certainly happy to sit down and talk to her about it is she does want. But I need to lay eyes on her and I need to do that today. She has in essence been missing for a week. I�m sure that you are familiar with missing persons and amber alerts, any and all reasonable actions a police officer and child welfare worker can take, in order to locate a child. We do take this very seriously. So I need to tell us where she is. I�m done. I guess so that I�m not going to have a visit, I won�t be back until you notify me and let me know that I can have a visit again. That is really unfortunate Brenda.",
