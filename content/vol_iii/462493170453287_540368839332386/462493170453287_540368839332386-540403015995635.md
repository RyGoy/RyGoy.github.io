   "message": "Robert Cormier, I already have defaulted affidavits for 5 RCMP officers (including staff sergeant, 2 cpls, 2 constables). And I was also told by the staff sergeant that if I tried to serve any more of my paper work at the detachment that he would sue me personally. Not that I am worried, but nothing really scares them. I think that it is time to start some court action. Just not too sure how to proceed, but I think that I will start with a test case of the failure to file a writ of habeas corpus for me would be a good one to start of with.",
