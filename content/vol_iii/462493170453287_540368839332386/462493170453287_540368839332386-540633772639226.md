   "message": "This is the letter that I dropped off to them last week.\n July 17, 2013\n\nAntigonish DCS\n229 Main Street\nAntigonish, Nova Scotia\n\nAttention:\n\nI am a human being with inherent unalienable rights attached, I am not the legal person. I have pointed out to you and your agency that I don�t consent or contract with you. On numerous occasions I have declined and not consented to the Temporary Care and Custody Order. You have kidnapped my offspring and held them in detention without proof of claim. I have asked for such evidence and you have failed to produce it. I have asked for you to produce evidence that I am contracting with you or consenting and you have failed to produce it. You have failed to produce evidence that I have harmed or injured my offspring. The worst part is that when you took them into your �care� did you do due diligence in establishing that my offspring where harmed in any way? No, and you have produced no such evidence. As a matter of FACT you chose to take 42 days to take them for a medical, although you claim that you took them in 30 business days. You at the onset of the Protection Application, had an opportunity to court order an assessment and chose not to. Where is your evidence that my offspring were emotionally harmed? You have none. All of your actions are unlawful. I now advise you that this morning I have voided the Temporary Care and Custody Order. I DEMAND that you return my offspring immediately to their mother and father before you cause any more damage or injury. YOU HAVE NO LEGAL OR LAWFUL RIGHT TO KEEP MY OFFSPRING.",
