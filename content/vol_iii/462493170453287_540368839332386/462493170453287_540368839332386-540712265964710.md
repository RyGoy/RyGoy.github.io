   "message": "well it is a court... like in the days of The KIng holding court... everyone there is a trustee and the justice holds surety until you consent by responding to their questions without establishing proper standing... they want to pass the hot potato of SURETY to you in any sneaky underhanded way the can think of,  creating joinder...\n   If one is the only one with standing... logically it would lead to the ability to order the clerk to what is required at that particular moment... like holding them accountable.\n\nVOIDING orders  and establishing new originals seems the simplest way to circumvent\nALL of that....\n\nYou have to go to the clerk to do anything with your court file... so OWN it, with a lien as well....",
