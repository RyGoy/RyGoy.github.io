   "message": "What I did was ask for certified true copies of the new court order, got those in my hot little hands, took it out to the car stamped it with my handy dandy little void stamp then went to the nearest photocopying place and asked for colored copies of the order. Then went to the post office stuck the voided new original true certified copy in the envelope and sent it register mail back to the court house, so that way I will have a record of them receiving it. When I went there this afternoon, right away the clerk running out to the back and a sheriff came out to the front. And I now that if I just tried to hand the family court clerk back that document she will refuse it. So that way after they get it, I don't care what they do with it I have delivered it and proof of it.",
