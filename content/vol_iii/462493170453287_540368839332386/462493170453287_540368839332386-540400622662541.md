   "message": "I'd make a complaint in writing to the RCMP. A PRESENTMENT allowing X amount of days to investigate and report back to you in writing. Not as an appeal to your rapists, but rather to demonstrate (in part) that you have exhausted your ability to achieve an administrative remedy to these shenanigans.  Perhaps followed by a NOTICE OF DEFAULT, giving them 10 more days to remedy and provide justice. Then LIEN, LIEN, LIEN!  Thinking out loud.",
