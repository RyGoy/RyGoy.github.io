   "message": "That is reality.\n\nThis man has the innate ability to truly \"see\" nature. That's what the nobility robbed his people of. It was done with intent. It it the theft of the MOST IMPORTANT insight, and it was replaced with an evil, ignorant, violent, misogynist ideology with an imaginary sky-daddy and a rape-baby.\n\nMaa Nathltaapaan has held on to what was taken from his people. It is a theft that I will not participate in, and it should anger and frighten you that there are people who will WILLINGLY and KNOWINGLY do that sort of thing.\n\nAs I've said before: I fully endorse what Maa, has to say. You should listen to him. We teach different paths to the same end goal. Mine tends to have a body count. His does not.\n\nI need machines to see what he does. I see farther than he does, but he sees MORE.\n\nWe are so very different, but we both know what's right. LISTEN to him. The right answer is the same, no matter WHO says it.",
