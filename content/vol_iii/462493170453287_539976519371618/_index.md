   "message": "Those sneaky fuckers! Currently patrolling the highways of the GTA, are shiny, new, black police SUV's. \n\nThey have NO markings, (not even the hidden, black-on-black decals), and NO exterior lights. The red and blues are built in, and look like normal head and tail lights. Not even any external antennae!",
