   "message": "\"Property: That which is peculiar or proper to any person; that which belongs EXCLUSIVELY to one; in the strict legal sense, an aggregate of rights which are guaranteed and protected by the government. The term is said to extends to every species of valuable right and interest. More specifically, property is ownership; the unrestricted and exclusive right to a thing; the right to dispose of a thing in every legal way, to possess it, to use it, and to exclude EVERY ONE ELSE from interfering with it. That dominion or definite right of use or disposition which one may lawfully exercise over particular things or subjects. Property is the highest right a man can have to anything; being used for that right which one has to lands or tenements, goods or chattels, which NO WAY depends on another man's courtesy. The right of property is that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in TOTAL exclusion over the right of ANY other individual in the universe. It consists in the free use, enjoyment, and disposal of person's acquisitions, without ANY control or diminution save only the laws of the land.\"",
