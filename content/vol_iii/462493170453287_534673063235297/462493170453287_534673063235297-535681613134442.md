   "message": "Hey, I was attempting to offer support to one of my 'sisters' on here going through a very trying time dealing with questionable actions of others at best...injustices are always going to evoke emotions, and when it deals with family & loved ones, especially children, very strong emotions.\n\nWhen I read this post initially, I thought that the primary aim was to get two children back to their mum, out of harms way, period.\n\nI offered support re the children in question, and got a few strong responses re two bits of paper (BCs), which if you lien the legal persons and/or the case files, the BCs no longer have any value to the other party, regardless of who 'owns' them.\n\nThe important issue is the kids in question, at least that's what I thought this post was about.  If it were my kids, I wouldn't give two shits about the bits of paper until AFTER the kids were back in my safe care...then I'd worry about any shitstains I'd left behind at a later time.\n\nTo borrow from the WalMart example above:  When I'm dragging my kids away from WalMart, away from the manager in question, I don't give two shits if he thinks he owns the shoes they're wearing...he can have them...but I'm taking the kids.  Everything else is secondary.\n\nI wish you well and absolutely support the return of your flesh and blood.  We are all learning here & my suggestions were offered as another possibility & support only.  You have the best mentor imaginable, so I doubt I can offer anything that could even come close from any other standpoint except support.  Re emotionally hot topics, I'll leave commenting to those way better qualified from now on.  Whatever ends up happening, I wish you the safe return of your babies.",
