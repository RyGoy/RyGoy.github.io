   "message": "Both of our lawyers bailed on us last year and I have been doing what I can to try and learn, and have been self representing ever since. I may have messed up a few hearings that we were supposed to have but the good thing is that if they had gone ahead with those hearings I would have accepted jurisdicition and I am greatful to that. The last time that I was in court June 18, I sent in an affidavit that stated that I was not the legal name, i was there by special appearance and had put in notices of mistake for myself, the old man and kids. And I was sitting at the back of the court. At the end the justice looked up and said well Ms. Larson do you have any questions? And as soon as the word no left my lips, Fuck, I knew that I had fucked up in answering no. Come to think of it now, I probably fucked up in more than that one way I should have had a shit load of questions.",
