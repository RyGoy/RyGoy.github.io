   "message": "Well, first things first. The only person that appears to be taking comments personally, and reacting with emotion, is you. I don't tend to think and react like your typical female, so just try to take what I say at face value and make no assumptions about emotional intent. The point IS just to get the children back. But the Children's Aid Society is NOT the court...so my point was, why would I submit to their authority by even allowing them access to the LEGAL PERSONS? Walmart claiming the shoes are theirs is one thing. Since they sell shoes, they would have \"JURISDICTION\" over shoes leaving the store that potentially haven't been paid for, and the right to investigate. They DON'T have any JURISDICTION over the children wearing the shoes...",
