Please let me not feel them.\nWhile spending almost ALL my spare time that I can make to be here and study I always come back to;\n1) They kidnapped my child. I am going to hunt them down and get back my child. Not Negotiate with them.\n2) You are going to take my car? Really? Over my dead body you will. Let us have at it.\n3) Hey , You Bank, You allowed a third party to meddle with my money? Who do I have to shot to correct that.\nI KNOW many will have issues with me here. But are we just playing in their arena when we really should be canceling everything we have done with them and then simple protect what is ours after that?",
