   "message": "Looking back, I have to say that being charged with assault this past January was actually a good thing. It gave me a \"practice run\" at the court system, on something fairly trivial, and was an excellent learning experience.\n\nBut now, on to bigger and INFINITELY more important things...\n\nI'm going after the Children's Aid Society and the Ontario Court of Justice, for the theft of my children. I haven't gotten very far yet, but here is my first draft:\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\nIn ALL matters regarding  XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXXXXX \"TOSTIK\", and XXXXXXX-XXXXX \"BUTLER\" (hereafter referred to as \"PROPERTY\"), I believe that there has been a mistake as my PROPERTY have been incorrectly identified as LEGAL PERSONS. If I have led the COURT and/or the CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY to believe that said PROPERTY are in fact LEGAL PERSONS, and/or WARDS, and/or ANY other LEGAL FICTION, then that would be a mistake and please forgive me.\n\nAs ALL signatures and/or consents pertaining to said PROPERTY have been obtained by the COURT and the SOCIETY through FRAUD and/or UNDER DURESS, I hereby rescind ALL consents, written, and or verbal, and/or implied, nunc pro tunc, ab initio.\n\nAs this court is in fact a PRIVATE, FOR-PROFIT business, listed on Dunn and Bradstreet as THE GOVERNMENT OF ONTARIO, operating as \"ONTARIO COURT OF JUSTICE\", and as so, ONLY has jurisdiction over LEGAL PERSONS, by what authority is this court attempting to administer over my property?\n\nAs the CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY is nothing more than a PRIVATE, FOR-PROFIT business, operating under the COLOUR OF LAW, by what authority is the SOCIETY attempting to administer over, and withhold my PROPERTY?\n\nAs neither the COURT, not the CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY have ANY authority and/or jurisdiction in this matter, I REQUIRE the immediate return of my PROPERTY.\n\nI'm not sure if this is the proper route to be taking. There isn't an open case at the moment. But they've been harassing me since waaaaay back, before I knew that saying no to them was an option. \n\nClearing up the \"consents\" needs to be the first step, I'm thinking. Is a Notice of Mistake the best way to do that, though, or should I be drafting a Notice of Rescission and then following that up with my Claim?",
