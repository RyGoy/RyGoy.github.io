   "message": "There was a couple in New Brunswick, (They have a video on Youtube from back in February of this year) that attempted to dismiss the CPS case against them, as Living Beneficiaries, but it didn't work. They brought their own, one-page, 12 sentence-long COMMON LAW claim into court for TRESSPASS against their PROPERTY. They stated that if no one else could produce a more valid CLAIM to the PROPERTY, they REQUIRED the immediate return. If I recall correctly, they were in court on Wednesday, and had their five kids politely returned the following week.",
