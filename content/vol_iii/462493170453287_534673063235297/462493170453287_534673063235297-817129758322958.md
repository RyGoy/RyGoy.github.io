   "message": "It's worse than you know. There are \"legends\" of people like Ceit in court, but that shit only happens in Toronto with that \"Scott Duncan\" guy. (Yes. They ALL know who I am)\n\nThey were NOT expecting it to happen in their podunk courthouse. There was NO connection to ME. This sent a shockwave up to the Attorney General's office. LOTS of policy changes happened then.\n\nThe Deputy Attorney General then, as a result, started compiling EVERYTHING about ALL of us.\n\nIt became obvious that everything they had \"on record\" is misdirection. The records themselves are contradictory, and only make sense, if I PUT THEM THERE. (I learned a LOT being an errand-boy for Casey Hill). It worked for $CIENTOLOGY, and it worked for me :D\n\nThat's why people get REALLY twitchy when my name is mentioned in court.\n\nThis means more than you understand. This same story is playing out ALL OVER THE WORLD AT THE EXACT SAME TIME. ALL ARE AQUILAE!\n\n*** Dramatic music here ***\n\n...no really. WE ARE COMING!\n\n...but for the Attorneys General, worldwide:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wDjxCy3yIMI",
