The term \"chattels\" is a more comprehensive one than \"goods\", as it includes animate as well as inanimate property.\" and then this: Claim and Delivery: \"an action at law for the recovery of specific personal chattels wrongfully taken and detained, with damages which the taking or detention has caused; in substance a modern modification of the Common Law action of Replevin.\"",
