The term is generally applied to property of a personal or movable nature, as opposed to property of a local or immovable nature (such as land or houses).\" , and this: Private Property: \"private property, as protected from being taken for public use, is such property as belongs absolutely to an individual, and of which he has the exclusive right of disposition.\"",
