   "message": "Got messages that they don't understand the voiding of orders.\n\nwww.dosrpg.net/other/affidavit.jpg\nwww.dosrpg.net/other/order1.jpg\nwww.dosrpg.net/other/order2.jpg\n\nI just included the restraining order, it was really the only one i was concerned with.\n\nView the documents. The key points is the CERTIFIED COPY on top left corner over seal, the new original printed on top of both pages and the VOID on the second page of the order.\n\nI don't have a copy with the VOID printed with ink, because I didn't make a copy with the red ink so i used my awesome paint skills to put void on there anyways.\n\nIf you still do not understand these simple things, then you might want to consider getting your head checked.\n\nScott Duncan, did i miss anything, im sure i covered this. I just want to make it more solid to get the point across with less hassle. Even though my first attempt worked like a charm, you will not always get easy going people to go along with it.\n\nOr would you prefer to keep it simple like the above?",
