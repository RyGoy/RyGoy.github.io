   "message": "In this scenario, don't you end up with property owned/registered by the government, being \"controlled\" by a corporation owned by the government? So how does this allow (if at all) ME to have any EXTRA CONTROL of the property that I don't want the government seizing? ME at the side of the road: Police officer, this car is in a trust managed by a corporation. You can't tow it. POLICE: It's registered with the government, I'll do what I want. ME (at the door of my house): Mr Police Officer/Bailiff, you can't enter this home, take possession, change the locks as it is in a trust managed by a corporation. Police: \"Your\" home is registered to the government. Step aside. ME (a la a Dean Clifford like scenario): You can't start seizing my property and freezing assets because the CRA thinks i owe you 60k when I only made 18K in income). You've must of made a mistake, besides all of it is in a trust managed by a corporation. JUSTICE: I don't give a rats ass, we will take/seize/freeze what we want because everything you are talking about is registered to US. Don't the courts determine TRUSTS all the time even though TRUST LAW is HIGHER than ACTS and STATUES? :(",
