   "message": "As i now understand, if I PURCHASE something, I own it. Owning something means I have LEGAL TITLE to it. Having LEGAL TITLE DOES NOT necessarily SIGNIFY FULL AND COMPLETE TITLE OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST. I do get a nice receipt for ACCOUNTING PURPOSES however. :) ( I guess I could accept a BILL and use a blue pen, provide my signature and DISCHARGE the debt I created when agreed to purchase/buy the product) Would this take the purchase out of the PUBLIC?",
