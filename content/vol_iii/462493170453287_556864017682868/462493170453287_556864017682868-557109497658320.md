   "message": "Forgive me for being slow on the uptake here. I realize that I am to understand that the LIEN will grant first rights here. Where I lose grasp of the concept, is that if their is a dispute over the lien I placed, the COURTS will ultimately decide if my LIEN is to be upheld. Example, as far as I understand, a mechanic can do real work on a car then lien it, complete with video proof and receipts for parts he installed, that he did the work. If the recipient of the work challenges the lien, IS THE JUSTICE REALLY GOING TO SAY...I CAN\"T TOUCH THIS CASE AS THEIR IS A LIEN ON THE CAR, you must ask the mechanic for justice regarding the car and never again involve the courts because it is out of our jurisdiction? My brain short circuits too easily sometimes. :(",
