   "message": "By the way Pete Daoust and Adam Thomas I was told today that rcmp would not take a complaint as they have been told that my younger kid is safe and in the care of the agency. Also two of the middle daughters friends got their homes searched looking for the kid. The social worker told one of the kids parents again that our home and property is unsafe for them to go to. What the fuck? So if we have the kid tied up and beating her in the closet too bad for her, cause it is unsafe for the rcmp or the social workers to come here? What a sad sack of shit in both agencies. CPS also texted the kid stating that they are going to continue searching peoples homes looking for her, unless she complies with see cps. I would think that this is at the very least harassment.",
