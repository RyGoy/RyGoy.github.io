   "message": "I have an interesting story from today as well but just not that intense as Derik�s. I went down to the court house to finish the paper work and get a claim started to get my property back. When I got there I was told to have a seat and as soon as someone was finished with doing something with another client that they would deal with me. As I sat waiting, I noticed an RCMP officer heading to the front door of the courthouse. Of course he was coming in my direction and when he got close enough, he asked if I was Brenda. I stated that I am commonly called Brenda. He told me that he had a recording device and that it was there to record what I said and he said, so that way he couldn�t say I had said something and I couldn�t say he said something. (Funny how recording devices work!) So he told me he was there to talk about my missing daughter. I told him that I had no comment. Asked if I was under arrest. He stated no, and told me that I wasn�t under arrest or being detained. Then he moved on to a picture and stated is this your daughter, and I didn�t answer him. He told me that he was working with cps to try and locate her. Did I know where she was? No comment. Could I at least tell the officer if she was safe? No comment. I am here to get my documents. Are my documents ready yet? The stupid bitch behind the counter holds up a finger. Then some other people come walking in and the officer wants to know if I want to go into the lobby to talk. I didn�t acknowledge anything. So while we are sitting there waiting for the people to leave and my paper work to be ready, I asked the officer a question. If I want to make a complaint that my daughter is missing would you take that complaint? So what daughter is that, you have three right? Catherine is 15, and Carole is 13 and handicapped? And you have an older daughter. I said I'm only talking about the youngest one. If I want to make a complaint about my youngest one missing would you take that complaint? Well, he says, I know that cps has told me that she is fine where she is, I haven�t actually seen her, but they say she is fine. So you would not take my complaint? No cps says she is safe and fine. So I got up to pay for my paperwork and get the fuck out of there. He took his recorder and talks into it, stating that it is Aug. 1, 2013 at 10:34 am and talking to Brenda Larson. I said by what authority do you address me as Brenda Larson? Oh well that is just what I am saying into my recorder. He left and I got my paper work, and left as well. When I left I saw him standing on the opposite side of the street with his back turned to the courthouse. So I left and walked behind a strip mall, looking for the van, I spotted it. But practically next to it, was a Sheriffs truck, so I knew what was going on. I just kept on walking, and the van knew what was going on. Unfortunately, I had forgotten my cell phone but found a place to use the phone. The Sheriff kept pretty close to me and I was able to duck them when they were right outside a place of business, I went into to use the phone to be able to call and let the van know where I was headed. I rounded out the back of the building went through some back yards and was home free. Things should be heating up here shortly.",
