   "message": "Pete, I'm trying to tell you, cps told rcmp that kid is fine and safe and that is  all they are willing to hear; it does not matter what I say, I don't count and as of right now they think that I am acting \"criminally\" or above the law by not telling them where my middle daughter is or telling them that she is fine or letting them see her. I don't have the good standing with the rcmp like cps does. It doesn't matter what I say right now. They won't listen to me.",
