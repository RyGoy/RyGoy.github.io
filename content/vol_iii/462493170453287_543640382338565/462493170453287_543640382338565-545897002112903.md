   "message": "The part that I don't understand is how come they haven't been here yet and how come they are asking?

I don't know if it was the RCMP or CPS, something tells me it was cps, telling parents of kids' friends - don't remember exact words any more but crazy shit happens here and it is a dangerous place.",
