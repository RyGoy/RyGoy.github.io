   "message": "I will do that Pete Daoust. Thanks for straightening it up in my mind. When I was siting in the courthouse waiting (they did that on purpose) for my paper work to get it and pay for it. I saw the RCMP walking up the way and into the building. I knew that he was coming to see me, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I know that It sounds stupid, but I get very nervous, I know that I shouldn't but I didn't know if I was about to be arrested or what. Although I'm not scared to get arrested, have been twice before.  And then when there was a bit of a break because other people were coming into the courthouse I just by off chance decided to ask about making a complaint about the youngest one being missing, and stupid me didn't realize it was not missing but stolen. Just a by the way thing, I did hear on one of Karl Lentz audio's that a mother did walk into the cps office in Manitoba and demanded her property be returned and apparently it was without having to go to court.",
