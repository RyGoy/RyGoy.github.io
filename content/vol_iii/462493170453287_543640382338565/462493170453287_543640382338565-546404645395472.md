   "message": "One thing that I do have to say is that voiding a court order works. I have living proof of it. The original order was for a locate and detain order for the RCMP and I voided that one out. They got a new one issued the past Tuesday and the funny thing is that on this one it is stamped true certified copy, but my only question is how are they able to get these orders if the original order has been voided. Do I need to send in an affidavit of that fact, that the original Temporary Care and Custody Order has been voided? Pete tomorrow morning I am going to charge the workers with stealing my property.",
