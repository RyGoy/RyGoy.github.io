   "message": "well as of 11 am this morning, my one daughter was apprehended by force with a 6 member swat team in full tactical gear include what looked like guns but more so like grenade launchers, 2 RCMP armed with pepper spray and a dog handler with dog and armed with some kind of what looked like fire extingishers. All for one child that ran away from foster care and told cps to f off because she was finally happy again after almost 2 years and felt safer in her own home than any foster care she was ever in.",
