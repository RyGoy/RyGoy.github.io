   "message": "\"A DEBT was attached to you. DEBT=SLAVERY. \nYou STILL don't get that?\"\n\nI know- that comes off as a boneheaded-comment on my part. Only though, because i dont view the Birth Certificate as a Debt-Obligation for us FIRST. I see it as a GRATUITOUS PROMISE made by the Registrar General of Ontario at the time to me, FIRST. But because i have never really INVESTIGATED what the Birth Certificate truly represents, and that my continued possession of it makes me viewed in their eyes as the TRUSTEE, SAFEGUARDING this BOND still, this what then, makes it still a DEBT-OBLIGATION i am DEEMED SURETY FOR in the meanwhile.",
