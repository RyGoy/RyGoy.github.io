   "message": "All this from asking a question. This teaches me to NOT ask questions here.\nThis shit is so important as EVERY THING FORWARD from the LBR and BC is FROM the LBR AND BC.\nChallenge,\nBoth �BIRTH CERTIFICATES� are **BASICALLY** the same. They consist of TWO (2) parts, 1) the Certificate it self, 2) the information (which is an EXTRACT from the LBR) printed on the Certificate itself.\nTo say that The Certificate is a **COPY** I think is FALSE. The Ontario BC **SPECIFICALLY** states at the bottom �Canadian Bank Note�. ����Is anyone telling me that this is a *copy*?���� It itself was printed AS A �Canadian Bank Note�, �Certificate�, �Promissory Note�, just in blank. The Alberta BC **SPECIFICALLY** states on the back **this certificate** (promissory note) and that the **EXTRACTED** information is printed ON THE CERTIFICATE.\n\nSo we have 1) The Certificate/ Bank Note itself which is **ORIGINAL** and then, 2) The **EXTRACTED** (the copied) information then printed on the **ORIGINAL** Certificate/ Bank Note itself.\n\nI am PRESENTING the ACTUAL documents themselves for all to see AND READ. I am NOT producing ANY OTHER documents. PERIOD. Just the Birth Certificates themselves. I DO NOT CARE about ANY OTHER documents as THEY WERE NOT GIVEN/ASKED for regarding the Birth Certificates. ONLY what can be produced to be, by possession of.\n\nSo far I have heard that the Birth Certificate is a **COPY**.\nI call, BULLSHIT!\nThe Birth Certificate itself IS ORIGINAL, it is the EXTRACTED information that is a copy.\nThe Birth Certificate CONSISTS of TWO (2) PARTS.\nUsing ONLY the documentation at hand (the Birth Certificates I have posted photos of), I CHALLENGE **ANY ONE** to PROVE otherwise what I have said in the past, or above, REGARDING the Birth Certificates. Do not forget, I am only using the ACTUAL documents themselves.\n***READ the FUCKING Birth Certificates. ***\nAs to what transpired with the signing of the LBR by our parent/parents and the BC I have an opinion based only on thinking about the subject matter regarding our rights that we gained the moment we were born on this land and what was then agreed upon on our behalf by our Parents. How ever that is another story and off topic regarding my comments above.\nPlease Scott Duncan or other Admin Please FUCKING BAN ME because I keep getting drawn back only to get in to USELESS FUCKING arguments ***JUST BY ASKING A FUCKING QUESTION*** which by the way, STILL HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED! Proof is an answer, Opinion is not.\nOh wait a sec....I can just leave. Fuck me.",
