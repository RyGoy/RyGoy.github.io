   "message": "IS THIS ALL TRUE ?\n\nI have a person, its name is PIERRE DAOUST, this person has an inscription number, a certificate and blablabla�.\n\nAnd �ME�, the Man that gives value to this person, has the RIGHT to this person�s Life, Liberty and its security / Surety�.\n\nSo, �ME�, if I want, I can KILL this person, because if I have the rights on its life, I must have the rights on his death�..Like Mika did and all these guys who are in this movement called Free-Man-On-The-Land.\n\nBut why in the world would I want to do that ? :/\n\nEvery LEGAL BUSINESS is made through this LEGAL PERSON, that I have, and this LEGAL person has NO property, and it seems to be the GOVERNEMENT�s property anyway.\n\nSo, EVERY BILL I pick up in the mail box, seems to be addressed to that person named PIERRE DAOUST, and the SURETY of this person seems to be sitting in the Government�s bank, which is the Bank of Canada.\n\nSo, as a good ADMINISTRATOR for this person, I shall re-direct all of these bills where this person�s SURETY is ? (I did this 5 times, and so far, complete silence )\n\nSo why in the world would I want to kill this person ?, I mean, the way I see it, this person has been created to BENEFIT �ME� ?\n\nAnd since I HAVE ALL THE RIGHTS on it, It seems to me that I must be the MASTER of that person ?\n\nAs the MASTER, I get to DECIDE for it, so WHY these FMOTL wants to kill it ?\n\nOf course I will encounter some resistance to this, but if it�s the truth, at one point the truth will eliminate this resistance, and I had to deal with resistance all my life, so what�s the big deal��.anyway��\n\nIf I am dragged to court, for ANY reasons, (unless I�ve committed a real crime of course) and I start by RESERVING ALL RIGHTS, they are fucked ?.....I mean I can explaine all this shit to them, I can tell them I AM NOT the surety, never been, and never will�.I can ask them to PROVE ME WRONG, and even ask them to point to me WHERE IS THE SURETY please ?\n\nDean Clifford told me once that I am surety period, they only make false claims upon my person�why Dean told me this ?...is there 2 different ways to see this stuff ?\n\nExact words from Dean: You are the surety, period. They are just making false claims against your person\n\nAnd he followed up with: But Bank of Canada must settle the accounts, as they are trustee and you are insolvent in their system.\n\nAnd I followed up with these questions to Dean:\n\nSo you say that I AM the surety of the person ?\nThis person has been created for me right ?\nIt has been created when I was a month old appx right ?\nand someone, decided that I will be the surety of this person ?\nCan I decide to NOT be the surety ?\nOr, is this thing is hooked on me weither I like it or not ?\nAnother question I have is, Who is this someone that made that decision FOR me ?\nThis someone must have an AUTHORITY of some kind to make such decisions ?\nAnd, I am ALSO the beneficiary of this person, right ?\n\nAnd never heard anything after �. :(\n\nWHY is Scott says: I AM NOT SURETY\nAnd Dean says: I AM SURETY PERIOD.\n\nIf I have the right to the life of the person, the liberty of the person and the security/surety of the person, I can�t be the surety ?....if I have the right to it, and it�s not me who created it, how can I be it� ?\n\nAnyway�..please don�t give up on �ME� :D\n\nSigned\nPierre\nMaster of PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX",
