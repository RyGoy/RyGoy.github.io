   "message": "Please forgive my ignorance Rick, there is obviously some principle that I am missing re usufruct.  \n\nYour comment re: WHERE DOES IT SAY IT BELONGS TO YOU???? it only has the NAME of the \"PERSON\" REGISTERED>> are you a MAN or a PERSON????\n\nI'm the man.  I have (an extract, certificate, copy of) the person.\n\nAre you suggesting that the Notice of Mistake would negate these presumptions re surety and/or my mistakenly claiming the name?",
