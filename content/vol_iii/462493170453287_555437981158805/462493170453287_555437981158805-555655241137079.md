   "message": "Continue to make assumptions as to what I said when all you have to do is read what I wrote.\nStuart Stone sry but I REALLY do  think there is no real interest in what I might bring forward to the discussion. So far no one has addressed the actual BC. Now here is where others bring up other papers without addressing the actual documents. Kinda like \"Let's NOT discuss the actual document but let's talk about this other paper\"\nThats a circle jerk which I will not participate in.\nObviously I am to stupid ask a question and make comments in return. I shall now look at my actual documents and take them as false paper.\nCarry on.",
