   "message": "The system operates on trust law, but we as a \"private man\" are not a party to that Name Trust/Estate. We are are just a private man who has been SPOLIATED by way of a foreign corporate military invasion and seizure of our private property, via their war powers they operate under via their rules of war on land AKA General Orders 100 (Lieber Code)\n\nThe Name (First Middle Last ) is a fictitious Name for the purpose of conducting commerce with. The fictitious Name is the most valuable commodity man has. Without it man cannot conduct commerce within the artificial commerce system. As the OWNER of that fictitious Name the owner is liable for it.\n\nUnder the Foreign Corporation known as United States, Inc., which was formed under the reconstruction act after Lincoln turned the nation over to the military due to its original government dissolving upon its board members walking out never to return, the Military formed itself the new corporation known today as the UNITED STATES.\n\nAdvance forward to 1933 when that military corporation known as UNITED STATES went into bankruptcy. Under executive orders by their commander in Chief of their Military in conjunction with their foreign corporate military board members commonly known as CONgress, Declared a State of Emergency under its War Powers which supersedes all their Civil Codes, Regulations and Polices.\n\nUnder their Declared State of Emergency by way of Executive Orders and Banking Emergency Acts they came in and SEIZED ALL PRIVATE PROPERTY via section 38 of their Lieber Code and ALL PROPERTY was turned over to the STATE!\n\nThe fictitious commercial Name (First Middle Last) is PRIVATE PROPERTY. That is not YOU the man. That is merely a fictitious Name man must have to use to conduct commerce with.\n\nWhen you were born the hospital took the information, created the TITLE (Birth Certificate) for the fictitious commercial Name, and then sent that TITLE to the STATE so the STATE could registered the EVENT. Only the STATE never completed the delivery of that TITLE to the Name by sending the original to the parents. Instead the STATE kept the ORIGINAL by way of their Declared State of Emergency and SEIZED the TITLE to your PRIVATE PROPERTY via their War Powers under their Lieber Code section 38.\n\n38. Private property, unless forfeited by crimes or by offenses of the owner, can be seized only by way of military necessity, for the support or other benefit of the Army or of the United States.\n\nThe UNITED STATES having gone into bankruptcy came in and had to SEIZE all Private Property out of NECESSITY in order to continue to support its Army and bankrupt UNITED STATES CORPORATION.\n\nHaving SEIZED all your Private Property the commanding officer (Governor of State) signed into law their Vital Statistics Act causing for you the man (spoliated owner) to be issued a RECEIPT (Certified Copy of Live Birth) to SERVE you the \"spoliated owner\" to obtain indemnity for all claims against the fictitious commercial Name that the STATE became owner of by way of their Military SEIZURE and now the holder in due course of the original TITLE to that Private Property Name.\n\nIf the owner has not fled, the commanding officer will cause receipts to be given, which may serve the spoliated owner to obtain indemnity.\n\nThis seizure of ALL PROPERTY is also confirmed in their Senate records.\n\nSenate Doc #43, page 9, second paragraph in the right column.\n\"The ultimate ownership of all property is in the State; individual so-called \"ownership\" is only by virtue of Government, i.e., law, amounting to mere user; and use must be in accordance  with law and subordinate to the necessities of the State.\"\n\nWe as a \"private man\" have NOTHING to do with the Name Trust/Estate. We are NOT an Executor, Administrator, Trustee, Beneficiary or Surety for that Name. We as a \"private man\" have been SPOLIATED by their having seized all our Private Property under their declared State of Emergency via their War Powers.\n\nOur ONLY recourse is to use the RECEIPT they issued to us to SERVE us as \"spoliated owner\" to obtain indemnity.\n\nThis is also why there is NO MONEY for us to use. What can we possibly have any use of money for if EVERYTHING is all vested in the STATE? This is why they removed all money from the private sector under executive order and replaced it with their INTERNAL CURRENCY.\n\nEVERYTHING we had and acquire is all taken by the STATE via their seizure of the Private Property Name the STATE holds original TITLE to, and everything acquired by that Name automatically becomes property of that Name which automatically becomes property vested in the STATE by way of the STATE being holder of the TITLE to that Name.\n\nRather than go to war against the STATE by being a resistor against their foreign military occupation and seizure of all Private Property and being deemed a belligerent, instead, go to PEACE by acknowledging they have seized all property by letting it all go (peaceful surrender) where the STATE now becomes liable for all claims against the Name they hold TITLE to.",
