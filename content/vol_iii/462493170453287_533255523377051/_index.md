   "message": "QUESTION: Civil Code of Quebec ( I know it's boring to discuss this but I'm IN Quebec)\n\nArticle 397. A spouse who enters into a contract for the current needs of the family also binds the other spouse for the whole, if they are not separated from bed and board.\n\nHowever, the non-contracting spouse is not liable for the debt if he or she had previously informed the other contracting party of his or her unwillingness to be bound.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nQUESTION:So if my WIFE publish a Notarized LEGAL NOTICE in the newspaper saying that she has NOTHING TO DO with ANY of commercial stuff I'm contracting in, that should be enough for her to NOT suffer from my DECISIONS for my PERSON ?\n\nThanks\nPierre",
