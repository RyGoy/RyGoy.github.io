   "message": "A judgment nunc pro tunc is an action by a trial court correcting a clerical (rather than judicial) error in a prior judgment. A nunc pro tunc may be signed even after the trial court loses its plenary power. For appellate purposes, a nunc pro tunc judgment correctly taken ordinarily does not extend appellate deadlines.",
