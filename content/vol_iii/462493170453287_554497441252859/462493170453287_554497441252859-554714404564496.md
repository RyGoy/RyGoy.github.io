   "message": "I'd like to but every time I try to fight this my blood pressure goes ballistic and I am in a rage. This condition is being part of my brain injury. It is one of the symptoms. You see a brain injury has certain symptoms, one being an inability to handle stress. I will try sometime soon but today is not a good day for me. Every piece of paper to me is a mental torment, and it is this stress and torment that hinders me. Of course WSIB knows this. This is how they abuse injured workers. You see you guys think it is a level playing field and it is not. There will never be any justice for me or others in the system until that clause in the workers compensation acts of each Province is completely removed. They just keep coming up with excuses to deny claims. Even if you go to court and win hands down they will not pay and you have to appeal again until you get in court again. Then they will not pay again based on another excuse. It is happening everywhere. Very few of us get jstice. Most of us get dead.",
