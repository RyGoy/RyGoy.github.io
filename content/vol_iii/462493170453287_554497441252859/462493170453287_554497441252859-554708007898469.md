   "message": "I want to expose the government for discrimination and neglect. That is one thing for sure. Maybe other things like get the compensation I was promised so I can get well and back to work. That would be nice. But I figure I won't be around much longer. You have no idea what these Nazi's are doing to me and other injured workers. Gang stalking is one of their activities and bullying and intimidating me to shut up. all government agents involved in this. Either they do the crimes against me, or they ignore the crimes against me. It is a government run system and even Human Rights agencies will not hear my pleas for help or justice.",
