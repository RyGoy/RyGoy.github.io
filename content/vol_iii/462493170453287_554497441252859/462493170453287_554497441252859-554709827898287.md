   "message": "It is written in the Act what I am supposed to get. Just like the fact they put a check in the bank and in the Act that was an illegal activity. A person cannot make a decision when unconscious and doped up on morphine. This is my point. It does not matter what is in the act because the only thing WCB looks at is the fact you have lost your legal rights. They can do whatever they want including murder and government has given them a \"get out of jail free\" card by removing a persons legal rights through Workers Compensation Acts.",
