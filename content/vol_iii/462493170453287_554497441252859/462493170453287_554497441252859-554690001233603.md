   "message": "I have two birth certificates Derek. The first one when I was born in a home for unwed mothers. That one my mom signed and gave me a name. I have never seen it and cannot get it but I know the Salvation army has it. My biological Mother won't let me have it. When I was adopted two months later they created a new baptism and birth certificate with a new name. This happens a lot to adopted people.",
