   "message": "Funny you talk about forms and such. I never once filled out a form for WSIB/WCB. NEVER! All I did was accept their offer after being bullied and confused and harassed by them. On the phone when I tried to send the third check back. Here is another point I would like to bring up. Even though I did not willingly sign any of my rights away and they were taken by deceit and fraud and coercion, I have repeatedly stated for 34 years I am being robbed and do not accept their offer anymore because of their criminal activities against me. IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY I WOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO TO COURT WHEN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AGAINST ME HAS been proven. Unfortunately our Nazi government has blocked that avenue by taking away ALL injured workers legal rights. So they promise you this and that but give you nothing but welfare and a life of pain and suffering. That is their plan. They hope to kill as many disabled people as they can, and it is getting worse for injured workers every day. Population control I suspect.",
