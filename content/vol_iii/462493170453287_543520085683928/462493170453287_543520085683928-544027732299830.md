   "message": "Thanks for the questions Max!  This is just Scotts \"give in lieu of identification\" Notice that I updated should I need it!  I figure its better to be ready than scramble.  This is for Mass.\n\n1. I am separating myself from the PUBLIC PERSON.\n2. The clubhouse rules are to show them that I am the only person with authority to choose to act as the PERSON.  ie, they cannot demand me to do it.\n3.  I would stand my ground.  Its gonna be pretty easy since I have no government ID.  :-)  They want me to be someone they can bully, I refuse.  It already started on that last Citation I was issued.  (They wrote down my name and FORMER DL #.  They noted it was \"Susp\".  Evidence of no contract!)\n4.  David was mentioning having the document Apostilled.  I am vaguely familiar with this.  It seems to me that the number 1 purpose of having a document Apostilled is to fOR THE PERSON REQUESTING it....to show them the AUTHORITY of the document.  I agreed with him, although I have no expience with it, so I figured I would ask and see if anyone else had any experience with it.....",
