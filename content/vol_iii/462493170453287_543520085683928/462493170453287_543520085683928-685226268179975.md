   "message": "Apostilles are NOT hard to get from the State.  You can tell them you are traveling to Britain.  They do NOT put that information on your document,  so, if they ask what foreign country you are traveling to, just tell them the UK.\n\nThey were correct when they \"sent it back\"  when you requested the U.S. as a \"foreign\" country.  The Corporate State you are ASKING to Apostille and Certify/Acknowledge the document for your  PERSON, IS the UNITED STATES.",
