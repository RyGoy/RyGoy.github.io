   "message": "again its the enforcement, superior presumption in the face of our lack of fact and/or ability. i imagine it like being caught up in a large crowd exiting a football stadium tunnel, with very little effort you move along with the crowd, try to stop is more effort & you are still swept along, turning & moving against the crowd takes real effort & will. all men are capable of being eachother its just a matter of experiences & will, we're all made of the same stuff? what is it in our psyche makes us play these almost default settings/ roles when anything is possible..running at idle.... :O ... = weed/sleep deprivation haha i have a point here somewhere? yeah social contract is the heroin, in the short term it stops you getting sick but in the long term is it really gonna make you better?? junkies here refer to it as their medicine, their sad delusion is their undoing. the state hooks you up early, makes it easy & routine. mundane makes us docile, everybody else is doing it, its easy... yeah back to caught up in the football crowd & being dragged along. Birth registrations?.I have a 17 yr old daughter so it doesn't sit easy with me,with puppy dog eyes i followed every order unquestionably, look everyone I'M DOING EXACTLY WHATS EXPECTED OF ME (y)",
