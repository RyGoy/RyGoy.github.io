   "message": "I raised this question at TTFL regarding a parallel of the USA not wanting to relinquishing their powers over the rest of the world, similarly, we humans don't want to relinquish our inalienable rights to a social contract we-ourselves had not endorsed wittingly.\n\nThe USA conditionally joined with reservations at the onset and signing of the contract.\n\nParents unknowingly contract on the child's behalf, without any conditional reservations, not understanding the full implications and requirements of said contract. When we use this \"birth certificate\" improperly, we solidify the contract and in doing so, opt out of our inalienable rights to remain as a \"child\" under god and the care of the state.\n\nHow far off am I so far?",
