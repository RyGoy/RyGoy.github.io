   "message": "For me.... i hate pretentious crap & people, Scott isn't \"selling\" me anything, he's not \"massaging things into me, he's not trying to win me over with charm. I've found him hugely respectful, he is extremely responsible with the dissemination of information, he doesn't beat about the bush, he fucks the facts out onto the table & tells you \"FUCKIN DEAL WITH IT\" there is natural selection in his method because he makes you think for yourself (difficult) you pick up & use pieces as you become competent enough not because the rest of the class is & turns out you are lost.... I do enjoy the rants & his unique humour, he challenges me like no other (Y)",
