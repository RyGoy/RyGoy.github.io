He looked it up and said \"Yeah, it was around the Great Depression, i am sure it was to back the money.\" So I said \"Then why isn't it backed by gold today.\" And he replied.....and I am quoting, \"I haven't figured that out yet, but I am sure it was for the common good.\"\n\nThe majority will be arguing indefinitely!!!  :-D",
