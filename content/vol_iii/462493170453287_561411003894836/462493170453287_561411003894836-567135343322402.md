The simplest way is to go to the Accuracy Center and select the \"Add a list of words to your vocabulary\" option.\n[Or as Jomark suggests go to DragonBar|Words|Import]\nHelp on \"Preparing a list of words to add to your vocabulary\" gives full details!\nCreate a file with each of your words on a separate line. If you need to have a spoken form and a written form type the written form followed by a backslash (\\) and then the spoken form. Save the list as a .TXT document.\nYou should create a Windows folder for word lists and other important documents relevant to creating a new user in Dragon.  That way you can access the files when/if you need to create a brand new user or when you update to the next Dragon version.\nGo to the Accuracy Center and follow the instructions for \"Add a list of words to your vocabulary\".\nQuote: http://www.knowbrainer.com/forums/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=4&threadid=10043",
