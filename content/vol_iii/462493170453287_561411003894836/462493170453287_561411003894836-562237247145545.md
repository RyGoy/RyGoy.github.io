   "message": "I may suffer from multi personality disorder because they spell my name differant ways and I use differant names for special purposes (It keeps the police confused), I am here to observe and gather more tools. My friend would like to come to this site, but he does have an imaginary friend and a special pen. I told him Scott may be able to deal with the special pen with the purple ink part but he would not allow him with his imaginary friend. I put up with his imaginary friend because he does have other redeming qualities and never a dull moment. it's been very exciting to see him piss off most agencies, cops and have judges screaming with \"hair on fire\" in the fake court with no flag. If the \"peace officers\" engage him it usually involves traffic being shut down, more police back up, cars with lights and sireins, a fire truck paramedic and an ambulance.....Oh and in the states someone resigns...But  we have had enough fun here in British Columbia and would like to return to home - California(seeing as we have done our damage here and worn out our welcome) So if anyone has any tips on crossing the border....Without Their corporation card \"passport\".methods??He was denied entry to the US, but we don't really want to go to THAT one anyway..",
