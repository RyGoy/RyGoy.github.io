   "message": "Scott Duncan - Do you have any revealing tidbits of info to share about the TTFL membership? For example, it would be interesting to know just how many government agents are here as compared with Dean's page, or ChiefRock's. Do you know if you are trolled more or less than them? I suspect more -at least a greater % as I assume they find you to be a greater (potential and therefore real) threat.",
