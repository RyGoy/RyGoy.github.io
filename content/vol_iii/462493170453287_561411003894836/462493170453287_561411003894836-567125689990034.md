   "message": "That's because it IS the Scott Duncan group. It's what gives it the VALUE.\n\nComments are removed if they distract from the main post. I of course, am not bound by such rules.\n\nI made no claims about being a \"nice guy\". I have absolutely NO \"respect for your beliefs\" because the nobility PUT those beliefs there, and in that regard, you just have no secrets to tell.\n\nYour opinions are simply unqualified, and the rules apply to everyone else. Not me.\n\nJust like in real life. :D\n\nI won't LIE or charge money. Those are your \"rights\" and I CHOOSE to grant them at my whim... Just like real life.\n\nI and my girls may post as much bullshit as we collectively see fit.\n\nYou are here because I know more than you, and you serve my agenda. I did not \"invite\" ANY of you. I even CLOSED THE GROUP.\n\nNone of these things are surprises. You accept these policies from the Government all the time so you SHOULD be used to it.\n\nThe default answers to the preceding questions is \"Because fuck off, that's why\". It's a tried-and-true policy that has served me very well to this point.\n\nThat's why it's the only useful group on facebook.",
