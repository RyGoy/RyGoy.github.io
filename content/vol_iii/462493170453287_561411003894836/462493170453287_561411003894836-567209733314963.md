   "message": "they want to attach liability to that name, without that name you dont appear on their system. i like the i am the man that was arrested/stopped who are YOU line, when he identifies himself (he may not) they still need a valid cause of action to interfere with you. If he refuses to identify himself, he has committed the offence, if he cannot validate his interference... he has committed a crime, but these crimes go un-noticed, un-expressed. \"The case is not about the facts its only about the facts as pleaded\" so our side of the story/fact is never relevent. I've seen people being done for resisting arrest.... even though there was no reason for the arrest, the justice will ignore & prosecute whats put in front of him. So i suppose in this instance its all about making your facts relevent. law is evidential & legal to my understanding & they presume the evidential & focus on the legal.",
