   "message": "No question its worth paying attention.\n\nBut most of this stuff is so contrived and convoluted, I feel like I never make any headway.\n\nAnd whenever I actually do feel like my understanding has improved, even slightly, the next thing I read shatters it all.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the information is spread out across loads of facebook posts and their comments.\n\nIts all very frustrating. And its also the kind of thing that most people will NEVER be able to deal with.\n\nNo one else in my family is ever going to spend hours and hours combing through facebook posts and comments trying to piece together how bits of our system works.\n\nI do understand the whole 'due diligence' deal. But that doesn't mean that we can't make it easier for them.\n\nSeems pretty obvious to me that if we don't, they simply won't. And that costs us all.",
