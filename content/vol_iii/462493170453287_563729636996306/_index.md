   "message": "A friend of mine,his daughter started a small fire in his backyard, it spred and some DNR land caught fire, very small 1-2 acres, now they sent him a Bill for $10,000.00 he called me wondering what to do. I said write a letter Conditionally Accepting their offer to Contract with these stipulations! Swear\n out an Affidavit under Penalty of Perjury(all truth is spoken in affidavit form) Produce a wet ink Contract that was signed between them, if you cannot do this, your offer to contract is rejected!!! Any thoughts!?",
