   "message": "That was great Leigh OftheHouseof Collins. Too bad you didn't void it. Now that would have been priceless to see. I know that when I went to the court house I asked to see the original order. The clerk brought the whole file out and started digging out the original, she asked me if I wanted to see the original order or the one of force and effect? And I took a gamble and said that I wanted to see the one in force and effect. I also had sent back to the court house copies of the last order that was in force in effect but not before I made  photocopies of the last couple of pages so that I would have a record of what I sent back. So now if they come out with a new last page I have proof that the order was tampered with.",
