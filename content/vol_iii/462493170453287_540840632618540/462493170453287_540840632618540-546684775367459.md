   "message": "That is why you can't believe what they tell you. I just went into the courthouse today and tried again to get another certified copy of my family court order, other clerk tried to hand me the previously copied court order stamped true certified and I told her after looking at the last page that it is not the true certified copy. Any ways I told her if you don't want me to charge you too, then I would not hand it out. She took it back right away.",
