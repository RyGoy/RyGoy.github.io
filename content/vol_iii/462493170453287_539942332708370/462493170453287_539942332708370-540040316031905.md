   "message": "It's one way to get the politicians back to work...oh yeah, and reawaken the mail order porn industry, pushing the child sex trafficking & human slavery trades back underground & off the mainstream radar so the politicians can say they tackled the tough issues...\n\nNow, how do they then funnel the extra revenue generated into bitcoin, thus further attempting to demonise crypto-currencies, then make all users of crypto currencies criminals by association?\n\nThere are sooooo many agendas that can be fed by doing this.",
