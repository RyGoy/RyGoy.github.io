   "message": "-�I would see this as the next step and it just goes along with what we have been trying to do for some time.�\n-�David Cameron declared war on child pornography and it�s a really good first step.�\n\nShe says it twice \"step\"...\nWhat other conclusion is one to make?\n\"Tories\" intend on meddling with the internet and even more freedoms. For that reason alone, I reject this policy.\n\nBelievers \"presume\" way too much and there are other ways to prevent child pornography without overstepping those boundaries, infringing and inconveniencing a large demographic.\n\nPersonally, I think they are targeting the Sharing community and this is a foot-in-the-door.",
