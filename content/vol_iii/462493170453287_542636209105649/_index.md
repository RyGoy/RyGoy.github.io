   "message": "WOw cops killing a 18yr old, on youtube, a murder on youtube...like that old video that shows people getting killed. You dont see him die but you hear the gun shots, i guess that is what happens when you bring a knife to a gun fight with Police ? Instead of shooting to incapacitate you they shoot to kill you ? How does that work? shoot in leg or something so they cant stand or shoot in to death so he cant live ? Anyways have a look...\n",
