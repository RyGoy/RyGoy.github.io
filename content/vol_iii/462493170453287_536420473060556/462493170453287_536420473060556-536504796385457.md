   "message": "Your man is in jail because he doesn't know who he is.\nOr perhaps because he got close to getting it right.\n\nUnlawful forced incarceration should never be seen as proof that those with a monopoly of force and an entire establishment of corrupt sell outs and legal trapdoors were in the right.\n\nQuite the oppposite, but most who foul it up.are usually confused from the start, it only takes one unexpected move from the deceivers and their philosophy is floundering.\nIt's a game. \nThe trick is learning how not to play without having to move back to the stone age to be free of harrasment.\n\nP.s. Scott Duncan, typonese, revealed a new term to me today. \nAn oppt mis-spell.\nHarrasment -jarrasment. :)",
