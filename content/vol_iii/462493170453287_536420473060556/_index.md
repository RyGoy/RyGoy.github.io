   "message": "I am a man from Oshawa Ont. Canada.  I am here to learn.  Learn if this stuff  produces results.  If it will be honored by the powers at be.  The only live man I talked to about this in person was showing me about this and he is now in jail.  The concepts seem right to me.  And yet they do not seem to be honored.  I want to live my life free from molestation of government or anyone else.  I want to do no harm or be harmed.  I want to be shown respect from officers of the government.  Nothing special just common curticies.  What I am not is a wanna be marter.  I am not a radical.  I want to be lawful.  If there is a way to avoid fines harassment and disrespect I would be interested in learning.",
