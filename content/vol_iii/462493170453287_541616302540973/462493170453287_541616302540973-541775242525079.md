   "message": "Lovely Pete, good man. I had a pain in arse trying to find it. Thanks Eamonn, I'll have to look into it when i get a chance. You have given me a great head start. \nWhen i was lookin at the Notice of Mistake the other day it was the same. So lots of research ahead. \nI understand it (I think) and, it's a great piece of work from a learned man.\nThanks again Pete your so good. :)",
