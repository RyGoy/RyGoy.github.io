   "message": "Ok. Here goes like a scrotum here it is in a nutshell.\nI, in 2001, went to RMIT to learn about becoming a UNION organiser for the head of the unions body here the ACTU.....Industrial Relations/ Human Resources I studied at university for 6 months. I from many thousands of voices Australia wide defeated politicians, Lawyers & Bankers by being short listed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions from over 6000 potential voices to lead a massive workforce. I lost the job because they asked me to LIE & tell them that I had a child I didn't have.\nI didnt LIE.\nI lost a child just previous to my ex but she was sacfificed to a Sky Daddy without my consent & an ex hit man for the Vic Police Force tried to kill me in PUBLIC TO SHUT ME UP.............the ACTU were too scared of my Voice & my Heart & Love for everyone & everything. My voice alone made the Vic Police Force sit up & become accountable for their lack of INTEGRITY & HONESTY whilst working for the global Crown POstal Office. Many Police high up the food chain do actually on the PRIVATE SIDE Indorse this lil monster of their own creation.\nThis is Why I'm here. Scott & Tara.....THANK YOU....For getting me thus far.\nAQUILLAE OR BUST !!\nPeace & Love to ALL.",
