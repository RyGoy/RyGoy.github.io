   "message": "For this bit: \"As the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) has been deposited into the COURT [In the custody of Justice Wailan Low, ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE: Court File Number CV-11-430464], WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I, as a MAN who is not lawfully entitled to the BENEFITS of a BIRTH CERTIFICATE [PPSACA13078], have any SURETY in this matter?\"\n\nDoes it mean that a copy of the BC has been put in the court file? And the last line, would this mean that one shouldn't be receiving benefits or is it rather saying, the flesh and blood, as opposed to the NAME, is not entitled?",
