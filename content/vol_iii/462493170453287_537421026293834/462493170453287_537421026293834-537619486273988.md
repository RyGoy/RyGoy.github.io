   "message": "Kevin in the notice Scott is referring to a copy of the BC he gave to the court for dispositioning (transferring of property). Once you give the BC to the court it is then in the custody of the court and they now possess it. They can then do what they want with the person. If you don't possess something you don't control it.\n\nWith regards to benefits that's a tricky one. The maxim, \"He who receives the benefit must accept the burden\" always stands. \n\nHowever, Scott has shown us that whenever new charges are filed a brand new person is created. The prosecuting party then attempt to attach surety to you for the new charges and person. So I'm not sure what bearing receiving benefits would have on any new claims filed...\n\nThe Kevin Flanagan on your driving license isn't the Kevin Flanagan on the passport. The Kevin Flanagan on your social services card isn't the Kevin Flanagan on the Garda charge sheet... ;)",
