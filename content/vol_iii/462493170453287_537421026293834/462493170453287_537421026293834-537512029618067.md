   "message": "Yes as Scott Duncan always says. UNDERSTAND the WORDS that is used in that NOTICE OF MISTAKE.\n\nScott designed that to be generic because he knew that not everyone would be able to design their own notice so therefor he gave a dumbed down version for people to begin their quest....well thats my assumption.\n\nI used it and fully understood it, and it worked overwhelmingly. Same with the help that he gave with VOIDing. Scott is most certainly one of the no bullshitters out in the cyber world.\n\nUNDERSTAND the terms he used, when you feel you got the picture you can use it for your own purposes. You WILL BE TESTED!!!",
