Those holding Federal or State public office, county or municipal office, under the Legislative, Executive or Judicial branch, including Court Officials, Judges, Prosecutors, Law Enforcement Department employees, Officers of the Court, and etc., before entering into these public offices, are required by the U.S. Constitution and statutory law to comply with Title 5 USC, Sec. �3331, \"Oath of office.\" State Officials are also required to meet this same obligation, according to State Constitutions and State statutory law.\n\n2. All oaths of office come under 22 CFR, Foreign Relations, Sections ��92.12 -92.30, and all who hold public office come under Title 8 USC, Section �1481 \"Loss of nationality by native-born or naturalized citizen; voluntary action; burden of proof; presumptions.\"\n\n3. Under Title 22 USC, Foreign Relations and Intercourse, Section �611, a Public Official is considered a foreign agent. In order to hold public office, the candidate must file a true and complete registration statement with the State Attorney General as a foreign principle.\n\n4. The Oath of Office requires the public official in his / her foreign state capacity to uphold the constitutional form of government or face consequences.\n\nTitle 10 USC, Sec. �333, \"Interference with State and Federal law\"\n\nThe President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy, if it�\n\n(1) so hinders the execution of the laws of that State, and of the United States within the State, that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right, privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or (2) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\n\nIn any situation covered by clause (1), the State shall be considered to have denied the equal protection of the laws secured by the Constitution.\n\n5. Such willful action, while serving in official capacity, violates Title 18 USC, Section �1918:\n\nTitle 18 USC, Section �1918 \"Disloyalty and asserting the right to strike against the government\"\n\nWhoever violates the provision of 7311 of title 5 that an individual may not accept or hold a position in the Government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia if he�\n\n(1) advocates the overthrow of our constitutional form of government; (2) is a member of an organization that he knows advocates the overthrow of our constitutional form of government;\n\nshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year and a day, or both.\n\nand also deprives claimants of \"honest services:\n\nTitle 18, Section �1346. Definition of \"scheme or artifice to defraud\"\n\n\"For the purposes of this chapter, the term \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\n\nISSUE TWO: JUDGE SERVES AS A DEBT COLLECTOR\n\n6. Judges hold public office under Title 28 USC, Chapter 176, Federal Debt Collection Procedure:\n\nTitle 28, Chapter 176, Federal Debt Collection Procedure, Section �3002\n\nAs used in this chapter:\n\n(2) \"Court\" means any court created by the Congress of the United States, excluding the United States Tax Court. (3) \"Debt\" means�\n\n(A) an amount that is owing to the United States on account of a direct loan, or loan insured or guaranteed, by the United States; or (B) an amount that is owing to the United States on account of a fee, duty, lease, rent, service, sale of real or personal property, overpayment, fine, assessment, penalty, restitution, damages, interest, tax, bail bond forfeiture, reimbursement, recovery of a cost incurred by the United States, or other source of indebtedness to the United States, but that is not owing under the terms of a contract originally entered into by only persons other than the United States;\n\n(8) \"Judgment\" means a judgment, order, or decree entered in favor of the United States in a court and arising from a civil or criminal proceeding regarding a debt. (15) \"United States\" means�\n\n(A) a Federal corporation; (B) an agency, department, commission, board, or other entity of the United States; or (C) an instrumentality of the United States.\n\nTitle 22 USC, Sec. �286. \"Acceptance of membership by United States in International Monetary Fund,\" states the following:\n\nThe President is hereby authorized to accept membership for the United States in the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as the \"Fund\"), and in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (hereinafter referred to as the \"Bank\"), provided for by the Articles of Agreement of the Fund and the Articles of Agreement of the Bank as set forth in the Final Act of the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference dated July 22, 1944, and deposited in the archives of the Department of State.\n\n8. Title 22 USC, Sec. � 286e-13, \"Approval of fund pledge to sell gold to provide resources for Reserve Account of Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Trust,\" states the following:\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to instruct the Fund's pledge to sell, if needed, up to 3,000,000 ounces of the Fund's gold, to restore the resources of the Reserve Account of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Trust to a level that would be sufficient to meet obligations of the Trust payable to lenders which have made loans to the Loan Account of the Trust that have been used for the purpose of financing programs to Fund members previously in arrears to the Fund.\n\nISSUE THREE: NO IMMUNITY UNDER \"COMMERCE\"\n\n9. All immunity of the United States, and all liability of States, instrumentalities of States, and State officials have been waived under commerce, according to the following US Codes:\n\nTitle 15 USC, Commerce, Sec. �1122, \"Liability of States, instrumentalities of States, and State officials\"\n\n(a) Waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States. The United States, all agencies and instrumentalities thereof, and all individuals, firms, corporations, other persons acting for the United States and with the authorization and consent of the United States, shall not be immune from suit in Federal or State court by any person, including any governmental or nongovernmental entity, for any violation under this Act. (b) Waiver of sovereign immunity by States. Any State, instrumentality of a State or any officer or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State acting in his or her official capacity, shall not be immune, under the eleventh amendment of the Constitution of the United States or under any other doctrine of sovereign immunity, from suit in Federal court by any person, including any governmental or nongovernmental entity for any violation under this Act.\n\nTitle 42 USC, Sec. �12202, \"State immunity\"\n\nA State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter. In any action against a State for a violation of the requirements of this chapter, remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) are available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in an action against any public or private entity other than a State\n\nTitle 42 USC, Sec. �2000d�7, \"Civil rights remedies equalization\"\n\n(a) General provision\n\n(1) A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 794], title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 [20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.], the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 [42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.], title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.], or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance. (2) In a suit against a State for a violation of a statute referred to in paragraph (1), remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) are available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State.\n\n10. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 gives immunity in Administrative Court to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) only when an action is brought by the people against a public, agency or corporate official /department. Under Title 5 USC, Commerce, public offices or officials can be sanctioned.\n\nTitle 5, USC, Sec. �551:\n\n(10) \"sanction\" includes the whole or a part of an agency�\n\n(A) prohibition, requirement, limitation, or other condition affecting the freedom of a person;(B) withholding of relief;(C) imposition of penalty or fine;(D) destruction, taking, seizure, or withholding of property;(E) assessment of damages, reimbursement, restitution, compensation, costs, charges, or fees;(F) requirement, revocation, or suspension of a license; or\n\n(G) taking other compulsory or restrictive action;\n\n11. Justice is required to be BLIND while holding a SET OF SCALES and a TWO-EDGED SWORD. This symbolizes true justice. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (60 stat 237) would allow the sword to cut in either direction and give the judge immunity by holding his own court office accountable for honest service fraud, obstruction of justice, false statements, malicious prosecution and fraud placed upon the court. Any willful intent to uncover the EYES OF JUSTICE or TILT THE SCALES is a willful intent to deny Due Process, which violates Title 18 USC �1346, \"Scheme or Artifice to Defraud,\" by perpetrating a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services. This is considered fraud and an overthrow of a constitutional form of government and the person depriving the honest service can be held accountable and face punishment under Title 18 USC and Title 42 USC and violates Title 28 USC judicial procedures.\n\n12. Both Title 18 USC, Crime and Criminal Procedure, and Title 42 USC, Public Health and Welfare, allow the Petitioner to bring an action against the United States and/or the State agencies, departments, and employees for civil rights violations while dealing in commerce. Title 10 places all public officials under this Title10 section 333 while under a state of emergency. (Declare or undeclared War this fall under TWEA.)\n\nISSUE FOUR:\n\nCOURTS OPERATING UNDER WAR POWERS ACT\n\n13. The Courts are operating under the Emergency War Powers Act. The country has been under a declared \"state of emergency\" for the past 70 years resulting in the Constitution being suspended (See Title 50 USC Appendix � Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917). The Courts have been misusing Title 50 USC, Sec. �23, \"Jurisdiction of United States courts and judges,\" which provides for criminal jurisdiction over an \"enemy of the state,\" whereas, Petitioner comes under Title 50 USC Appendix Application Sec. �21, \"Claims of naturalized citizens as affected by expatriation\" which states the following:\n\nThe claim of any naturalized American citizen under the provisions of this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix] shall not be denied on the ground of any presumption of expatriation which has arisen against him, under the second sentence of section 2 of the Act entitled \"An Act in reference to the expatriation of citizens and their protection abroad,\" approved March 2, 1907, if he shall give satisfactory evidence to the President, or the court, as the case may be, of his uninterrupted loyalty to the United States during his absence, and that he has returned to the United States, or that he, although desiring to return, has been prevented from so returning by circumstances beyond his control.\n\n14. 15 Statutes at Large, Chapter 249 (section 1), enacted July 27 1868, states the following:\n\nPREAMBLE - Rights of American citizens in foreign states.\n\nWHEREAS the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and whereas in the recognition of this principle this government has freely received emigrants from all nations, and invested them with the rights of citizenship; and whereas it is claimed that such American citizens, with their descendants, are subjects of foreign states, owing allegiance to the governments thereof; and whereas it is necessary to the maintenance of public peace that this claim of foreign allegiance should be promptly and finally disavowed.\n\nSECTION I - Right of expatriation declared.\n\nTHEREFORE, Be it enacted by the Senate of the and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That any declaration, instruction, opinion, order, or decision of any officers of this government which denies, restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation, is hereby declared inconsistent with the fundamental principles of this government.\n\nSECTION II - Protection to naturalized citizens in foreign states.\n\nAnd it is further enacted, That all naturalized citizens of the United States, while in foreign states, shall be entitled to, and shall receive from this government, the same protection of persons and property that is accorded to native born citizens in like situations and circumstances. SECTION III - Release of citizens imprisoned by foreign governments to be demanded.\n\nAnd it is further enacted, That whenever it shall be made known to the President that any citizen of the United States has been unjustly deprived of his liberty by or under the authority of any foreign government, it shall be the duty of the President forthwith to demand of that government the reasons for such imprisonment, and if it appears to be wrongful and in the violation of the rights of American citizenship, the President shall forthwith demand the release of such citizen, and if the release so demanded is unreasonably delayed or refused, it shall be the duty of the President to use such means, not amounting to acts of war, as he may think necessary and proper to obtain or effectuate such release, and all the facts and proceedings relative thereto shall as soon as practicable be communicated by the President to Congress.\n\nApproved, July 27, 1868\n\n15. The Courts and the States are enforcing the following code on American nationals: Title 50 USC Appendix App, Trading, Act, Sec. �4, \"Licenses to enemy or ally of enemy insurance or reinsurance companies; change of name; doing business in United States,\" as a result of the passage of The Amendatory Act of March 9, 1933 to Title 50 USC, Trading with the Enemy Act Public Law No. 65-91 (40 Stat. L. 411) October 6, 1917. The original Trading with the Enemy Act excluded the people of the United States from being classified as the enemy when involved in transactions wholly within the United States. The Amendatory Act of March 9, 1933, however, included the people of the United States as the enemy, by incorporating the following language into the Trading With The Enemy Act: \"by any person within the United States.\" The abuses perpetrated upon the American people are the result of Title 50 USC, Trading With The Enemy Act, which turned the American people into \"enemy of the state.\"",
