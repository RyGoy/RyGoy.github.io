   "message": "Basically the difference between the two should be the difference between private and public, however with the introduction of fiat currency in 1933'ish there is no longer the ability to PAY a debt with substance - Public policy HJR 192. So you got funny money, paper debt instruments and digital digits on a screen all representing accounts, accounting, money of account. Then you got the mafia monopoly of legal tender as so-called money of exchange, however anything can be used as a medium of exchange if the bridge of consent/agreement is crossed/created:-)",
