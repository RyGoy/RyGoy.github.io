   "message": "From BoE: \"A Promissory Note is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain IN MONEY, to, or to the order of, a specified person, or to bearer.\" [My emphasis].\nI am stuck here. If money (lik a $10 blll) is a promise to pay (representing somene's debt, and they promised they'd pay) then a promisary note can only get you another promise. \nAmI missing the boat completly?",
