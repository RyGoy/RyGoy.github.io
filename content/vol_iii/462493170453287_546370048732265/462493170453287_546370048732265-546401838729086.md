   "message": "it's all about concessions isn't it? You exchange freedom for convenience. We take the benefits Caesar has to offer because it's easier for us to do so. What symbol is on the front of your passport? Mine's a Harp. Think of the 'power' that symbol has. It might be the same symbol that appears on the top of a court summons, your licence, and so on. Think how you 'feel' when a letter comes in the door with that symbol on it demanding you to go to court. Is it a symbol of freedom? No. Is it a symbol of bondage? It must be, even in a very technical sense because it signifies your connection with, your bond, your association and your bondage with the 'State authority'.",
