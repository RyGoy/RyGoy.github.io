I wish you well, be safe. :(\nEven if one gets \"money\" out of this unfortunate situation, what a drag having to live our lifes suing public officials, and begging our rapists to give us \"remedy.\" Most harm is done already. You, and your family have suffered already.\n\nI wonder if we should be careful NOT to post in the public/Internet what we are doing  and/or planning to do with current ongoing cases. I myself have taken that precaution very seriously. I guess untill thetenderforlaw website is up and running, we have a limitation of exposure. I myself have been ready to leave facebook, but haven't done it to not loose contact with Scott, and TTFL.\n\nWe have cops here, after Dean Kory,  and now Derek,  is more than evident. I know good guys don't hide, but we don't have to let them know a step-by-step guide of what we are doing and/or planning to do with our persons's cases.\n\nIs just a suggestion. I wish Derek, and everybody here, to be well and safe!",
