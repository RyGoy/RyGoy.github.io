The average time in a detention centre is 30 days. Your imaginary gay-fantasy  if \"prison frat initiation\" is just bullshit. \"Kick his legs\" is not any sort of initiation I've ever heard of, and they don't want you to be \"part of their club\".\n\nSeriously. Shut up now. Lies waste my time, and everyone else's.",
