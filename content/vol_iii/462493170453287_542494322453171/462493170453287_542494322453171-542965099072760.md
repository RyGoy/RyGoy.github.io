   "message": "I get it. That is why I have chosen to trade my time mostly to those I can TRUST. I was just verifying something I had thought. I was trying to explain it to some one else too and didn't want to give wrong information. Even if I do \"perform\" for some one I don't TRUST, I set very simple terms verbally and can simply walk away when/if they prove to be dishonourable towards me. I never call on any one else to enforce my terms either.",
