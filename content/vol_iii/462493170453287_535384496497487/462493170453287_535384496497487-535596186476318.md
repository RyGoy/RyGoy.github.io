I have a mental block which is a real pain.\nI try to put things into Simple Stupid.(then I can understand them)\nSo I see it as simple as by using the Government \"TITLES\" and just simple doing what they tell us to do is just BECOMING one of them.\nSo...just stop doing it and put the allegiance back where it can do good as a SUBJECT instead of a CITIZEN.\nOr am I really fucked in the head?",
