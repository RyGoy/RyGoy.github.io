   "message": "Ok I want to do a status post, but want to make sure that all info is accurate, Scott Duncan \n\nREAL TALK:\n\nWe are contributing to the creation/progression of our own slavery. We call out to Queen Elizabeth to help, but OUR actions have tied her hands. WE buy into fraud daily by accepting we are the PERSON our birth certificate represents. Our signature is not on our Birth Certificate, therefore we do NOT own it. The name on the Birth Certificate represents the PERSON, not us the flesh bearing man and woman. Every piece of legislation, law and statute all relates to the PERSON, not the flesh bearing man and woman. By accepting we are the PERSON, we are disabling any opportunity which may be available to us through the keeper of our trust Queen Elizabeth II of Windsor. Queen Elizabeth II in Right of Canada is a PERSON, not the flesh bearing woman, to accept this created fiction is encouraging fraud on our part .",
