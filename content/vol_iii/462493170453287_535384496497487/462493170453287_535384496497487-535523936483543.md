   "message": "Restoration of RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT <--look that up.\n\nThrough executive order, the government gets overhauled. Worthless paper-pushers would be audited for every penny the signed for. The worst cases will be questioned on state television, and tossed to the angry mob afterward.\n\nThose that survive the purges would be trained in their new mandate, using the harshest methods available... Yes. Chinese Primary School Teachers will be training them...\n\nThe term is for FIVE YEARS, and then the Monarch returns to the CURRENT status. The mandate of the Provost Marshall will be expanded, and the office will provide armed soldiers with shoot-to-kill orders for anyone who might find themselves holding the public trust, but chooses NOT to act in the public's interest.\n\nGovernment workers will be a lot more focused if they have to worry about getting a bullet put in their heads on the way to question period, if they take that $50,000 kickback from RBC.",
