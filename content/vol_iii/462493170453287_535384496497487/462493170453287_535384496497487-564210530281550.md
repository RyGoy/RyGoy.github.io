   "message": "Scott Duncan - I took this oath at 17 when I joined the CAF:  \"I, [name], do swear (or solemnly affirm) that I will well and truly serve Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her heirs and successors according to law, in the Canadian Forces until lawfully released, that I will resist Her Majesty's enemies and cause Her Majesty's peace to be kept and maintained and that I will, in all matters pertaining to my service, faithfully discharge my duty. So help me God\" It seems to me that this oath is still in effect for me as the wording says that I will serve her in the CAF, but, it doesn't say I could stop serving her after I left the military. Am I correct in my understanding in this? If so, it seems I am bound to help you and have no other choice as your plan is the best one presented to me regarding serving the lady with the funny hats. :)",
