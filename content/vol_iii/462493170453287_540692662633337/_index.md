   "message": "A topic that hasnt been explored or applied alot (from my experience) is how to do a WRIT OF HABEUS.\n\nNow its common sense that doing notice of mistake and/or VOIDing orders is going to piss the wrong people off, and you will most likely be spending some time in jail.\n\nBut what if they continue to railroad you, refuse to let you go when you KNOW you are in the right.\n\nWell a writ of habeus may be your lifeline.\n\nWhat is a writ of habeus?\n\nA writ of habeus is a COMMAND to the custodian(jailor/warden/other similar positions of \"power\" to detain a body) of the body in question(which will be you or your friend in which you want out).\n\nYou need to have a few things in it.\n\nThe body you are reffering to, such as \"The body that is mistaken as JOHN DOE\"\nYou need the custodian such as \"WINDSOR POLICE SERVICES\"\nYou need a phrase similar to \"You are COMMANDED to bring forth the body to be questioned on what AUTHORITY you have to detain, blah blah.\"\n\nThis is really all i got so far.....Its up to you guys to post something to help complete this writ.",
