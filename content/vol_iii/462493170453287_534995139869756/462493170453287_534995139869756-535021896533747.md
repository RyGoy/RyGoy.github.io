For grievous harms caused and then met you 2 yahoos ( all due respect).   You kicked my I ass a little on a thread back in February on Deans page I think. \n\n   I asked about mentor ship and teaching and learning....\ni was then invited to the tender for law.  I followed instructions and applied myself. Pointed int the right direction... but how would I know as I value the wrong things....\n\n  The thread was about praecipe (pardon spelling)....\n\nSO...SCOTT DUNCAN SHOWED ME HOW TO BE KING.",
