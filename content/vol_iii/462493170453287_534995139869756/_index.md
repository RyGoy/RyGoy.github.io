   "message": "The \"how to control your case by liening\" thread.\n\nThis is used typically for crown attorney cases, such as criminal proceedings and/or provincial offenses. So, you may have noticed that i speak about objection and standing. There is a reason for that. Lets have a recap on some things before we get into the liening.\n\nWhat would be the account?\n\nWe know how the PROVINCE OF ONTARIO is operated by JUSTICE. This makes or means that the court system as you used to know by is in fact commercial. What does that mean? Well it means that they are a business. What do business have with \"clients\" or \"applicants\" or \"claimants\"? Business accounts. Business accounts => Court file numbers.\n\nWho are we liening?\n\nSo now that we have an account. who do we need to focus our attention towards now. Well who represents the province? who manages the services of the court? The answer is the Attorney General of Ontario.\n\nDescription?\n\nI would probably leave it simple like \"Secured Personal Interest\" Anything more is unnecessary.\n\nCreditor?\n\nIf you have a shell corporation then you would list it as your LLC. If not you simply use your PERSON.\n\nLength or duration?\n\nYou can define whatever length of time you want. conventionally its 8$ per year for 1-25 years or 500$ for forever...I'm not joking...So whatever you feel is necessary.\n\nWhy lien it?\n\nBecause you want all the value. If lets say you have a restraining order. Courts make money off that. When you lien it. They no longer make money. So you can see why they would be encouraged to terminate it.\n\nSo what happens after?\n\nWhen you lien it and perfected it, you therefor control everything in that case. You direct how your case goes.\n\nSo now that you got a basic grasp what now?\n\nWhen you perfect it no one will oppose it(how can they?They are not persons.)If they did not oppose it then they have no standing to speak or direct. See where I'm going? That is why your objections will become infinitely more powerful because you will truly have the only party with standing.\n\nAnyways, I'm sure this covers the basic concepts and benefits of what you can do.",
