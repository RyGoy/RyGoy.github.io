   "message": "Yes. Good for Scott Duncan.\n\nExcept you don't know how to be a King. Scott is your only trustworthy model. You will just clone him. You will do as he does, and you can bend the world to your will.\n\nExcept you still barely know how to be a King by this point. Follow Scott again. After all he gave you all this. It cost you NOTHING, and you feel free for the first time. Why wouldn't you trust a man who gives you so much, and asks for nothing?",
