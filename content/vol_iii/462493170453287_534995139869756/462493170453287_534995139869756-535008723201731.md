   "message": "I filed a lien two days ago on a property. I received a call yesterday morning from a ppsa agent telling me that the ppsa.ca lien service is intended for MOVEABLE items such as boats and cars, and, I would have to file a writ though www.teranet.ca to register a lien on the property. She said I would need a lawyer to file the WRIT. How do I WRITE the WRIT?",
