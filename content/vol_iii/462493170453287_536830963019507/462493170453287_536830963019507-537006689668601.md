   "message": "Whenever I'm contacted by these clowns on the phone (I NEVER call them & never tell them any name), I just tell them that the person they are looking for is not available and business can only be conducted in writing, so if they wish to contact the person in question, ONLY do so in writing, then hang up.\n\nIf they DO contact me in writing, I send them my fee schedule, instructing them that I only deal in writing and, if they want me to engage in business with them, then here are my terms...\n\n(Then offer ridiculous terms that no sane person would accept...after all I'm not an accountant OR a tax lawyer, so how can I possibly do any work they are contacting me about?) :D",
