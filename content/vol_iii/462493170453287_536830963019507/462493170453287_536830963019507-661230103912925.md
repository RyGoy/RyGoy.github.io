   "message": "ChiefRock Sino General\n1 min ï¿½ \nTold CRA, if they want me to volunteer to file tax wont happen but i will invoice you $1000.00 for taking my precious time to do the tax filings for the person owned by Ontario Government. The guys says, well no, we cant pay you for that. I said, well why not, you dont expect me to work for free do you ? after all the SIN number is govt property and not mine, he agrees its not mine but still thinks i should do it because he doesnt get paid to do his. I said,well that sucks on your part cause you got suckered into working for free and/or paying an account xxxx amount to do it for you. So i asked him for his accounts payable dept lol...he didnt know really what to say to me. I wish i recorded it, was classic. He, than goes well your account, i correct him and say, you mean the Govt account, why you do you keep referring me as the owner? He says yes your right.",
