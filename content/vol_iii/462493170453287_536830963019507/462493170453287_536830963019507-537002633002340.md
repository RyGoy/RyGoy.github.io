How to deal with Revenue Canada (currently Canada Revenue Agency)\n\nWhen you de-tax yourself, you can expect that at some point CRA will contact you and demand that you file a tax return.\n\nPlease remember everything that you have learned so far.  They are administering a completely illegal (unconstitutional) piece of legislation.  The only REAL weapon they have is fear, and they use it very well.  I know, I was trained in all their tactics.\n\nNever allow them to intimidate you.\n\nYou must, however, remember that they (they includes CRA, the government, the International Banking Cartel, the Courts and the Police) have everything in place to punish you if you are not prepared.\n\nThe purpose of the Courts, who are paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund (into which your taxes go) of either the provincial or the federal governments, have but one objective�to carry out the agenda of the New World Order through the government.  Admittedly, they may well be unwitting participants in this agenda, but they are participants nonetheless.  \n\nI am certain that most cops think they are actually serving the people.  They are not however, they are enslaving the people and serving the agenda of the New World Order dictatorship (unelected world government).  \n\nTheir objective, for some time now, has not been to administer justice.  Remember, the best description of the current justice system is to call it the �Just Us� system.\n\nHowever, you can very easily deal with CRA - easily, but it requires attention to detail.\n\nAlways be polite, respectful, and accommodating.  Never tell them that you do not intend to file a tax return or pay taxes.  This simply serves to antagonize them and makes you look bad if they ever do take you to Court.  However, if you prepare properly, they will never take you to court, and even if they do they will lose.\n\nThis statement is made �tongue in cheek� as it were.  You must remember that the judges are simply other government agents placed in positions of judgment by the government itself, to judge the governments� laws.  The bias is obvious, but it is a bias that you must keep in mid if you are going to tackle the system.\n\nThe first thing you do is tell them that because of all the horror stories that you have heard about people committing suicide because of the treatment they received from CRA, the alleged violation of citizens rights by CRA, and other reasons, you should do the following:\n\n1. Ask them to provide you with Identification.  This is very reasonable and you should not meet with any resistance.  Each person, if there is more than one, should do this.\n\n2. Ask them which signature is their signature (there will be more than one.  There will be an authorizing signature as well).\n\n3. Next, you should ask who signed as �authorizing signature� or whatever the term is below the other signature(s).\n\n4. Ask who that person is.\n\n5. Ask if you could see the authorization that gives that person authority to sign their ID card.  They will not be able to do this.  But you must insist and tell them that when they get it they can return and you will be happy to accommodate them and assist in any way you are legally obliged to.\n\nThe Minister and/or Deputy Minister must authorize every authority that is delegated.  The Minister or Deputy Minister are the only ones authorized by the income tax Act to do anything.  This authority can be delegated pursuant to section 220 of the Act but there must be evidence of that delegation � in writing.\n\nIf the ID card is signed by the Minister or Deputy Minister, then this part of the Act has been complied with.  However, have you been satisfied that the signature is valid and have you satisfied yourself that the Minister and/or Deputy Minister have sworn an oath of office?\n\n6. If they do not have these documents, i.e. oath of office from the Minister and/or Deputy Minister, then you can demand to see it because it is your right, in order to protect yourself.  You can demand that it be produced in writing.\n\nYou can carry this as far as your imagination will allow you.  You do not have to take any of these steps if you do not feel comfortable.  You must proceed as you feel comfortable in doing.\n\n7. Next, you can tell them that you have been recently informed that the federal income Tax Act is unconstitutional and may not even be an Act of Parliament which satisfies the mandatory rules of the Constitution Act, 1867, for the introduction and passing of Acts of Parliament.\n\nTherefore, you must demand that they provide you with a copy of the statute and it must be the official Act, not a private publishers� version, since such a book could not be used in a court of law (being copyrighted and such).\n\nIf you wish, you could ask them if you are being unreasonable and see what the response is.  Their response can be used later if necessary.  \n\nIf their response is that you are not being unreasonable, then send them away to get the Act for you.  They will never be able to produce it because it does not exist, at least not in a manner that can be produced for you to look at.\n\nIf, however, they respond that you are being unreasonable, then ask them if someone came along and told them that there was a law that required them to do something and they believed that there was no such law, would they not demand that the official law be produced so that they could determine for themselves that there was a legal requirement to do as they were being asked to do?\n\nIt is your absolute right to see the law and the official law not a private publishers� version which is the only thing available in Canada today.  The only Queen�s Printer version (which is still a fraud) available is the 1985 version which has had hundreds of amendments (maybe thousands, depending on when you read this book) since that printing.  The law in Canada demands that the law be fixed and certain and a 1985 version with thousands of amendments contained throughout numerous Bills passed by Parliament over a period of years, is not fixed and certain.  \n\nThey cannot produce a consolidated official version, certified by the Clerk of the Parliaments (as required by the Publication of Statutes Act) of the current income tax Act as amended.  Therefore, by demanding it, as is your right, you will be asking them to do what they cannot do.\n\n8. If the CRA agents survive the challenges to this point (of course they can�t because the Act does not exist), then you can continue by having them explain to you how the Act applies to you, a free man.  I provided you with the definition of free earlier in this book and you may want to review this in order to challenge them with this next step.\n\nSuffice it to say, that they will have trouble and will ultimately simply demand your compliance with their demands.  It is totally up to you what you do at this point.  But let me continue.\n\n9. You could also engage them with demands to have their specific demands in writing and do nothing more than what they ask you to do.  As this process moves ahead, if you are imaginative, you will find other ways to delay them and eventually, they may go away.\n\nRemember, if the agent is spending a lot of time with you and getting nothing in return, he/she will have to answer to his superiors for this lack of return on their invested time.  As long as you do not give them anything that will allow them to take you to court, you will simply be wasting their time and they will eventually go away. \n\nThe list could go on, but you get the idea.",
