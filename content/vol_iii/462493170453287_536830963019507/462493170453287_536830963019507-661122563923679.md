   "message": "Don't be scared of the numbers, Jason Lerato. It's ALL surety, and accounting. If you qualify your role, if you establish who is surety, if you know how to settle the accounting, you should not fear anything. It MUST be VERY simple. \n\nIt's all made to scare, but YOU are NOT responsible for the BILL! You are just responsible for ADMINISTRATING that debt. And you have the INSTRUMENT that gives CONSIDERATION to settle those BILLS. \n\nIt's really not complicated, Jason. Come on, \"Canada\" needs you!",
