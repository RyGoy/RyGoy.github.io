   "message": "What Pete said works. Or also, Jason Lerato, embrace the slave that has been given to you to use.\n\nI think your position is VERY easy to handle, if no other details are involved.\n\nSend a registered mail NOTICE from the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for JASON LERATO to CRA, saying that he will be glad to file for the person, but with the condition that you will not buy back any more public debt for JASON LERATO, but only administrate the debt via the surety. Show them proof of who is surety.\n\nInstruct them to send a bill to the person, and remittance and/or instructions on how to properly fill out the bill of exchange, for proper discharge, and settlement of the account.\n\nIf you do this, there is no controversy, and you will likely take care of the problem, instead of running away from it and/or having to fight in tax court.\n\nGood luck!",
