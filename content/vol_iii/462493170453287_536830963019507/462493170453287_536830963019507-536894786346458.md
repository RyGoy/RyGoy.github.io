   "message": "If you mistakenly answer the phone to them or any other, never admit to being the name they are asking for. I always ask who they are and as soon as I find out I tell them they do not have my consent to use the minutes on my phone which I hold and pay for and they are not to call back under any circumstances. I never hear from any of them again. after that. all the while not acknowledging the name nor giving my name. possession is 9/10th of the law and if I am answering the phone I have the right to claim it as my property and determine who can benefit from its use. without having to identify myself.",
