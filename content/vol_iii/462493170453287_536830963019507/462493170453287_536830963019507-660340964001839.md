   "message": "Lee Carver Fairley, I would not recommend using the Notice of Mistake if you don't know why it even exists. I bet you haven't even looked at the legal definitions of all the words there. Have you?\n\nThere is no quick fix here, Lee, sorry. All we can do is point you to the material, and helping with the doubts.  We can't explain this stuff in a few post. For many it's taken months to get the notice. I am sure many others BELIEVE they know the notice, but I am sure they don't.\n\nSo, that being said, the notice works for things you did not contracted for. Like... government stuff. It does not work if you are trying to dishonour a contract you signed. Got that? \n\nYou deposit the surety bond on the record. You don't file anything else. Just that. THEN, you send via registered mail the notice of mistake to the judge, the prosecutor, the clerk, with a notarized copy of the surety bond attached. No signatures. Just NOTICE.\n\nIf that doesn't cut it, a SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR, as a friend of the court, in special appearance, has to do administration work and \"appear\", and stand on the notice. Do not let them proceed until ALL questions of the notice have been answered BEFORE proceeding. Stand your ground.\n\nIf you still don't know WHY you can do all this, then DON'T DO IT. Good luck!",
