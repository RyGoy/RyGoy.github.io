   "message": "I have read it, and I am getting two messages about surrendering the documents. It says in the notice that: \"As the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) has been deposited into the COURT\", which suggests (and I have seen it on video) that that particular document should be retained until a court hearing comes up. So I send in the others in advance then?",
