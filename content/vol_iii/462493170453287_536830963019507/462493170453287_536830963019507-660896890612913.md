   "message": "CRA called me for about 2 weeks and left messages for me to call them back. I finally answered one day and when they asked for the person I said I was the Sole Authorized Administrator for the person there was silence. They then asked my name and I just repeated what I had just told them and that any correspondence was to be done through letter. The agent asked again who I was to which I said 'the man not the person'. They then asked to speak to a human being and I then said ' human beings don't pay taxes'. Finally in frustration the agent told me to have a good day and hung up. That was over a month ago and still no letter...what gives...lol",
