   "message": "CRA calls me every second day since 3 weeks now, they keep leaving message in English in my voicemail, and they want me to call them back, they are in Toronto, I wonder why they call me from there, we have a place in in Shawinigan Quebec filled with CRA agent, why in the world they are calling me from Toronto ?\n\nThey are asking me to call them back and to state the corp. gst taxe number of the corp I happen to be the CEO of when they will answer the call\n\nThey are telling me that there open business hours are from 7:00am to 11:00pm\n\nThis is the first time in 9 years they are doing this\n\nAny thoughts ?\n\nThese people scares me and I don't want to be as STUPID as last time they've fucked me.\n\nWhy not just sending what they want by mail ?\n\nSorry, maybe off topic but I am wondering....\n\nThanks\nPierre",
