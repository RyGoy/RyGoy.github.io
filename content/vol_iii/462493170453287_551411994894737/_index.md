   "message": "Gail's inspired- Scott on how the WHITE-MAN fucked-over the NATIVE-ORIGINALS into getting them to think they are ABORIGINAL-INDIANS-thread.....\n\nGail Blackman: things are heating up related to the \"aboriginals\" and the govt....they are receiving their funding dollars and a note requiring them to sign in agreement with the all the legislation before they will get they're funding. I know it's a pretty deep issue, i.e. accepting the label \"aboriginal\" and the \"benefit\" etc. They are being legally blackmailed as I see it? Would a Notice of Mistake and a Petition similar to the one described in the CAS post, be a good starting point, for individuals or as a group or is it similar to what you described as being on social assistance and tricky? \n\nScott Duncan: It is EXACTLY that. It is legal exploitation. Giving up what is MOST precious, for a few \"benefits\". Anyone who says otherwise is serving another agenda.\n\nThere is no debate here. it's just fact. ABORIGINAL = SLAVE OF THE WHITE GUYS. Period.\n\nGail Blackman:the fact that they are requiring a signature of agreement for their dirty legislation, says to me that they don't have full power even though they like to make one think they do...if they didn't feel the need for agreement, then they would just carry on business as usual\n\nEamonn O Brien: Signature would seal the deal alright... Aboriginal = Resident (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nNorah Holloway:I only found out yesterday that my band (I'm First Nations) hasn't signed a treaty with the government. We own land an territories. The person I was talking to said they contract with companies for development of the resources.\n\nI was discussing this with someone and they said I should send a notice to the UN of Indigenous People.  Only figured this out yesterday.\n\nI have a status card with the govt. that's where my benefits come from.\n\nScott Duncan: Norah, as of 1933 there is NO SUCH THING as a NEW treaty. They will try to scam you into AGREEMENT. AGREEMENT is NOT a TREATY!. It's CONTRACT. Treaties and Contracts are NOT the same.\n\nKnownAs Colin: From an Aussie-centric perspective, only a Council of Elders can sign away land rights on behalf of their people; individuals can not.\nThere is a controversy about the true meaning of 'aboriginal'. In Latin it is written as 'ab original', which simply means 'from the original' and not inferior as most believe; same with the word 'abnormal'. 'Ab normal' means 'from the normal' and not necessarily meaning inferior.\n\nHere in Australia, the word(s) 'Aborigine/Aboriginal' is a created proper noun; however, aborigine is a co-joined from the Latin, 'ab origine', the Etymology of which is from Latin ab (�from�) + origine, ablative singular of origo (�earliest beginning, lineage, origin�).\nMost Australian Aborgines consider the word as offensive and, erroneously, associate it with abnormal.\n\nGail Blackman: When I look at the Indian Act it uses Indian and not Aboriginal..where did Aboriginal come from ?\n\nScott Duncan: ABORIGINAL = FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ALWAYS.\n\nScott Duncan: The ORIGINAL people cannot be touched under law, so they get you to declare that you have LEFT the original people, making you AWAY FROM the ORIGINALS. ABORIGINAL. If you are in Admiralty, you are DEMOTED. THAT is what makes them INFERIOR. Not the name.\n\nScott Duncan: If you are AWAY FROM the ORIGINALS, you are CRIMINALLY INSANE. That is what they are under the law.\n\n...but don't take MY word for it. See for yourself!\n\nhttps://ucadia.s3.amazonaws.com/acts_uk/1800_1899/uk_act_1867_criminal_lunatics.pdf\n\nGlad I could clear up the \"controversy\".",
