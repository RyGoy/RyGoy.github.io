   "message": "In accord with the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1901, s92, a licence to 'drive' on the public road network(s) only applies to those who do so, or intend to do so, for hire or reward by way of using a motor vehicle. However, those who do not use the road network(s) for hire or reward, use the roads for 'free travel' in an 'automobile' designed for 'free travel'. Consequently, the 'free traveller' and the 'automobile' do not require licensing or registering.\nTry explaining that to the Corporate Police ...they are just not interested, but only want a conviction for revenue.\nPersonally, we have only ever been issued with a 'license' to drive for hire or reward, never to 'travel freely'. This strongly suggests that the 'authorities' are fully aware they cannot license a 'free traveller' or 'automobile'.\nWhen in court, Prosecution must establish beyond benefit of doubt that the 'accused' was actually 'driving' a 'motor vehicle' and was receiving a reward of some form for doing so and violated a section(s) of an Act(s) in so doing.\nThe Corporate Police are most ignorant of these issues.",
