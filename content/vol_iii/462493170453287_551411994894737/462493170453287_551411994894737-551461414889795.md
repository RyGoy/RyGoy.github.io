   "message": "Her Majesty cannot enter into an new treaties, because Her Majesty has nothing to offer. Statute of Westminster. She is a trustee only and basically only has the right to engage in commerce on an equal playing field as everyone else. That means contract law, as in her being a Trustee. HER MAJESTY is the Crown corporation forcing everyone to abandon their rights for benefits, worthless ones, at the barrel of a gun. There is no treaty to be had with HER MAJESTY, as it is nothing more than a corporation licensed to trade securities, that is IT. They have NOTHING to offer and a treaty would be pointless. We don't need treaties, we need these assholes to start living up to their contracts and stop beating people into \"voluntarily\" surrendering their entitlements as the People.",
