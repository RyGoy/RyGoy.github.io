   "message": "I had Timmies for lunch and then I went down to provincal court to have my affidavit of Notice of Mistake notarized, again. (new and improved).  The clerk asked me what it is for?  I asked if it mattered?  Is it for court?  No, it's for the police and maybe trial in Oct, who cares? She signed her name.  Done.  But then I realized there was no stamp or seal, like the one previous.  So I asked her to do it..she seemed uncertain...but she did it after.  But....it if she didn't, would it have be a notarized document?  I requested a certified true copy of my probation order and bail recognizance.  Was told it takes 7-10 days.  Will mail to me.  Also requested the COMPLETE audio of a proceeding  in Jan where only partial was given prior, on a paid CD.  They forgot the part where I revoked all rights.  :(  Then, I went upstairs to Probation to retrieve a mailing address and neglected to report in.  Then I went to post office and registered mailed my NOM to the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary. I will report in via telephone  to probation until I send my NOM registered with cover letter.  Thanks for your input.",
