   "message": "Again, tangential.\n\nAnd worse yet, more ad hominems.\n\nFirst, you incorrectly identify me as religious.\nNow, you incorrectly identify me as law enforcement.\n\nAnd while you're wrong in both cases, even if you were right, that has nothing to do with this discussion.\n\nOne that is religious, or employed as law enforcement, or both, could still counter your claim in the same way that I have. And they would be right.\n\nYou might want to read up on logical fallacies, specifically ad hominems.\n\nAlso worth noting that you accuse me of being law enforcement, despite my attempts to stay on topic. My experience with such officers on the internet usually sees them trying to derail a conversation, and do anything but stay on topic. Behavior that you seem to be exhibiting.\n\nSo, again, I'm going to step back from this conversation. If you actually want to defend your claim, or prove my counterclaim false, I'll be happy to chime in. But I'll spend no more of my time rebutting ad hominems.",
