   "message": "Hey, no worries about misspelling and I caught your post before you edited so I understand.\nIf you take the word belief as it's definition, do you still consider all \"belief\" to be evil? Is it the word itself or the connotations and associations tied to that word by its use within Religion?\nIf belief equals an acceptance of facts or that something exists then it can be used within language in a way that makes the word itself acceptable. If the disagreement and the evil lies with the connotations, remove them and reclaim the word for its intended use.\nWords have the power we give them.",
