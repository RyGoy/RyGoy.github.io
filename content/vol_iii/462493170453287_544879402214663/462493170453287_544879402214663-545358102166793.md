It would have to be his opinion not one he had handed to him and the constant changing of subjects when questioned because he couldn't substantiate proves his lack of understanding of his original point so in my opinion any debate is a waste of time as it could only be one sided but each to his own but i personally value my time a bit more and for that reason am hitting unfollow post .
