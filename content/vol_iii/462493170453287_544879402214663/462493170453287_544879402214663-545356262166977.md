If you think you could have done or said something better or differently, then just try to do so in the future.\n\nAnd @Carl, we're all ignorant of something.

You're right that some people can't substantiate their positions very well, but that doesn't mean debating with them is without value.\n\nIt doesn't even mean that they are wrong. Plenty of people have been the better debaters in discussions, and managed to \"win\" debates that they were actually wrong about.\n\nI find the best thing to do, is to assume that everyone is genuinely trying to learn and understand, despite it not always being the case.\n\nIt is assumed that when someone is asking questions, it is because they want to understand.",
