   "message": "@Leigh I already challenged the claim that \"the majority is always wrong\", and provided a clear example where the majority is 'right'. The only objection one could make would be to claim that no one can ever be 'right' about anything, and thus, nor can the majority.\n\nIf that is your claim, then we are not using the same definition of the word 'right'.\n\nMy claim stands: The majority is NOT always wrong.\n\n@Frisbey Though tangential to the discussion at hand, I will point out that your logic is flawed. You said: \n\n\"That you have chosen twice to avoid answering that question it is inferred that you do believe in God.\"\n\nYour inference, and thus logic, is incorrect. I do not believe in \"God\".\n\nEven if your logic wasn't flawed, that would not help your case in regards to the majority.\n\n((And though this should probably be another thread entirely, I also challenge your claim that all belief is evil. Though this obviously depends upon your definition of 'belief', as well as the definition of 'evil'.))",
