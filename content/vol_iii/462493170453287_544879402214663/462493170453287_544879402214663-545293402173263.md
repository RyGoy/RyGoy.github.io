   "message": "In NO way is that proof that \"the majority is ALWAYS wrong\".\n\nSomeone could be wrong about every single thing they've ever thought, and that would provide zero evidence of your claim.\n\nYou clearly do not understand how a logical discussion works, or what a proof is.\n\nhttp://unrforliberty.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Our-Discussion.jpg\n\nRebutting your false presumptions, ad hominems, flawed logic, and irrelevant tangents is getting quite tedious.\n\nMy counterclaim and proofs stand:\n\nThe majority of people are NOT wrong about walking.\nThe majority of people are NOT wrong about breathing.\n\nThus, the majority are NOT always wrong.\n\nSo, once again, please post proof of claim, or any evidence that my counterclaim and proofs are flawed.\n\nUntil you do, your claim stands disproven, and I will refrain from engaging in off-topic, tangential, irrelevant discussion.",
