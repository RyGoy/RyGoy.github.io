   "message": "I really don't think that belief in God is the question here and I believe (atheistically) that a discussion about the majority always/not always being wrong can be had without bringing Religion or the concept of \"God\" into things.\n\nMr Frisbey - If you wish to assume things about others then you damage your own argument if those assumptions are proved wrong. Deal with facts and don't make presumptions.\nI would also recommend that you focus less on something that seems a personal quest - calling out those who believe in God or those who are religious and perhaps focus more on the actual answers someone is providing to the statement you originally posed.\n\nIf you disagree, that's fine but offer some explanation as to why someone's answer makes a difference or disproves the logical and rational rebuttal to your original statement.",
