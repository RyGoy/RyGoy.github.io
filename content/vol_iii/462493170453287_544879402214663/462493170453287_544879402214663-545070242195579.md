   "message": "Actually, we don't need to. You made the claim that:\n\n\"The majority is always wrong\"\n\nThus it is you who must provide proof of claim.\n\nFurthermore, I have provided two, thus far undisputed, examples that contradict your claim.\n\nThe only argument left to you, is that no one can ever be 100% right about anything, and thus, nor can the majority.\n\nAnd while that argument is a dodge, its irrelevant, because it equally invalidates your position; we can never be 100% wrong about anything.\n\nAlso, its irrelevant which 'majority' you choose. Even if we restrict the conversation to the majority of all human beings on the planet, it doesn't change my position.",
