   "message": "Well, I see that the examples I gave contradicting your initial claim have still not been challenged.\n\nWhether we're talking common understanding, or Law, does not change your initial claim:\n\nThe majority is always wrong.\n\nNor does it effect my counterclaim proving yours to be incorrect:\n\nThe majority of people are NOT wrong about walking.\nThe majority of people are NOT wrong about breathing.\n\nThus, the majority are NOT always wrong.\n\nNow, you seem to be more interested in tangential discussions than trying to defend your initial, thus far disproven, claim; So I will leave you to it.",
