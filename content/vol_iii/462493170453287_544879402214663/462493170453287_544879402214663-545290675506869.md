   "message": "Which knee jerk response? Your claim that I am a cop was irrelevant to this discussion, and not really worth answering. I did answer, in hopes of showing you how wrong you are, and that you ought not jump to such conclusions.\n\nBut as far as this topic is concerned, me being a cop, or me not being a cop, is irrelevant.\n\nI also admit that in many cases, I do think like the majority, and likely value some things that the majority values. This is not wrong. This is not incorrect. \n\nMore importantly, it it IRRELEVANT to this discussion.\n\nPlease post proof of claim, or any evidence that my counterclaim and proofs are flawed.",
