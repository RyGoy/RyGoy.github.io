   "message": "Saying \"this is a fact\" implies that it is right. You are claiming that it is impossible for the majority of people on this planet to know any one fact. That is patently, and obviously false.\n\nYour comment about walking on water has nothing to do with this discussion.\n\nI'm off to bed for the night, but my examples stand, unchallenged. Thus, my claim as well:\n\nThe majority is NOT always wrong.\n\nAs for assumptions, like presumptions, they are a part of the way conscious living creatures interpret and experience the world. Simple as that.\n\nAlso, Katt never used the word \"well\".\n\nGoodnight, and good debating!",
