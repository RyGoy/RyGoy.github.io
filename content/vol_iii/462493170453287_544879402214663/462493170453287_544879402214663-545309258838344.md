   "message": "Not me that deserves that apology and I'm not too sure that Dragon can entirely and inaccurately come up with some of the responses that were deleted.\n However, now that''s been pointed out, let's get back to the original statement.\n\n\"The majority is always wrong and one should desire to do completely opposite anything on what the majority wishes.\" \n\nIs a pithy quote that serves to promote the minority as correct and right. So let's look at that a little bit more.\n\nIf the majority of this group agreed with your statement, they would instantly make it wrong and the onus would be on people to change stance and go back to disputing the claim and vice versa until there's a catch 22 of silliness.\n\nSo let's expand to other consider different contexts and other situations.\n\nI think it would be fair and I would be right in saying that the \"majority\" of people think that murder is wrong and similarly, a majority would agree that it is right to protect children from physical abuse.\n\nIf the statement \"The majority is always wrong\" is true then any time, ever, there is a majority consensus - it is wrong by default no matter what the context of the majority is which makes it a very flawed argument.\n\nWith the examples that both Steven Sharp and I have given, it is impossible for the majority to be wrong - breathing, walking, disbelief in God, tacit acceptance of murder and physical abuse.\n\nIf a certain factor within a statement, in this case the use of the word majority, can be shown to be fallacious then that is what should be considered and discussed.\n\nA majority can be wrong - Fact. But that fact does not preclude the fact that a majority can also be right.\n\nThe second part of the statement - \"one should desire to do completely opposite anything on what the majority wishes\" is entirely argumentative and deliberately contrary.\n\nWhat if the majority of your friends agree that you should have a really nice birthday? If your statement is true, that means the minority of your friends are obliged to make your birthday terrible.\nNot because they don't like you or because they think they are correct in making your birthday terrible but simply because they are a minority.\n\nThe statement \"\"The majority is always wrong and one should desire to do completely opposite anything on what the majority wishes.\"  can never be true because it uses the word \"always\" and it has been shown in this thread that the majority is not \"always\" wrong.\n\nA revision of the statement could be \"\"The majority can be wrong and one should desire to do completely the opposite of what the majority wishes when they are proven to be wrong\".\n\nIt's not as snappy as a quote but it's far more accurate and easy to adhere to.",
