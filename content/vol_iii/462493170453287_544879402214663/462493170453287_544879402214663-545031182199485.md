   "message": "Though not for lack of trying, I really don't think I understand your position.\n\nWhat do \"God\", \"Jesus Christ\", or \"Scott Duncan\" have to do with this discussion? How would my belief or disbelief in any of those things be relevant?\n\nIs your claim that the majority believes in God, and they are wrong, thus the majority is wrong?\n\nSo what? Again, I've admitted twice already that the majority is often wrong.\n\nBut just because the majority is OFTEN wrong, does not make them ALWAYS wrong. And that was your claim; that the majority is ALWAYS wrong.\n\nThat is a patently false statement. The majority is NOT always wrong.",
