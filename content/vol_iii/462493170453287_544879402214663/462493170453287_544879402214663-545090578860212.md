   "message": "Logical fallacy: False Dilemma.\n\"I believed what I was told, I believe what I was told was wrong. All belief is evil\".\nI'm going to be a bit harsh and point out that you deleted a post earlier in this thread wherein you apologised for misspelling my name because you were dyslexic.\n\nThat's nothing to be ashamed of and it's also something you can still have after teaching yourself to read and write. That's an amazing accomplishment but it doesn't serve to prove that \"all\" belief is evil.\n\nThe trouble with belief and what people tell you is that people are flawed, people can and will be wrong.\nI was told by Doctors that I'd probably be crippled and in a wheelchair, my belief that they could possible be right served as a whopping big motivation to prove them wrong. And I did, all thanks to the internet and Bromelain.\nI was told by Doctors that my Mother would die, they were right and I believed them because what they told me was based on overwhelming scientific evidence.\nAcceptance of that belief, however terrifying and however fucking sad that was allowed both my Mother and myself to find the best way possible to deal with a situation we could not change.\n\nBelief has been both good and bad for me, I think that is the same for many people. Neither the worst nor the best examples I can give serve to prove that belief is one or the other because it is not. Belief can be many things but the concept and the word itself are not evil.",
