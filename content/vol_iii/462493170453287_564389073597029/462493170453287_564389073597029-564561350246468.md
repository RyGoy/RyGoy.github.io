   "message": "Sounds like the Chief, except that the Chief whispers about the fluidity of law and being able to uphold your law through your word, conduct and demeanor. There is truth (in my view), despite your YELLING, that many have been tricked to move from a superior position through great paperwork, only to create joinder, and enter into a jurisdiction they may not want to be in via their lack of knowledge concerning the importance of the law's fluidity. I always try to keep in mind the hot potato being passed around. :)",
