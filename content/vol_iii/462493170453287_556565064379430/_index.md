   "message": "I bought a book the other day from a second hand store called Law in Action, Understanding Canadian Law. It turns out it was a high school law class text (I think). I opened it up and looked at the index, I was, in particular, looking to see if they had anything on trust law. Nothing. So then I go to the definitions page to see if they have PERSON defined. Nothing. Then I started to read various parts of it to see if PERSON is used anywhere in it, and I didn't see that word anywhere, however I did see the word \"people\" used fairly often. \n\nIt was interesting going through it because now realizing/recognizing the real meaning of 'understanding' the information in the book is feeding readers i nsuch a way that they do/will stand under their fraud.",
