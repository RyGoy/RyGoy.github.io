   "message": "I think it's just the pressure that is being put on the Courts here by people who are standing as a MAN to them. I've never heard of these names that this guy uses, (but then again, who am I?)but I have a good memory to faces, and this woman who claims victim, looks familiar. (And is batshit crazy, which is why I'm leaning to a psychopath I interacted with at the Crown prosecutors office, or the psychopath who claimed to be a justice of the peace at the Court house.) There have been 2 or 3 phony bomb scares here in the last year. What ever happened to the truck that was to have been driven into the Court house? I now wish that I would have gone down there to see if it did happen. Jason claimed it didn't happen and I had no reason to dispute his claim. I'll use this as a gauge to see how many fools are taking the bait and talking shit now. Time to speak loud and firm to those fish.",
