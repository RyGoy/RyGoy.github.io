O.o \n\nI am not the smartest guy around, but I KNOW how to count, well, my calculator knows :D\n\nAnd the irony, MONEY is the fucking issue....it is the MONEY...!!! :D\n\nBut the FIRST time I felt that FEAR going away from me, it was Dean Clifford on my screen, I will NEVER forget that :D , because I was big time scared of these fuckers.....\n\nMy two cents :D\nPierre",
