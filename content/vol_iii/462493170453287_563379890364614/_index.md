   "message": "Forgive me, as I STEP ONTO MY SOAP BOX, I�ve had several (strong) drinks�\n\nA friend of mine forwarded this link to me. It APPEARS to me that Mario Antonacci, AKA, Andreas Pirelli, of the Calgary Embassy is a complete PIECE of SHIT.\n\nYou would think that a greater understanding of public & private jurisdictions, contracts and trusts would instil compassion & responsibility in so called \"FREEMEN\" but obviously, SOME just don't get it.\n\nBehavior like this only HURTS our quest to be intelligently heard. I am NOT a fucking �FREEMAN ON THE LAND� and I certainly am NOT a fucking �SOVEREIGN�. I am nothing but a BENEFICIARY. My inability to �PAY� debt PRECLUDES me from being a responsible trustee so what else can I be, but a beneficiary? That fucking justice on the bench can be trustee; who gives a fuck about the decedent�s public account anyway? Certainly not I.\n\nProblem is, idiots like Andreas Pirelli fuck shit up for the rest of us. Those kinds of fucking RETARDS have made it very difficult to interact with the public in a nice and calm manner. Almost every time we step into a face to face with public officials, whether on the street or in court � we are considered FREEMEN/Terrorists. That makes it VERY tough to have an intelligent conversation and/or be taken seriously.\n\nIf you�re still chasing DOLLAR BILLS and/or recklessly using liens for billion of dollars against your fellow men/women, you just don�t GET it; you�re a fucking TOOL and have a lot left to learn.\n\nIf you�re still making statements like � I�m a FREEMAN on the LAND! You just don�t get it and have a lot left to learn. STOP making statements/arguing and start ASKING questions.\n\nYes, there is a time and place for liens - once agreement of the parties has been established. If you file and can�t hold your shit, sucks to be you. You deserve what you get.\n\nWith knowledge comes responsibility. If you use your knowledge to harm, you are no better than those you hurt. As far as I�m concerned, sorry, I just don�t have time for you. \n\nAs I STEP OFF MY SOAP BOX, I say, learn your trust structures people. This whole pursuit for freedom thing is not going to get any easier any time soon. Public perception is that we�re all cut from the same FREEMAN cloth�\n\nIf you give a shit and/or have a few minutes to burn,  you can read all about that fucking Andreas monkey here.... Peace�",
