   "message": "As I said, he's a complete piece of shit. His background has been revealed to me by several people I trust. There's no honor there whatsoever. Anyways, he better watch his back, there are angry people out there who want their cash returned.\n\nFar as gurus go, we get fucked up the ass enough in the \"public\", no need to start fucking each other up the ass in the private, especially for information. For a \"guru\" to charge 400 legal tenders a head to teach whatever is a fucking money/LABOR grab, nothing more.\n\nFrom what I hear, Dean's seminars charge just enough to cover expenses, which is reasonable. I was actually bugging Beverly to check out the next one with me. I do not understand why someone would bash Dean and would ask - Well, what the FUCK are YOU doing to help out people??? No comment? Then shut your fucking mouth. Running your mouth on facebook ain't helping anyone.",
