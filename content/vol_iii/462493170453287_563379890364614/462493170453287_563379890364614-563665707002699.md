I can draw up all the documents you need and teach you were to obtain your registration of a live birth.\n\nTo make a claim of rights for you will take me two days of my time\nTo correctly make a notice and demand will take me a day.\nYou would have to send for your registration of live birth it takes 14 days and is Free of charge.\n\nI can do this for you and meet you later this week if you are interested.\n\nI would ask 1800$ donation for my time and energy to do all this, much cheaper then a lawyer..LOL..\n\nLet me know if you are interested \n \n:D",
