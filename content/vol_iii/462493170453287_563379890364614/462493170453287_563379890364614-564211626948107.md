   "message": "i emailed them a brief story on the 2 years of harassment and downright stocking we suffered in trying to be free from the food industry. I am certainly not a free man I have not yet found a way to escape my debt slavery but I am working very hard to do so. \n\nIts sad that people think Canadians are free and who the fuck owns a home if they don't pay tax then what they take your home so does that not mean you are a renter?\n\nI have 2 years of video documenting harassment and the struggle to just grow and raise our own food. I will wait and see if they get back to me I doubt they will but should they be interested we will give them some footage that will make most Canadians head spin and there is nothing like a 7 year old girl crying to some big dumb ass RCMP why are you taking my rabbits and chickens!",
