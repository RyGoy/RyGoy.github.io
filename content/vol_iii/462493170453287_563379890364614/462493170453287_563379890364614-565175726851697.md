Dean Clifford I ask that you forgive me for the harsh words I expressed in this forum and TTFL forum. There are those who claim to be freemen that are in fact destroying the good work you do on our behalf. When I see these shit stains going against everything you and the others in the freeman movement have created it fills me with anger. That anger was directed at the wrong individuals and for that I am truly sorry. I humble myself before you and the other individuals whom I offended. I ask that you forgive my ignorant and outright asshat behaviour.\n\nDavid Smile....",
