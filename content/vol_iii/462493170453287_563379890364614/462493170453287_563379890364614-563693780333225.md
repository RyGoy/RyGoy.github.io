   "message": "the TFL is a unique experience, Scott gives his time & knowledge freely. The fact is nobody owes us anything, unfortunately many have a huge sense of entitlement. This is scotts page on scotts terms until you can row for yourself. Nobody is forcing anybody to attend any seminar or part with any money they dont want to, its free choice. Having spent time here & scott making himself available to our every question has some of us SPOILED :D cheers dude!!!",
