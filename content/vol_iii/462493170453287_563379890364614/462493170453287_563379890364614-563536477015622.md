   "message": "This is also bullshit. This story should be renamed \"Landlord has trouble evicting bad tenant.\", but of course that does not have the right spin on it. As a former landlord of several properties, I can tell you RIGHT now that tenants are fucking impossible to get out. They go crying to residential tenancies, and next thing the same fucking assholes trying to steal our lives, Her Majesty acting through agents and offices, shows up telling you that you cannot evict people just because they refuse to pay you rent for 6 FUCKING MONTHS, and they are protected and you have to go to court and get a FUCKING COURT ORDER to have them removed....and if they are on welfare, they will not grant you a court order. \n\nFuck these lying pricks. If this was a welfare shit heel who refused to work, the story would be \"EVIL LANDLADY tries to evict POOR, IMPOVERISHED man who is down on his luck.\"\n\nTHIS is why I want to smash this system.",
