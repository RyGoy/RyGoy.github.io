   "message": "Ha! CBC is looking for a freeman to interview. I sent them a quick response.      I was wondering if Anna-Maria Tremonti would like to take up my challenge. I will pay her, or anyone else, one thousand Canada dollars if they can get a certified true copy of the income tax act from the Queens printer. Maybe that should be the first thing that you try before you attempt to interview anyone who stands up for their RIGHTS! Or, better yet, contact Dean Clifford either on his facebook page, or at Dean Clifford.info. Also, I have one question for you or Anna-Maria. CBC showed a truck that had driven into the Calgary Court house about 2 months ago, yet, I can not find any evidence of this ever happening. Did this really happen, or is CBC promoting hatred towards anyone who stands for the truth?\nThankyou for your time:",
