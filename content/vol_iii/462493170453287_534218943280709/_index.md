   "message": "I have to say, first of all... I�m so glad we�re not on FB feed anymore! Glad to be done with that. What I am learning and/or doing is none of anyone�s business, especially when they have absolutely no grasp and/or care of what this group is about. \n\nI feel like I am in an ELITE group here now... with  actual TRUTH of what really affects our lives as a whole. I didn�t �believe� anything Scott had to say 7 months ago, but based on results, and everything I could look up and devour on the interweb... he has shown me exactly what makes the most sense... that all of this crap is all and only about money. This part I have seen played out (now even more) in so many different ways. \n\nThis is why The Tender For Law has made the most sense to me.\n\nWhen you said, �I will train my slaves for occupations that don't even exist yet, and deploy them to serve US. They will have to suffer getting wealthy in the process, or having a larger purpose. Above all, my slaves won't think wrong. They will NOT value the wrong things.�\n\n�I don�t want to be �wealthy� in any� liability� sense, I have been surrounded with those people all of my life. I have only witnessed this �go to their heads.� Wealth to me is KNOWLEDGE. That is where I see wealth. The LARGER PURPOSE.\n\nThis is WEALTH to me:\n\n�Imagine a navy FILLED with \"Judges\" We will build SAFE HARBOUR for those seeking sanctuary. We will train up EVERYONE so they are at my diversity of skills, because I will KNOW what to do with yours. When you learn HOW I do it, you will be free. You will round up your OWN slaves. I will turn all of you loose on a population who does not grasp the exponential function.�\n\nIn end, I do not see anything the same anymore. I drive to work and look at everyone, busy trotting along, following every belief they have been presented, wondering if any one of them has any clue what they are doing. \n\nBut what I do know is they will all get sick of this eventually.  And they will all start looking for answers. \n\nScott, your time has not been ill-spent.",
