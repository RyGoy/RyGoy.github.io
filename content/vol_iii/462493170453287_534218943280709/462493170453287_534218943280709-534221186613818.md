   "message": "This group has changed my life. I know that may sound \"cliche\", but it all boils down to that.  \n\nWhen I realized, and then CONFIRMED I was thinking incorrectly, I felt a LOT of rage, and anger. I was miserable (thank you, Scott!).\n\n Then I bitch-slapped myself to reality, and now I am enjoying the ride more than ever. :)\n\nThis IS the MOST useful and VALUABLE Internet page, for the living. Thank you for closing it to the dead ones. It's hard to learn, while trying to ignore the shit-stains all over.",
