   "message": "\"Acts\" are extrictly for the members of THEIR COMMUNITIES. We are NOT in the Club. Unless we want to \"act\" as surety for the legal name, and/or unless you sign an Oath, and/or a contract. I also wonder what they mean with \"police services.\" \"Peace officer,\" \"Police\" and \"law enforcement officer\" are NOT the same. At least in the US, law enforcement officers are there not to protect, and serve, but to ENFORCE THE LAW to the code breakers. By USING FORCE if necessary. That's it. I'm not clear in Canada, but it has got to be the same. So, I \"believe\" there is a play of words here that one has to be attentive.",
