   "message": "Hi guys! thank-you for accepting me into your group I look forward to learning alot from all of you! With that being said I am hoping to be able to discuss a lil run in I had with the law with you cats. Last year I was arrested, and shortly released with a promise to appear. So on the date I was scheduled to appear, I show up at the courthouse. Lo and behold there is no sign of me begin scheduled for court that day. Confused I asked to get in contact with someone and was given the number of the crown prosecution. When I called I could only speak to his secretary and all she told me was \"wait for a letter in the mail\". So 8 months later I get a call from an RCMP officer telling me I have had a Public Interest Warrant issued 7 months ago, and that I have to go to the province it was issued from (I live in canada eh) to clear it up. Because of their severe lack of communication ive been hanging on a thread for almost a year now about this case, does this situation give me any leverage?",
