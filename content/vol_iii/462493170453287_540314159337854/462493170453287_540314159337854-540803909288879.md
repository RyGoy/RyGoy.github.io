   "message": "cheers Dino, its not really a \"sharing is caring\" forum. Scott is well aware of the profiles attending TFL no doubt, i think the truth is we all have something in our backgrounds that we'll attribute to bringing us here,I find reflections of my own experiences in almost everyone here. it has slipped out on more than one occasion that posters had lost everything/ had horrific encounters with the system/psychopaths which made them realise the previous delusion. I think the harder you are hit the greater the realisation probably. This forum offers the ability for some to come to a full realisation of what happened to us, why it happened, what we can do about it & the wider ramifications of our actions going forward. imho, Its sort of a psychology therapy so we can drop our \"feelings/beliefs\" about what happened & discipline ourselves to the facts . If its any consolation i haven't had an accident & suffer mental block, chewing gum mind, i find myself reading things over & over without it clicking, its usually a sign i'm holding a belief contrary to the fact. welcome aboard the good ship TFL... standby for upgrades",
