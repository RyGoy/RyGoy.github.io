   "message": "Tell them you've decided to deal with your \"issues\" on your own. Once they tried to get me to sign a \"participation agreement\" or something similar. I told them that i would consider it and asked them to leave me a copy and I would review it with my lawyer. They said that I must have something to hide which makes them more interested in my case. I responded that I wasn't a lawyer, and that I needed time to review the agreement and to understand the legal implications of it. They hounded me for days. In the end I told them I wasn't interested but thanks for offering their help. They went away. :)",
