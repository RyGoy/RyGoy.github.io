   "message": "Again, on the Territory and many of the people are standing around watching this officer beat this man on the ground. If i saw an officer beating a man, i would step in and stop him, its our duty to up hold peace, the man is catching a beat down and officer swings overs and boots the woman who is also on the ground. Wow Military type policing is here, it can only get worse.  Thoughts?\n",
