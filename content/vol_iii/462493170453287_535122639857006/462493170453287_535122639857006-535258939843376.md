   "message": "THE 10 BIGGEST ERRORS MOST PEOPLE MAKE WHEN FACING THE PIRATES AND PRIVATEERS OF THE PRIVATE BAR GUILDS \n\nUcadia Blog - Wednesday, November 14, 2012\n\nTo be blunt � many people continue to make fundamental and silly errors when facing the pirates and privateers of the Private Bar Guilds � often with dire consequences.  Some of these errors continue to be of such a basic level of competence, that it is surprising so many fail to consider common sense and avoid sabotaging the slimmest of margins in resolving matters with a kleptocratic guild that demands absolute loyalty by forcing its members to perpetually demonstrate perfidy, treachery and malfeasance.\n\nERROR #6 � Fighting (creating conflict with) Pirates\n\n[42] The sixth, most frequent error committed by those facing the Private Bar Guilds and their private commercial courts is when litigants confident in their own skills at oratory or documentation choose to fight and create conflict with the Pirates and Privateers; and\n\n[43] This is a tragic cost- as many a brave soul have risen through experience to believe they can match in assertiveness and skill those registered members of the secret societies that practice pseudo-law, only to find the sharp fangs of procedural injustice at its worst; and\n\n[44] The truth is that the system needs conflict, it demands controversy- it relishes and celebrates the belligerent litigant � as the poster character for supporting propaganda aligned at warning others, that such �anti-law�, �anti-establishment� and �anti-government� behavior will not be tolerated. Those that actively pursue the courts, sometimes with personal vendettas unfortunately created terrible injury against the law and the rest of society by enabling the system to re-set itself and parody genuine concerns as �extremists� and more recently as �paper terrorists�.",
