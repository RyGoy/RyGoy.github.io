   "message": "In this country known as Canada we gradually came to accept being referred to as a person, especially after the famous Emily Murphy case. Whereas she concluded that women should have the status of a person and therefore be equal with men. The truth is that women always were equal and in the end as they have found out, have given up their god given inalienable rights for the rights of a dead corporation. \nThe key word here is dead, all formed in legal fiction PERSONS have attained the status of a dead in law corporation. All corporations are dead; they exist only on paper and in your mind. Now, under Roman civil law as we have in Canada, a dead corporation such as a government cannot deal with the living and as such can only deal with the dead. Hence the dead formed in legal fiction government can only deal/contract with another dead formed in legal fiction entity such as a �person�. \nYou, are aware aren�t you, that the living cannot communicate or contract with the dead? The proof is everywhere if you only look for it. Our forefathers knew this and that is why our so called constitution begins with �Canada is founded upon the principles that recognize the Supremacy of God and the rule of law�. According to our de jure head of state the living private woman Elizabeth Mary Alexandra: Windsor acting as the corporate Queen holds the King James Bible as the rule of law as stated in her coronation in 1953",
