We use JAG accounting, etc.\n\nThe shit on LAND is BROKEN. Thousands of subdivided clubhouses with interconnected rules that NOBODY listens to.\n\nKate studies the rules so she can act powerfully among the savages when she is on land.\n\nNX-25 (Tycho Brahe) is the last vessel that has crew on land. We make sure we know the laws we touch, so we can extricate ourselves from it without anybody noticing.\n\n..which is hard to do, what with me stirring up shit by teaching you chowder-heads. :P",
