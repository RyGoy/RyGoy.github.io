   "message": "So to be a part of your club, I have to know the rules.?   I don't remember trying to sell you anything,  I am a born again christian and I am sorry you don't approve and If that offends you I won't mention it again.  But being a very hateful bully does not prove that I am delusional.  And let's not forget what my comment was about.  Knowing the rules is not useless,  I can show you real court papers terminating a permanent care and custody order from a real place in NS and I am pretty sure that my real son is sleeping in his room... I just wonder why you are so angry,  I don't even go to church, I do not believe in religion.  So please don't penalize me sir,  if you stop posting hateful comments about christians then I won't post replies, or you can kick me off,  your club, your rules.",
