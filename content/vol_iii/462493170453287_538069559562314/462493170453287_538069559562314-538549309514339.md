   "message": "What a great group!.  Scott Duncan, what an angry little man,  called a woman a Stupid bitch because she didn't agree with you about knowing laws, so to teach her not to disagree you changed your tirade to the subject to religion, an obvious sore spot,  and told yourself that gives you the right to treat people however you see fit.  As long as you got a good reason, go for it...  Not one bit different than government.    Don't worry, people in government can't admit they are abusers either.  they just keep making up rules to justify their behaviour.   Talk about people not thinking for themselves...  God is not telling Israel to smash the heads of their infants against rocks. Read the Scripture in context and then go to other Scriptures and history and find its true meaning.\nBillions of people in this world and poor you, have to carry the burden of knowing the truth about everything Thank..nobody...you just happened to be that one in a billion...",
