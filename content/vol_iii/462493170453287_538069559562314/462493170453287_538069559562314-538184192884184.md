   "message": "Dallas Hills, I honestly don't know why Dean Clifford has ANYTHING to do with the OPPT Frauds. \n\nThey DO NOT have the right to do ANY \"legal\" act on my behalf, an the fact that they think they do, should raise some alarm bells.\n\nI have a feeling that's why Dean is talking to them. He's handing them rope to hang themselves.\n\nAnyway the OPPT is banned here, and no endorsement of that Sack-of-shit lawyer and her fraud will be tolerated here.\n\nThat would be your first and last warning.",
