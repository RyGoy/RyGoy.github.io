   "message": "I was given a recognisance to sign once before. I had only started learning about commerce and law etc... I was clueless to be honest. \n\nI wouldn't think signing a docket as a promise to appear would implicate you. If you refuse to sign it you may appear guilty. Once you're not signing as surety and solely as an honorable promise to appear to resolve the issue I'd imagine it should be alright...\n\nAs always though, I could be wrong... :p",
