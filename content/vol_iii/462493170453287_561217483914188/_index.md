   "message": "Hey Scott, who is this Lege Unum retard? He tried getting into things with me today. He never says anything relevant, talks in endless circles, and then accuses you of doing that very thing. Anyways, made him look like a punk, almost worth reading, but not really. Got him to confess that even he does not like his own posts.   :D  \n\nHahahahahaha! \n\nLege Unum: \"I never like my own posts ... you seem to be confused littlun\"\n\nPost that, that is a keeper. It admits that it does not even like its own posts. It probably also does not like its own life, looks, hair, clothing, make-up and living accommodations in its parents basement.\n\nWin.",
