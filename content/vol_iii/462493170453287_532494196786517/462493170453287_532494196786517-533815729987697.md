   "message": "It becomes a major headfuck to begin to comprehend that the people who brought us into the world, cared for us, loved & nurtured us, fed us the bullshit of the tooth fairy, santa claus etc etc to manipulate us into being good...they readily justify that (especially growing up in a parenting model where you can't/don't want to hit children, so they use other forms of behaviour modification) & we accept it...they know it's fake and acknowledge it.\n\nBut to question the grand daddy of all concepts, the magical skydaddy that enslaves & manipulates but loves us (if we are good little slaves), only deconstructs the entire foundation of any and all heirarchical structures and the basis for any form of authority...and often the behaviour is decidedly ungodlike.\n\nThe only reason I continue to tolerate the 'theists' is because of this question:  What do you propose as a better solution?\n\nI don't yet have a good enough response to that question.",
