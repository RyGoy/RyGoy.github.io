   "message": "It's like the belief programming is layered in with the emotions and held in place by the emotions...once they can free themselves of the emotions, then there is nothing for that seed of belief to stick to. You can even see in here when the emotions get in the way, then there is bickering and arguing....not all have recognized the true  benefit of the group and allow their emotions to control them and either remove themselves in a huff from the group or feel a tingling sensation beyond their control.",
