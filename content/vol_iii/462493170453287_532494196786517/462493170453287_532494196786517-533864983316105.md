Because you are so fucking \"considerate\" there are now A BILLION PEOPLE who think I should be killed for saying \"faeces be upon him\", when referring to the Prophet Mohammed (Who DID exist, BTW).\n\nYou think POLICE are willing to harm you? Wait until a \"loving christian\" gets ahold of you!\n\nRidicule and contempt. Start with ADULT WITH AN IMAGINARY FRIEND. That one always fucks them up. :D\n\nThink about that. It's not untrue!\n\nAN ADULT.\n\nWITH AN IMAGINARY FRIEND!\n\nWHY IS THIS NOT ALARMING TO YOU!",
