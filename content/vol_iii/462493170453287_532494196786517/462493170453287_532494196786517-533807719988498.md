   "message": "Ok, slightly different question based on Pierre's thread/question re the B of E Act, if we are sent a bill and not provided with the instructions on how to discharge it, how do we remedy the situation and/or where do we instruct the bill be sent for discharge & setoff, the central bank & not the treasury?\n\nThis is the part I'm getting hung up on.  \n\nI appreciate & now understand your ethical issue with the process if it is harming others Scott, but is there another way, or by using commerce are we ultimately harming 'someone' or several someones?\n\nie: Is the end result ultimately to cause loss or harm if we use this system?...and is that the way the system has been designed in the first place?",
