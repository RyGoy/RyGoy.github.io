   "message": "So your saying an affidavit of life in a court of record won't reestablish the position of settler of the trust...? Oh by the way genius \" One original thought is worth a million mindless quoatings\" Do you have any of those ? There is nothing here that can't be read or heard elsewhere and repeating to the uninformed might make you feel superior but it doesn't establish that position for you in my perspective. Further the rudeness diminishes your capacity in my eyes. I can appreciate your fear of the unknown however simply screaming a thing at others in a foul and illiterate manner doesn't make it true...as for your sky daddy disdain sounds like a personal problem. I came (politely I might add) seeking info I haven't yet felt like cowling to feet of the great Scott Duncan as so many of the obvious sycophants atheists here  do and while I appreciate your disdain for religion and such I personally do not find pleasure in the self promotional attitude that permeates this group. If however you developed some manners along the way I might be enticed to further interaction otherwise from here I will remain silent.",
