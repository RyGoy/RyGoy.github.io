   "message": "ANY Christian who wants to be an atheist, needs to sit down and read the bible COVER TO COVER. Read it like a novel. Start at Genesis, and read all the way to Revelation. TRY it.\n\nEvery one of you. Read the bible. ACTUALLY read it. If you aren't an atheist after you do, then kill yourself. You will be helping your fellow man. If you can read that pile of plagiarized shit and STILL think it's true, then you are simply too stupid, and evil to live.",
