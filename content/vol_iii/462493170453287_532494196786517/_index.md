   "message": "I can't find the thread where Scott mentioned that the banks exchange currency, so will start a new one to ask this. I want to be sure I comprehend this correctly. \n\n For example, a loan, our signature creates the credit, the bank exchanges the credit for legal tender....how would you describe what is backing our signature to give us the power to create the credit? I know the banks suggestion we are in the debtor category and that our labour is what pays off the loan, which isn't accurate,  is it the security of the person/birth certificate that is the backing of our signature?",
