   "message": "\"I don't believe in a god, and I hope there isn't one. But if it turns out there is a God who \"takes\" people in plane crashes, cares about your sex life, justifies slavery, and quietly watches children die in earthquakes, and inflicts babies with defects to \"test the parents' faith\", and ordered \"His people\" to slaughter neighbouring peoples... \n\nI could go on all night\n\nBut If that Being exists, my only question is: How do we find It and kill It?\" - I paraphrase. I heard a brave man say it to a preacher.",
