   "message": "That's why I have trialled it using a credit card because I figure that the finance/accounting department of a bank should understand what's happening & just process & forward it as instructed.\n\nOnce the process is perfected, I will do one of two things:\n1.  Try it with water rates, electricity bills etc to see if their accountants know how to deal with it.\n2.  Charge everything to the credit card & then discharge it using the process each month.\n\nThat way, private businesses providing a valuable service aren't having to deal with something they may not understand & it saves the hassle of doing it numerous times a month on every bill.\n\nAnd if it's discharged properly, then debt is being removed from the system which can't be a bad thing ;-)",
