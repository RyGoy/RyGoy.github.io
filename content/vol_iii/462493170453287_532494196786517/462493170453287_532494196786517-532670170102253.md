   "message": "My dental appointment left me in a bit of a predicament, beyond a frozen mouth lol...there was a mix up with the insurance and now I'm going to owe them a significant amount which I don't have the money of exchange to cover. What I would like to do is approach the dentist and offer a contract with him to give me a bill and I'll endorse it. However, I don't know what to tell him about the process for him to follow in order for him  to receive his money of account to cover the value of the service he provided me. Secondly, does this make me a freeloader on the land? Thirdly, be gentle, I'm just trying to survive the consequences of my lack of awareness and ignorance about this life:P",
