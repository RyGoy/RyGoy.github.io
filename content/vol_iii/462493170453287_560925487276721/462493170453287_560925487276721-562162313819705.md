   "message": "sleeping till 11 for some can be the right thing to value. especially when one cant get to sleep till sunrise.\n\ni dont typically eat (all day) till ~10pm, because then once i eat, i want to keep eating. all the stores are closed by 11pm around these parts except for 'quickie mart' and thats a 20 minute ride. so i eat less and value sleep. (lost another 5er, down to 185 from 218~), and i lost 30# eating macdonnalds!\n\nand instead of buying food (somthing that can expire), i may buy a piece of silver and touch that for a few hours!
