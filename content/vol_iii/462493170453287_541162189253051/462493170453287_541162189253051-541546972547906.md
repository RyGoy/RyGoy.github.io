   "message": "This is an incredibly insightful, yet horrific documentary. And S�il Eile, you have to admit that people just do not WANT TO SEE... Its funny cause we refuse to be FICTIONS... but that is the only way you can watch this... just as a fiction would see this... a robot. I guess in that respect, it shows how full of propaganda we are. Some of the TV shows they presented here I was actually going to google �no TV for like 12 years... See the intrigue that almost got me already? :/",
