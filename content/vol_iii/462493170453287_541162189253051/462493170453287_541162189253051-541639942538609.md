   "message": "i had to give up tv & radio about 3 years ago now Beverly.... i kept shouting at them lol before i gave up TV i began watching RT & Al jacira rather than sky & irish news but soon realised in was still propoganda....It was just INTENDED for a different audience.just a different type of control. define someone else as evil & set yourself apart & then you are unquestionably the opposite in their minds. I didn't want to see the reality of my life but i was forced to. We grow up into society accepting that world as \"normal\", it is fed to us, people assume roles of authority over us & make decisions for us... & i accepted it all unquestionably.... in fact i even acted out on it later, i can claim it wasn't my fault BUT without taking responsibility for it , i cant escape it. We cant be sure that N. Korea had anything to do with this, while honest in many respects this video is still somebody elses propoganda.",
