   "message": "Today is a sad day for me. I contend that we should consider putting the TFL Flag at half mast today. :(\n\nAs someone who joined the military at 17, thinking I was a defender of �all that is good and right in the world\"; the following causes me great emotional pain. To state the obvious, IT JUST ISN'T FAIR!\n\nhttp://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/americas/article3849123.ece\n\nIn my humble opinion, given the �shananigans� the elites have been up to, this may very well represent the most important of all the �David and Goliath� battles in our time. It is a symbol of all that is wrong and all the wrong that is coming. \n\nOn the one hand, OUR PRIVACY must be infringed in today's post 911 world, while THEIR PRIVACY must be considered \"the holy of holys\". There must be a hole somewhere in that legal argument.\n\nCould the PUNDITS in this group provide any help to this hero? Is the government�s �legal knot� just too advanced for even the very best amongst us? I understand that this could scare away even the bravest and most capable legal rebels amongst us.\n\nAs in the film Good Will Hunting, �The gauntlet has been dropped!�",
