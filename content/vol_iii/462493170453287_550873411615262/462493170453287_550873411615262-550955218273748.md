   "message": "Something big must be happening. All sorts of crazy shit is going on all over the world. Harper's set to PROROGUE in CANADA again at the same time the Middle East is in turmoil, as there is some sort of event planned in FEMA zone 3 (USA) around the same time... Over here (Thailand)the majority in Parliament is refusing to allow the opposition to debate, resulting in chaos in Parliament - brawls with the boys in brown protecting the \"majority\" (bought and paid for election) Rumors are flying of another coup here.. Fukushima, Sakurijima... Earthquakes. All a coincidence? Shit's hit the fan !",
