   "message": "This reminds me of a few years ago, I was in PEI and went to the Mi'kmaq reserve. I knew nothing then other then I had heard reserve conditions were atrocious and wanted to see for myself. The housing  was quite a small area and the houses were is rough shape. However one thing that stood out to me was the church that was on the reserve. It was massive and in perfect condition. My thoughts at that time were, why is the Catholic Church so predominant in this community, it didn't make any sense to me even with the limited knowledge I had at that time.",
