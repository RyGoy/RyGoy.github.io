   "message": "I am in agreement with CHRISTOPHER BEACH with his words about the destruction on Our Peoples Home Lands and the planned GENOCIDE/KILLING off of Our Peoples, with man made up laws .. Treaties are tricks/spells, for these words are man made up laws .. Since contact we have no, never heard or witnessed the truth in the man made up words in trick treaties .. The original TREATIES .. Are only TREATIES OF PEACE .. NO, NEVER treaties for any Land Mass .. When Christopher Beach refers to us as aboriginal, he at this point agreed with a corporate word to self terminate him self and ALL those agreeing to be called aboriginal or the other corporate made up words of : indian : indigenous : 1st nations : native : metis, these are trick words to help the corporations end their INDIAN PROBLEM, to kill us off and steal Our Home Lands, by admiralty law, maritime law, that we have abandoned Our Home Lands, through trick words to cast a spell of an image we gave up, and their illusion is, they own Our Peoples Home Lands .. In writing request canada and its provincial corporations Our Peoples Ancient Ones could put a signature on paper when they did not know how to write in english .. So request for a wet ink insturment (document) with Our Peoples Ancients Ones true signature .. All signatures were written by priests, british agants of the crown, crown templar .. No not by Our Peoples Ancient Ones, for the fact they did not know english contract law, so every thing done since then is a fraud, and the fraud happening now is the indian act SECTION 74 chief and council employees of : crown, crown templar, canada and its provincial corporations, ALL these are working together to kill us off ....\n\nChristopher Beach ï¿½>> At the same time, Aboriginal people gave up the majority of this wonderful country so non-Aboriginal people can live the good life with the promise of a treaty, which was never , in my opinion, honored in good faith.\n\nNon-Aboriginals forgot what life was like in their homeland where many died of starvation and were persecuted at the hands of their own people. Now that they had a taste of the good life, they want to further persecute Aboriginal people today in a similar way.\n\nAnd the survival rate was of Aboriginal babies was due to filthy Europeans who thought it was alright to spit on the floors and throw garbage into the same water they drank from.\nThey then bring those sicknesses they created by their stupidity from their countries, and come here and continue that way of life and thinking, infecting Aboriginal people and their babies. \n\nNow, these stupid same people's ancestors, want to destroy the rest of the country that they promised Aboriginal people, they would protect. Before European contact, there was 60 million Aboriginal people living on what was then know as Turtle Island , in harmony with all living things, no pollution.\n\nTwo hundred years later, most of our lakes and rivers are so contaminated, some lake, have become dead lakes which has no life at all. Its time for Aboriginal people to take a stand and say enough is enough, we have given more than enough and realize the Greed of Non-Aboriginal people is never satisfied and never ending.
