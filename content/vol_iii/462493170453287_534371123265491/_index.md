   "message": "In Canada our governments are in fact aiding and abetting criminal activity committed by corporations. The most important lesson we can learn is about human rights and equality. The fact that in Canada if you get hurt on the job and accept workers compensation insurance from any province means two things. Firstly you are promised at least 75% of wage loss and in many cases up to 100% and medical care will be provided for injuries. BUT! and this is where the crimes start, if you accept their offer legislation is in place to remove Canadians from the Canada health act and also remove a Canadians legal rights through Workers Compensation Acts. They don't tell you this when injured or before. Unfortunately there are hundreds if not thousands of Canadians murdered every year by the criminal activity of all Workers Compensation Boards and the corporations that cripple them. The blame lies squarely on governments shoulders for not protecting the working men and women of this country. In fact there are tens of thousands right now in Canada not being treated for Chronic Pain. As a result many commit suicide or die of stress from pain causing heart attacks, strokes, and ulcers. To ad to the trauma of the injured workers we are subjected to needless pointless psychologically abusive appeals process. Bottom line is this. If you get injured on the job in Canada you have absolutely no protection from criminal activity if you accept workers comp. Our governments are guilty of neglect and it is costing us our lives after injury. We can't get well, can't get back to work, because our medical care and wage loss benefits do not exist.. The whole system is a fraud leading to murder of patients.",
