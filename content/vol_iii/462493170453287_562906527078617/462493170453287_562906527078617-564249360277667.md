   "message": "I am purely involving the mortgage company because the mortgage was sent (via solicitor) back to them....this is the only part I can verify because they are the only party I dealt with.  \n\nWhatever the mortgage company has subsequently done, I have no evidence & no idea.\n\nNow the 'loan' part of the relationship is over, they are the people I want the security back from....where they get it (or the equivalent value) from is not my concern.",
