   "message": "When one applies for a loan/mortgage, is the \"note\" signed first and lodged as an asset?\n\nThen the man/woman return as the debtor to sign the contract?\n\nI ask because people make the point that if the note is sold on by the bank then they are not owed anything by the man/woman... But are the note and the contract 2 separate arrangements? Does the contract stand regardless of whether or not the note was sold on?",
