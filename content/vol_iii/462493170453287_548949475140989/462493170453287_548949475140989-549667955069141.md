   "message": "If it was me.... i think i'd be writing to the local authority asking them how the liability arose, do you own the house or not because what is yours cant be taxed. while BoE might solve a payment issue, it doesn't resolve the fraud on your person. lack of understanding negates contract so ask them the difficult questions,i'd CC the guy in the revenue so they cant act against you.",
