   "message": "If you ever go to call Equifax, know you will receive the Philippines and not a Canadian on Canadian soil. If you request to speak to a Canadian on Canadian soil they will not transfer you but give you another number 1-877-323-2598 to the QUE for the Quebec office.\n\nToday, after being on the phone for over a half hour and several attempts to communicate with a human, I finally got through to the Customer Service Dept for correcting discrepancies. You see, I.C.B.C. applied a debt (not belonging to me) on my credit report and I have been trying to have removed for more than two years. Of course, this directly effects my rating and subsequently my credit.\n\nI really don�t understand why it is me who has to work this out for them seeing it wasn�t me who created the debt, nor was I the one who is unable to correctly manage the account, nor was I the one who accept the file or attach it to my bureau report. It seems as though I am the only one with the desire to remove it. One would think they would want to track down the correct person to recoup their debt.\n\nThe Phlip I first spoke to spoke english barely and was either deliberately difficult or he was just stupid. Raymond-8991 told me he was in Canada though he was not a Canadian citizen. I requested to speak with a supervisor but he refused to escalate the call. He would not give me the name of the supervisor nor would he do anything to correct the reason for my call. He ended up hanging up on me because I asked him if he knew of a law which requires Canadian companies servicing Canadians to supply calls, if requested, to be directed to a Canadian on Canadian soil.\n\nI called back (again) and spoke with a female who answered my questions to only inform me that they were a call center in the Philippines and they were not Canadian citizens. I tried to make a complaint about Raymond however she refused to take it and directed me to call this number, the one above. She would not release the name of the business she worked for. I asked to speak to a supervisor but again, she refused.\n\nSorry for the semantics but I am a little aggravated at the moment. I am so pissed and need this gone. Sure would be nice to recoup something for my time and inconvenience as well.\n\nI am new to this and will take a wild stab and say I need 2 affidavits to inform them of the circumstances and a fee schedule to bill for future time and inconveniences if required. Send one to ICBC and another to Equifax. Of course, I have absolutely no idea how to do this and humbly request the wisdom of TENDER FOR LAW.",
