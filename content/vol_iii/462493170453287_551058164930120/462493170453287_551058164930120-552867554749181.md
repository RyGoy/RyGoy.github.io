   "message": "Amusing response however until this is off my bureau, I will still make every effort for them to retract it and then, and only then, will I allow it to be in the past.\n\nThat said, Equifax continues to allow what I deem slanderous being I am not involved with the ICBC claim. ICBC will not talk with me about it as they know it is not mine and say it is against their privacy policy. Equifax has held a dispute for over 2 years with nothing new since.\n\nWhat about a \"cease and desist\"?",
