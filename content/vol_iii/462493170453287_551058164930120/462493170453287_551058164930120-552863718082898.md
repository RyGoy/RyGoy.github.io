   "message": "\"I am still searching for a remedy\" = \"Still invested in the past\".\n\nSorry you were victimized by frauds. There's no \"remedy\". Anyone who says there is, is in fact LYING TO YOU.\n\nThey're FRAUDS. There is no remedy.\n\nPersonally, I target individuals who participate in it, against me. If you act against my interests, I'll wait a few years, and then cripple you (kneecaps drilled out, cut off foot, etc.) and then I slaughter your children. They work for the government. Their offspring lives off of YOUR victimization.\n\nSo if you are a Lawyer/Officer or any such agent who has wronged me personally... Don't get too attached to those children. ;)",
