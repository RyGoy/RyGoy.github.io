   "message": "Ive requested true original copies of all the standing ORDERS with my name on them. I'm going to VOID these orders when i recieve these copies.. \"NEW ORIGINAL\" after VOIDing these documents where do i send them? To the court clerks office? And my probation officer has a copy of the ORDER so when i don't show up next month he's going to think he has the authority to come and hunt me down. So does he get a copy too?",
