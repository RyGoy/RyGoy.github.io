   "message": "John Doe \nThe Office of the Revenue Commissioners\nLPT Branch\nPO Box 1\nLimerick\nIreland\n\nTo John Doe in your private capacity.\nI refer to your notice dated 30/6/2013\nYour reference to My Property: *******\n\nMy name is *** Mason and my title is under the birth notification form and my status is as a woman of original jurisdiction with inherent rights and inherent power. \nI hereby claim allodial title over all my property and possessions.\n\nI am not an officer, agent, trustee, or employee of The Government of Ireland.\n\nIn regards to your notice, I rebut everything you said or stated in it.\nYour office has been contacted in regards to this alleged Household Charge and Local Property Tax. I am not liable for the Household Charge or the Local Property Tax.\nI have the poof of delivery from An Post.\n\nThis will be the last time that I contact you about this matter as I have, on previous occasions, informed you of my position and of yours i.e. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners.\n\nI never agreed to register for the Household Charge, Local Property Tax, or give you The Office of the Revenue Commissioners free money.\nI never gave you permission to contact my previous employer.\n\nThere appears to be a mistake as although the included correspondence was sent to *** MASON the correspondence implies that an obligation was against �You�. Would you (John Doe) in your private capacity kindly confirm who �You� is, and/or forward this correspondence to You.\n\nI have no knowledge of who �You� and/or �*** MASON� and/or any such other identification your department/you and/or The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has addressed me as. I respectfully ask; by what authority is The Office of the Revenue Commissioners addressing me as such? \nPlease define what a liable person is please under your acts and statutes?\nAs I am not a qualified solicitor or barrister I do not understand acts and statutes, as such I will not be forced to agree or be held liable for something I do not understand.\n\nThe Office of the Revenue Commissioners are under no circumstances to withdraw or steal money from my private pension, as I have not given *** BUIDING SOCIETY, you or The Office of the Revenue Commissioners permission to do so and I will never give my permission for you or The Office of the Revenue Commissioners to take money from me without my written consent.\n\nIt seems to me that in the matter for surety for the LEGAL NAME,  I believe that there has been a mistake as the sole beneficiary has been incorrectly identified, therefore under no circumstances are you or The Office of the Revenue Commissioners to be party to the theft of my money.\n\nWhat evidence does The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have that I am a trustee and have any surety with respect to the LEGAL NAME?\n\nWhat evidence does The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a TRUSTEE or an EMPLOYEE of The Government of Ireland?\n \nThere is no evidence that there has been any meeting of the minds, any proper notice given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or that I have any intent to contract in this matter.\n\nI have no obligation to file any such Local Property Tax (LPT) Return.\n\nYou (John Doe) are on Notice that if you, your office/The Office of the Revenue Commissioners steal money from me in an unlawful action from my private\npension without my written permission I will be holding you (John Doe) personally liable in your private capacity and I may be seeking An Garda S�och�na to investigate your (John Doe) actions under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Persons Act, 1997 and/or Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001.\n\nAs such, I am returning your OFFER, DECLINED, for immediate DISCHARGE and CLOSURE.\n\nNotice: Failure by you (John Doe) in your private capacity to respond within 7 (SEVEN) days of receipt of this correspondence shall constitute legal accord and satisfaction of all claims.\n\nYours in truth, sincerity and honour,\n\nAUTHORZIED BY______________________          DATE____________________\nMason\nSigned in the capacity of an inherent woman of original jurisdiction.\nAll rights reserved\n\nI could only attach one scan of their response with this post so the second will be added on a seperate post.",
