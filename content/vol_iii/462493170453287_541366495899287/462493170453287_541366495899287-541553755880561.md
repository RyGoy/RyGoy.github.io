The remaining 95% of the time is spent verifying and attempting to piece each part into the reality of today so that I may better comprehend the current and future reality.\nI am gearing up for the future with a definite plan for the benefit of my family. I do expect a bullseye target on my head in the near future.\nEvery one wants to have **** Freedom**** which is a fallacy.\nThe more you know and start to assert your rights you realize you have more responsibilities then before you were ****Free**** . You will never be Free until the Common Actions of the worlds Governments change coarse 180 degrees and the general populace starts behaving in a responsible manner.\nThe sad thing is, is that this will never happen. Obtaining true freedom just means more responsibilities there by destroying the very freedom fought for.\nA Slave has more freedom since all he has to do is Follow orders given to him.\nThe ones in charge might have more luxuries and better homes and vacations but it is a one way ticket. They Must hold their position or fail utterly. Revolutions thru out mans history prove this.\nThere will always be a need of leaders as most men/women are only capable of following not leading.\nThe qualities of the leaders is what I think most here want to change for the better. By learning our Responsibilities we each in turn Force the currant leaders direction just a bit into the proper direction.\nThe more you learn the more you realize that the knowledge and consequent action of using the knowledge comes great Responsibilities and liabilities.\nSht I shouldn't post after drinking 20 cups of coffee.",
