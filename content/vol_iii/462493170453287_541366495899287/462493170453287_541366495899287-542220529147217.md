   "message": "David Johansen, if you can prove they are going outside their jurisdiction with some one else yes you can harm their revenue. If you see any one harm another if you do not assist then you agree to the crime and would be in fact a party to it if you did Nothing. Calling 911 against an officer abusing his jurisdiction is at least some thing. Kicking them in the head is a better option, then call 911.",
