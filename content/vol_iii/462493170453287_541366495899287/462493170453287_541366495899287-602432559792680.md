   "message": "Scott Duncan I can ONLY LEGALLY answer the \"right questions\" or clarify what you already know.\n\nVERY few are doing anything about the financial system, but that doesn't mean NOBODY is. Some of us are doing something.\nI'm one of them.\n\nThe problem is that nobody's qualified to understand the issues. That's my goal here (And MANY other places); To get people aware enough to control their own lives.\n\nA lifetime of experience has shown me that people are really grateful for that shit I have surfed on the fortunes of the grateful for most of my life. Now I need more... A LOT more.\n\nI'll do my best to help you not be a slave, but it's in your nature, and you (the majority) love your chains.\n\nYour bullshit filter will get a workout here. I do this test knowing all the answers. You're \"playing poker and holding the cards the wrong way\"...and you haven't even noticed. You're all focused on the rules, and ignoring that ugly reality; I CAN SEE ALL YOUR CARDS!",
