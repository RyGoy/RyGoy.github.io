   "message": "Also Scott, its not just about being interested in WHAT you have to say. Part of it is the what, but anyone can talk about this stuff, and most don't find much of an interested audience.\n\nThe difference, isn't in the WHAT you have to say, but in the fact that you are actually saying it AND doing it. Not just behind closed doors, but publicly. You say the what. Then you ACT on the what.\n\nFinding people who walk their talk, is a rarity.(At least if their talk isn't bullshit.)\n\nSo we don't have much exposure to what happens to people that do as you've done.",
