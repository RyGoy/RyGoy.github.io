   "message": "Problem with playing this game, is that everything seems to be on the line.(At least it feels that way)\n\nAnd gambling everything, in a game I don't understand, against the house(those running the game) seems ill-advised.\n\nTwo thoughts come to mind:\n\n-The only way to win, is not to play the game.\n-You can't win if you don't play the game.",
