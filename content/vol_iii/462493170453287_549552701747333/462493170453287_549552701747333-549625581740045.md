   "message": "Reminds me of a guy I met a couple of years ago. His wife was a naturopath and found out she had breast cancer. Because of her \"faith in god\" and natural remedy belief, she refused to get any real medical help.\n\nShe died, of course.\n\nLeft him with 3 kids to take care of. He was actually pretty pissed off with her.",
