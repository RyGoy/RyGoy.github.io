   "message": "Anna you need to learn what money is, and NEVER use \"natural news\" as a source. EVER.\n\nThis was last April and I thought I was done pointing this out, but if I must again:\n\nBTC's value was around $100, and the banks tried to pump-and-dump it. When they tried to crash it, it IMMEDIATELY snapped back to its previous value. There's no \"bank\" to react. It's just ignorant people panicking...and in this case, lying through omission.\n\nDid you watch the required viewing?\nI don't think you have. You clearly have NO clue what MONEY is, muchless what Bitcoin is.\n\nPlease stop talking out of your ass. I have to clean up the misinformation that sort of thing spreads.",
