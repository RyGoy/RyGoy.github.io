   "message": "I�ve been thinking currency for a few days, IN ENGLISH, first time in my life I catch myself so often THINKING in English, anyway, I start seeing people as DEBT , but that is another story.\n\nMy question is: Using BITCOIN as money of exchange to live my life seems to free �ME� from lots of troubles, and I like it.\n\nBut I am wondering WHO can pretend having AUTHORITY to make �ME� show them ANY record and/or accounting books about �MY� BITCOIN usage ?\n\nI see NO ONE, but I think the question is VALUABLE.\n\nThanks\n\"ME\"",
