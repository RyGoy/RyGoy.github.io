Thanks Pete, in my affidavit I claimed my right to invoice, the invoice was omitted so as not to be vexatious, the invoice goes out with the Notice of Default. is this better? Notice of DEFAULT.\n\nBe advised, since you haven't responded to my Affidavit, and haven't challenged my right to invoice, we have no other choice than to send you this notice of default.\n\nWe are nice folks, so we will give you an extra 3 days to pay the amount claimed.\n\nIf we do not receive payment, we will follow up with the LIEN process\n\nWithout ill will.\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED / NO PREJUDICE\n\nAuthorized By:_________________ Sole Authorized Administrator for the Person named David Vilaca, inscription # XXX XXX XXX",
