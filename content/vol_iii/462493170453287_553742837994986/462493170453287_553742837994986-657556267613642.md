   "message": "As copy holder I have the ticket before me, Metzger (total blonde bimbo) struck out the DL section even thought the # was on the CPIC, even the address is struck out twice before she got the spelling right (which I gave knowing it did not match the DL I had at home) there is nothing to prove joinder. When Metzger passed the ticket to me, I accepted on condition she admit she is a peace officer in the common law jurisdiction, she told me to take the ticket or go to jail that night. tell me how should I have acted with VEGA being a bull on parade?",
