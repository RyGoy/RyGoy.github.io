   "message": "Claim received by both the City and Granite. City has a file # that differs from the adjusters file #. My Claim, invoice and affidavit of obligation are registered via mail. How should I proceed? The cops will fault and default with non-response to the affidavit while Granite is investigating, do I send notice of fault to all 4 parties (2 cops,1 Clerk, 1 adjuster) or do I just default the cops and add it to the claim?",
