   "message": "What are the rolls being played here, City Clerk (Ulli S Watkiss )failed to reply with a signature while the adjuster sent wet ink with his reply. The City letter is mistakenly addressed to all caps while the adjusters is mistakenly addressed to the person in my pocket. None of the replies was by registered mail. The Clerk and the adjuster mistakenly addressed me, both were directed to address me as david vilaca (I know this is not possible) in private. Are the File #s separate Accounts (for the person addressed)  Do I append the file# to the registered notice of fault mailing for each agent/agency. If the file is an account it must be settled via the invoice. I'm confused, they are using 3 different names for 1 claim.",
