   "message": "Thanks to all for the help, with all the shit going on in my life, looking for a new place to live, packing, work calls and the claims I have in motion it is hard for me to focus. If Karen had taken the time to understand how important it is to resign from the fraud then we would be stronger, instead she is choosing to vote and I just can't live in two parallel worlds, I can no longer support stupid cunt syndrome as it leaves me detached from the love we once had for each other. Karen is a great woman, I love her like no other, if I stand with her we will loose everything as she is the weak link and will turn on me through ignorance. She fears the system, that fear is stronger than love and in the end it will destroy us both.",
