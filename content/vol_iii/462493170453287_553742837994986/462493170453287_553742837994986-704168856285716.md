   "message": "I know about your situation, Chris. How can I put myself in your shoes? I cannot. I have never been in such situation. It  must suck, to put it in lame words.\n\nWhat I meant with my comment is that anything from the past, is wrong thinking. Our thinking, even in terms of LAW, must be in the FUTURE, and that \"future\" in here NOW. Unfolding. \n\nDecentralized technologies, smart contracts, coding, Namecoin, 3D printing technologies, computer science, new services for a new era, etc. Even if one is in prison, that is the stuff that can actually help to \"better ourselves.\"\n\nWe are better investing our time acquiring knowledge about the future, instead of 12 USC 95a(2) (which is some Clubhouse rule that will probably be gone in 10 years or less), we come better off. \n\nI am empathetic to your situation, Chris. Just think about what I just said.",
