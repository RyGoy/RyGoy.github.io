   "message": "excerpt from affidavit of truth. On August 16th 2013 approximately 8:38:00 pm, I was stopped at Queen St E and Greenwood Ave by Toronto Police Services Officers Vega #5438 and Metzger #90170 of Unit D55. At the time, I was riding an E-Bike in my private capacity. Officer Metzger asked where my helmet is and I responded with �I am an adult and do not need one�. Officer Metzger then asked if they could talk to me and I responded with �no thanks� negating consent to further intercourse. \n Officer Metzger then stepped out of car 5506 and told me I need to wear a helmet as per the Highway Traffic Act. I asked Metzger what the Highway Traffic Act means? Metzger, unwilling to provide service then asked for identification of which I did not have at the time and informed her of such. Metzger stated I needed to give my name and so I replied �by what authority do you ask me for my private name?� it was at this point Officer Vega exited the car with anger and malice and asked what my name was, it was then that I stated David. Both Officers then attempted to compel me to provide a name (SURNAME, D.O.B. and address) via threats of detention. Contrary to the Officers memorandum book notes, I was not waiving my hands around and spitting on them (why no charges if this is true), the claim that I was belligerent is fallacious and fraudulent, I had to raise my voice to assert my right to ask a question, I again stated �by what authority do you ask me for my private name? Officer Vega then violently forced me into submission and placed restraints upon my wrists with enough force to make me cry out in pain while publicly humiliating my dignity. Officer Vega began to twist back and forth the bindings and apply more force while asking me for my name, I again cried out in pain and asked the people at the bus stop to film my torture.\nRealizing my friend had left in fear and that I had no witness, I was compelled under duress, fear, coercion and torture to provide my private name. Under duress I gave my real name (first and family name) and invoked my right to remain silent.\n Officer Vega continued to torture me in his attempt to extort and coerce from me, my standing on my common law right to remain silent. While Vega is using force to compel information I�m now shouting at Officer Metzger if this is the behavior of common law peace officers and ask her to stop VEGA from torturing me. At this point the in-car camera is triggered (Timestamp 20:43:20) and VEGA is recorded still torturing me (2 mins duration?) while pretending to release the excessive bindings as Metzger is asking me to clam down. Officer Vega then further restricts the binding on my left wrist to the extent of creating hostility and ill will by pinching a nerve, I inform VEGA charges are to follow (my language is such that my suffering and duress is evident) VEGA places me in car 5506 with bindings still being used to remove my singularly human rights and compel information via the inhuman condition of torture, bondage and servitude to public servants of HER MAJESTY IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO. \nAt no time was I informed of any of my rights before during or after detention and interrogation. No officer was concerned that torture was being used to produce information, in fact Office Metzger clearly states on video, �the cuffs are not meant to be comfortable� while I inform her of international law and the conditions I am being forced to endure. \n During my detention and interrogation no joinder was created between the public name and the private name provided, identification was provided by a private member of the public. C.P.I.C. had no information and no photographs available to identify me. All information provided by me was provided under duress, threat, intimidation, coercion and torture. \n As I was under physical restraint, pain and mental anguish I never willfully consented to any interaction, I continued to ask that I be freed so that we could converse as reasonable adults. Both officers were more concerned about the legal name and ensuing bill of exchange than my suffering and arbitrary detention.",
