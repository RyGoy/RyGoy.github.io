   "message": "Don't get caught!\n\nRemember the Scott Duncan rules for a successful Homicide!\n\n1: WAIT - Never kill in anger. WAIT A MINIMUM of 1900 DAYS! YES 1900. If you still think the cop/lawyer/justice and/or their offspring should die, after 1900 days, then they should probably be killed, because if YOU feel that way, the odds are 100% that a lot of others feel this way, too! \n\nI call this \"Padding the suspect list\".\n\n2: Use MODERN weapons. For 60 dollars you can build detonators triggered by your target's RFID badge. All government workers have them. USE THEM. RFID is VERY easy to clone/capture. Let them be the trigger, so you can be FAR AWAY.\n\n3. Get 3rd parties to execute your tasks. :D Couriers are a good option, when a mailbox won't do. Unlike The Unibomber, your bombs can be hidden in fancy cases that look like an expensive electronic gift (See D-Link Boxee) that will deliver its explosive payload to its intended target and nobody else. Learn the art of \"remote kills\", ala \"Law Abiding Citizen/Engineer\".\n\nhttp://youtu.be/HjGrHBpfqCo",
