That does not mean I am either right, or wrong. \n\nI have learned in TT4L that you never talk to cops, and that there is ways to create joinder and/or help in the presumption by giving a name, address, etc. \n\nAlso, I heard of not appealing to your rapist.\n\nMy assertion was based on watching the video. But I am not Scott Duncan, or someone that know that much.\n\nBut maybe you know something I don't (which is very likely), and I wanted to understand what was the base for doing all this.\n\nI have been reading what you have kept posting to understand more. I am still not fully clear, but I think all you want is compensation for violation of your common law rights, it's what I get.\n\nI wish you well, and I will keep reading what will come of all this David!",
