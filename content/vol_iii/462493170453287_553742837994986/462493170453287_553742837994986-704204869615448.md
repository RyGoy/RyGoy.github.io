   "message": "Chris: I had a recent encounter in the courts where they took my persons drivers licence. when I was stupid enough to go into the courts to have a motion heard to try and \"beg\" or reason for it back the justice gave me a motion denied paper  stating once drivers licence is suspended, the courts don't have jurisdiction to deal with me. I then was asked how I wished to proceed and I closed a four year ongoing bullshit case in a matter of minutes. I will post it all when I have a chance to type it all out ,but let me tell the world that the notice of mistake saved me from a lot of bs. ill get to what happened in court asap. PS ...giving up is what they want you to do. they will test you until you either push through or give up. I would never go into battle with anyone that would just put down their sword and die so sharpen that fucker up and get in the fight!",
