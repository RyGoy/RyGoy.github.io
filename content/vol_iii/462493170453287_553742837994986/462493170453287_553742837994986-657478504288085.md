   "message": "I am really trying to understand what is it that you are trying to do/accomplish, David. I am confused.\n\nWhat were you forced to do? :/  All I see is someone acting as a witness against himself, and voluntarily answering questions. Something I don't get is: if you ended-up answering all the questions they asked you, and more, why not answer their questions from the beginning?\n\nI know it's criminal for thugs with guns to detain you/us, but when you act like you know exactly what is happening, and you are \"cooperating\", you are telling them to \"talk this out like adults\", you even took a statutory ticket, then I don't see a victim, but a complying citizen. They had a statutory interaction with you, and you identified the person as you. They had your girlfriend as a witness to identify you, as well. And you took the ticket.\n\nNo one forced you to say anything. You answered all they asked. Where is the extortion part of this? :/\n\nYou should not be detained, and treated as a criminal until proven otherwise, but why call attention by not wearing the helmet? :/ Don't take me wrong, but I am really trying to understand what you are doing.  \n\nI wish you well, David!",
