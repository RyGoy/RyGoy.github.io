   "message": "Scott Duncan, any idea why my criminal history has been wiped from CPIC, could it be that the Justice Department deleted that info after my claim of right was established. I have a lengthy record from my youth (assault police, assault, and many drug charges). When the persons Drivers Licence was brought up on the in car computer no picture was available, in fact no pictures of me are on their system even thought I have been finger printed and photographed many times, what gives? Also, is it best to send the invoice via the sole proprietorship, I have yet to charter ESC CRTL and created the deed for the living trust. From what I understand a private man can send a bill to anyone.",
