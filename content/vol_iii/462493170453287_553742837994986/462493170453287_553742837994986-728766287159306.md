   "message": "Yes David-Paul Sip, I will indeed ask that very question and a few others as well. Once the formal resignation is in place. It's kinda laughable when you look at all that is wrong with the reply. It starts with a YOU FFS and omits the affirmation (sent registered mail ) and how the identity was ascertained, torture is routine in roadside intercourse, there is no other way to compel information when one chooses to remain silent.  My very first question \"by who's authority? on August 16th 2013 set the stage for the actors and the breach of trust. ESC CTRL has damaged the BC and SIN #'s, I need only send the formal resignation, return ALL of zepapers, (PASSPORT, LICENSE ect) to complete my private standing. Thereafter, some one I trust will correct this, The intent is to DAMAGE reputations on the blockchain and see this never happens again.",
