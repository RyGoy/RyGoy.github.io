   "message": "Sheerien Carter, I'm descended from the makers of the \"Rabbit Hole\" and is just second nature to me. I got \"kicked out\" because I didn't want to be a parasite. I have NO right to live at the expense of my fellow man. I just don't.\n\n......yet my fellow man is a evil, ignorant, violent, untrustworthy, sheep. It's been a problem since childhood.\n\nI've done my best to \"infect\" them with ethics, and knowledge... but it is futile.\n\nI'm on my last push. People who choose ignorance, are PREY, not partners. I shall be using them as such, soon.\n:(",
