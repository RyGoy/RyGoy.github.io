   "message": "The people haven't \"taken their power back\". The Egyptian military is ALLOWING them to (peacefully) protest, so they can publicly oust Morsi under the appearance of \"working WITH the people\", as long as they STAY peaceful. \n\nI think the important question to be asking is, what do they think the Military Police are going to do once THEY have seized control? I'm SURE number 1 on their to-do list is going to be the setting up of a nice, Democratic election...",
