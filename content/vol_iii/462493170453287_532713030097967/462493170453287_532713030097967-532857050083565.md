   "message": "\"the military on behalf of the people allowed it to happen\"...you honestly think that the people controlling all of the guns and power, did this for \"the people's\" behalf? Do you reeeeeaaaally believe that after all the celebrating last night, the NICE armed forces woke up this morning, bright-eyes and bushy-tailed, and started implementing a new regime FOR the people's best interests?\n\nWith no president, the military is in charge at the moment. They also have the weapons, and numbers, to maintain that control. Why would they give it up, out of the goodness of their hearts? Not very likely...",
