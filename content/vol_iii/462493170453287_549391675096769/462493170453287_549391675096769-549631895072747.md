   "message": "Did you read my paperwork that I posted sometime back it was constructed with the direct/in person help (he did all the work) of Chief Rock and a Notary. I don't think there was a comment or even a like on that thread. Nevertheless it is filled with gems of info crafted by someone who Scott Duncan regularly endorses. Scott's approval of the ChiefRock Sino General gives me enough bravado on this point to suggest I may be right. (Until such time as I am corrected) :)",
