   "message": "We think Wrong and Value the wrong things....\n\n     Because we are ignorant... an ignorance that has been cultivated in a                  \n     multi-pronged approach by what we call society. \n    \n     I have tremendous empathy and compassion for my fellow humans.\n     I love my friends and family...\n    \n      I fucking despise Bullies.. and have stood my ground and protected                 \n      the little guy.    I am 6' 3\"\n\n     I do not know enough, yet, I concede to this fact....\n\n     When do you think we will be ready to know what the right things to value are?\n     \n     I do know that this system has been highjacked.. by the LAW society...\n      The hijackers have disguised themselves in THE CROWN in Right of   Canada.... The Bankers and Media... and in other ways I do not know...\n\n     I started on this road when severe grievous bodily harm was caused to my vessel..  ME  \n     I started studying LAW about a year prior to being invited to this forum in order to exact remedy from the fuckers....\n\n     I stand ready to learn and be educated to what is right...\n\n     So, Please Scott Duncan could you expand upon what to VALUE ...\n\n     The clock is ticking we do not have much time from what I see around us.\n    \n      AM I Wrong?\n       \n       Are we not products of the successful implementation of the NOBLE \n       LIE?     ( which isn't really noble at all )\n      A lifetime of programming is difficult but not impossible to overcome.\n      I do not believe in much anymore.\n      \n      The TENDER FOR LAW is dispelling a lot of the myths....\n\n       I know I do not have anything you want currently.\n\n       I am working hard to read and learn as much as I can...\n\n       What do you recommend to speed up the process?\n\n                                                        HUMBLY,\n                                                          Jay",
