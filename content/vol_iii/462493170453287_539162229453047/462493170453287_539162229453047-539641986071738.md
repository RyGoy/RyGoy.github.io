   "message": "nobody can answer those questions for you lads, Those values must be inherent, they must shine out of you. I lost everything... cough... fuckin everything lol, i live very modestly now, while many around me have pity in their eyes when they consider the \"percieved\" loss/fall i've had. I am the only man i know that doesn't moan about money or circumstances. I dont allow others pollute me any more with their self inflicted problems, thats not malicious, just survival for the time being, no radio, TV or newspapers, i enjoy the simple & free,.... actually i value it ;)",
