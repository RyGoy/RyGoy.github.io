   "message": "but it's  CATCH 22, For Pete Daoust :\nA catch-22 is a paradoxical situation in which an individual cannot or is incapable of avoiding a problem because of contradictory constraints or rules.[1] Often these situations are such that solving one part of a problem only creates another problem, which ultimately leads back to the original problem. Catch-22s often result from rules, regulations, or procedures that an individual is subject to but has no control over. An example could be someone locking their keys in their vehicle. The keys are needed to unlock the door, but the keys are inside the locked vehicle. ( wikipedia)",
