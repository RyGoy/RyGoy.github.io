   "message": "Gail-inspired- Scott on how you end-up fucking yourselves when you get MARRIED \"the ole'fashioned way\"- thread.....\n\nScott Duncan: Well if you are CURRENTLY married, you are CURRENTLY fucked. It's a bill of lading that secures your PERSONS in the same way Rogueupport has secured Tara and My \"PERSONS\".\n\nScott Duncan: You need the government's PERMISSION to disolve the \"bill of lading\". We only require the SHAREHOLDER'S permission...and they're WAY nicer than the government.\n\nGail Blackman: Can I send them a Notice of Mistake?\n\nScott Duncan: No, because YOU WERE CAUTIONED before the \"I Do's\". \n\nPete Daoust: Is there a specific reason to bring to the goverment, where they have NO CHOICE but to grant PERMISSION?\n\nScott Duncan: Nope. It's LAW now. Only a court can dissolve it.\n\nBOTH PARTIES (The GRANTORS) consented, and the TRUSTEE ratified it. You are fucked.\n\nGail Blackman: If both parties lien their names, then wouldn't that take the surety out of the equation?\n\nScott Duncan: That's \"WILFUL DAMAGE to a SECURITY INSTRUMENT\". The Marriage came first. IT has the claim, not you. Liening your name just makes you \"next in line\".\n\nPete Daoust: I wonder if there is LAWYERS that specialize in marriage dissolvement...??\n\nLike a package kit you know..???...for $1099.99 we disolve your marriage no question ask..type of thing\n\nScott Duncan: There are, but then they identify the split parties' assets and let the government know (As they are entitled to, according to the \"license\" you signed) so they have someone to \"legally\" targeted. (There's a paper trail, and therefore \"Proof\").\n\nPete Daoust: So whats the remedy..???\n\nJoel Kinmond: The remedy is you learn the hard way what happens when you break an oath.\n\nPete Daoust Gail Blackman, nice stuff here...lol..\nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/marriage\n\nCara Small Atherton: How about a DECREE that the signatures are now rescinded by free will of both parties and marriage is now and forever null and void?\n\nScott Duncan: That damages the security. The trustee you LICENSED from, will demand payment, which will, by happy coincidence, consist of everything you own.\n\nCara Small Atherton: If there is lien in place then our corp would be \"first in line\" (Scott clicked LIKE)",
