   "message": "This is the dumbest myth EVER. \"Prenuptial Agreements\" are the invention of lawyers, and don't actually DO anything, and if you intend to follow up with an \"I know a guy who knows a guy\" story contradicting that, I'll thank you for shutting your fucking pie-hole, and spare me the bullshit.\n\nIf you claim it was you, I'l just ban your ass for lying.\n\n...or you can NEVER mention \"Prenuptial Agreements\" EVER again. That works too.\n\nAny questions?",
