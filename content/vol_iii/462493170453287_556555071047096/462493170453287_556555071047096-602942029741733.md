   "message": "I saw an interview on TV one day with the \"top Hollywood divorce lawyer\" aired on the TMZ show while spending time somewhere nobody would ever enjoy and she has, if I remember correctly, 2 children from 2 different men I think and she never Married them, she said \"I know the law and a do not want the State dictating anything concerning my marriage\" so if an attorney won't marry because of the State then I think we or anyone who cares about this type of matter should take heed to her free TV advice.",
