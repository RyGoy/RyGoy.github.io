   "message": "Questions:  What if both the persons are liened into a private trust prior to the marriage, would they then be able to lien the married person into the private trust as well, as it is a product/consequence of the two persons?\n\nIf the married couple are now considered 'one person' legally, what is this new person's name?\n\nConsequently, wouldn't the new person's name be separate or different to each of the persons that combined to form the new person?\n\nAs the two comprising the new person are the only party(ies) that provide value, can the new person be liened into the private trust?\n\nApologies for dumping a bunch of questions here, but they bubbled to the surface while reading this thread.",
