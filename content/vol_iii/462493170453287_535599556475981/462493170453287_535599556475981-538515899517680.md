   "message": "I went today and tried to retrieve my two kids. I went down to get a notice of demand notarized. The lawyer refused to do it because he said that, even the prime minister couldn't void a court order. I told him that all he was doing was witnessing my signature. He stated that he knew the order couldn't be voided and that was untrue and there for he couldn't do his notarizing. But as I was leaving he did tell me that I could let him know how things turned out. Any ways as it turned out the foster parent had left and I scooted over to pick up the middle one, but to get the youngest one, was tougher and didn't happen. So she is still there in detention, poor baby. But we will try again. They did get wise to us trying to get Carole so we just let it go for today. As I was busy getting the kids the rcmp showed up at the house trying to serve the old man with failure to pay court fines. Any how it should be an interesting weekend. Very happy to have one home and looking forward to getting the other one.",
