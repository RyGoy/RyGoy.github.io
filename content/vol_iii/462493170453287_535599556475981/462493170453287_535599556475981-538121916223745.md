   "message": "A useful skill to develop...the art of \"Google-Fu\". My cell, (Yes, that BIG, obnoxious one again), has the Google app on the main screen. An instant search bar, which I use COUNTLESS times a day, to look up unknown things that I encounter. \n\nAnd that could be anything you come across, (Training yourself to become more observant and aware of your surroundings goes hand-in-hand with this). Words, businesses, things you hear on the radio or television. \n\nWhen you're outside, start looking UP. No one EVER looks up. The number of times each day that your image is caught on camera, is TRULY disturbing.",
