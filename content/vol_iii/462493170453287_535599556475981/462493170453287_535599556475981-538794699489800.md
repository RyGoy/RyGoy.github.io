   "message": "Derek Hill, I know that this works. DCS has not even bothered to phone me or send someone to get the kid at our home. however they have sent the kid a text telling her that they are all so worried and concerned for her safety, but they waited till 11 am the next morning to text her. I know that this works, It is just a matter of being able to get the youngest. I have my one hour visitation on Monday again. I know afterwards I will be going to the courthouse, lol, and asking for certified copies of the fine order and probation order. I'm sure they wont let me near the originals any more. Lol This is so much fun. It is wonderful to be able to get ahead of them for a change.",
