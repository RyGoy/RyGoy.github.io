   "message": "Well people, this morning went for my visit, and after I tried desperately to get one of those self-inking VOID stamps but none to be had in this small town. Got a red marker instead. Went down to the court house and asked to see the original court order. Family court clerk came out with an armful of files and papers and dug though the paper work and showed me the original order. But then she said that the original order had no force and effect that the last order was the one that had the force and effect. So my mind raced to make a decision with a 50/50 percent chance of being right. While the clerk was busy digging through the paper work, I brought out my red tip marker and set it where she couldn�t see it. But it rolled ahead any ways but she didn�t have a clue as to what I was going to do next. So I made the big instant decision that I would go with the order that had force and effect and looked for the last page. Took my red maker and wrote void on the last page with the signature on it. She watched me do this and I couldn�t see her expression at the time but I noticed that after I did this she became a little upset. She said, � I can�t believe you just did that. You know, that writing void on there doesn�t do anything, it is still a judges order.� I didn�t say anything, I just stood there waiting for her to call the sheriffs over or someone else. She didn�t she just started to put all of her paper work back in the folder and I just turned and walked out. I had parked my car elsewhere in case of anything and walked over to it and got in and drove away. I stopped off at my friendly neighborhood DCS office and dropped off this letter to them. \n\nI am a human being with inherent unalienable rights attached, I am not the legal person. I have pointed out to you and your agency that I don�t consent or contract with you. On numerous occasions I have declined and not consented to the Temporary Care and Custody Order. You have kidnapped my offspring and held them in detention without proof of claim. I have asked for such evidence and you have failed to produce it. I have asked for you to produce evidence that I am contracting with you or consenting and you have failed to produce it. You have failed to produce evidence that I have harmed or injured my offspring. The worst part is that when you took them into your �care�, did you do due diligence in establishing that my offspring where harmed in any way? No, and you have produced no such evidence. As a matter of FACT you chose to take 42 days to take them for a medical, although you claim that you took them in 30 business days. You at the onset of the Protection Application, had an opportunity to court order an assessment and chose not to. Where is your evidence that my offspring were emotionally harmed? You have none. All of your actions are unlawful. I now advise you that this morning I have voided the Temporary Care and Custody Order. I DEMAND that you return my offspring immediately to their mother and father before you cause any more damage or injury. YOU HAVE NO LEGAL OR LAWFUL RIGHT TO KEEP MY OFFSPRING.\n\nMy only question now is, did I pick the right order to void?",
