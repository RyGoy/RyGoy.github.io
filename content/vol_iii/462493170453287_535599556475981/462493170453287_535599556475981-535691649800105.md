   "message": "Good on ya Derek Hill. I have to think back a few years to when you were helping Terry and things did not turn out so well. How we have all changed over the years. Now, with the truth at hand, the fear now dissipating in all of us, we move forward, wielding our new found knowledge with confidence. I sent 2 notices of mistake off in the past 4 days. Canada Post tracking # RW748369655CA and RW785559225CA.The one I had a court date set already for July 16, so I wrote with a thick red sharpie across on the diagonal, CANCELLED, and sent it back. I cannot thank Scott Duncan enough.",
