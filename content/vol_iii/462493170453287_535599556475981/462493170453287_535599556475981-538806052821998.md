   "message": "I already went this morning to her camp and they sent three workers out, telling me that Im not allowed there. I was parked on the street. I told them this is public property and by what authority can they tell me that I can't be there? Well you know that you are not allowed around your daughter. So I don't want to create a scene, especially with all the other disabled children there. So I just thought that I would let it go till Monday, when I would be in a better position to deal with it.",
