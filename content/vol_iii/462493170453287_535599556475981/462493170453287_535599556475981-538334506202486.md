   "message": "Question Scott, if you wanted to VOID a marriage contract, could you implement it this way as well? I understand it is not a CLAIM directed toward your PERSON... and just a registered SECURITY. Then would it be that both PARTIES should get their hands on the original contract and VOID it? Or can just one of the PARTIES can do this?",
