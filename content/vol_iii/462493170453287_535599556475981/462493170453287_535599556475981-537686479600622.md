   "message": "I have imaginary balls, and I am going in deep. Tomorrow morning I have visitation at my friendly, backstabbing, lying and outrageous Department of Community Services to spend my allotted 1 hr twice a week with my girls. And after I will go down to the court house to either \"see\" the original or a certified copy of that Temporary Care and Custody Order. And when I leave there I will be returning back to the friendly DCS office and hand them a letter that the order has been voided and I demand the return of my offspring. And like Derek Hill I shall keep you posted. LOL I can hardly wait. This is going to be so much fun.",
