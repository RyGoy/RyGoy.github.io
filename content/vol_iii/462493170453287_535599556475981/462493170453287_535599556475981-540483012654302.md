   "message": "Oh how desperate these people have become. They are trying to move the contract by ignoring the notice of mistake. I think that this is how I would respond if not just to imagine the look on the face of the recipient.\nWhat they sent:\nNOTICE OF TRIAL\nRe: Blah��������..\nThis is to advise that the not guilty plea submitted has been received within the time provided. A trial respecting the above has been set as follows: All the address stuff.\nIf you cannot proceed to trial on the above scheduled date, you must attend in person at the Justice of the Peace counter no later than 7 business days prior to the trial date, to request an adjournment.\nShould you fail to appear on the above day, you may be convicted in absence and liable for any fine that the court orders and Late Payment Penalty charges may apply.\nClerk of the Court\nAlthough I know that the correct response is the Notice of Mistake again, my lampoon take on the reply.\nDear Clerk of the Court\nThank you for such an expedient arrest of the Surety known as �you�. This most certainly is a Breach of Trust, amongst many other Criminal Code of CANADA offences�. And they pleaded not guilty? What arrogance! \nAs Beneficiary of the Trust in matter, I appreciate your notification of this arrest and am quite satisfied that you will continue the good work and prosecute this, �You�, person to the full extent your Statute Laws. I hope that you will keep updating me on this matter and provide me the name of this Trustee/Public Servant so as to take Civil Actions from my end as well. \nThe Beneficiary looks forward to receiving a certified cheque through the REGISTERED POST for the amount paid in fines within 7 business days after the court date of November 23, 2013.  GOD BLESS YOU <----(Please don�t ban me for this)",
