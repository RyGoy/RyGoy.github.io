   "message": "Yes, they have concerns for the kids and access workers' safety because we refuse to do counseling any more or do a Psych/Parental Capacity Assessment. Although I informed them that their access worker was falling asleep at the visits, was over 60 and had no cell phone. That didn't seem to bother them then. Since Oct. 30 of last year, when I told them that we weren't participating any more, we have been reduced to in office access, 1 hr twice a week and if for any reason they got cancelled on their part, Too bad. They don't make them up. The  crazy part is DCS told me that at the time the access worker wasn't required to carry a cell phone, wasn't part of their contract.",
