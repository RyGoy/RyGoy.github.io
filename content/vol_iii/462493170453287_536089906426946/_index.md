   "message": "This guy is starting to annoy me quite a bit now geez...what is wrong with him....thoughts? this a skype conversation from that Bondservant Edward James-Robin guy, owlmon1 on skype\n-----------------------------------------------\n[1:35:35 PM] owlmon1: Robert told me the whole story of what a vile and without conscious scammer fraudster Scott is and you give him free reign....I smell a big rat...you can either get gloriofied for promoting the truth or get raked over the coals for promoting a fraud...Which one do you wish to be remembered by on youtube?\n[1:40:00 PM] owlmon1: That is not a threat but a warning to you and those you and your forum r deceiving,  White forked tongue make up contract law with heap lies...Chief turn back on his tribe by  teaching helping and promoting whiteman lie...Big error for chief as chief get fooled by complex bull forked tongue lie lose face...people no trust chief as of truth on youtube...Which is more important to you Ego or wisdom???  We will see if you wear the name Chief with wisdom or deception....Wise chief no act like proud fool!!!\n[1:59:15 PM] Chief Rock [sino general]: i will ask him about it, i have never heard about the issue or what happend\n[2:00:09 PM] Chief Rock [sino general]: whatever happened had nothing to do with what i do, i just merely do what i can do to help who i can help with their issues as best as i can,\n[2:16:03 PM] Chief Rock [sino general]: well, it appears as a threat and that is how it is witnessed as , my people been doing contract law before white many came here, only lie and bs i see is the promotion of white man jesus and the bible that cause so many from my nation to be raped and killed and removed our language and culture, so for you to stand there and try to send off info about the bible is an insult to anyone who is native, contract law is a way for folks to do their best to remedy and situation in their lives  as long as they are aware of what is being done,\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI have yet witness what you do as having a remedy, i dont doubt i just havent witnessed anything but i have witnessed ppl i help with contract law and they either get zero balance or debt removed. Others have been let out of jail and others kept the courts at bay, but you stand there and try to tell me what i do is fraud with no evidence other than a bible that promotes slavery and with a history against my people who had land stolen under the name of god, even if those folks were wrong in the messgae in the bible the bible is written in english,  or at least what you presss upon and use, however the real language it was truly written in, has been misinterpreted and who knows if  they ever will do it right. All i know is, bible has some commerical value in it showing their games, mainly the King James version but i for one do not stand under or have faith in it in anyway shape or form, only faith i have is in my peoples way and our views on who our creator is as it has always been,\n[2:17:27 PM] Chief Rock [sino general]: So i dunno, do as you wish for whatever youtube videos you want but know by speaking my name in an ill manner online without any evidence or proof of your words other than a bible, shows me your dishonor and inablity to truly know who i am and speaking out your ass about someone you never met.\nRobert has never said anything to me about what you speak, so i will have to speak with Robert because from what i can tell, you sure do love your heresay and suck it up without ever having any first hand knowledge about anything or anyone, just go by what you hear, unless you witnessed it yourself, i am unsure i can truly place value in the words",
