   "message": "Theoretical exercise here, using the principle that questioning negates understanding:\n\n'The Sheriff handed it to me and when I checked the back page, I told him that this wasn't a true certified copy. His response was \"I say it is\".'\n\nResponses (to the sheriff): Are you claiming to be a party to this document, as I cannot see your name on it?\n\nBy what authority are you claiming that this is a true certified copy?\n\nWhat evidence do you have to support your claim that this is a true certified copy?\n\nAre you offering legal advice?  Are you qualified to be providing legal advice? Are you a licensed lawyer?\n\n...Am I on the right track with this line approach or am I just pissing in the wind?",
