   "message": "\"Black's law 4th edition\".\n\nSeriously. Fuck off with that shit. Black's 9th is the current one, and I have warned repeatedly about quoting from your grandparent's time. It is 2013. Use the stuff from this FUCKING CENTURY. I warned about this before, so your will feel a sharp tingling sensation, followed by...\n\nBANNED!\n\nThat said, there seems to be a concerted effort to MISS THE FUCKING POINT. You listen to me, and grasp this shit, or I simply ban you. No more wasting time on idiots who won't listen.\n\nTAMPERING VOIDS. PERIOD.\nVOIDING VOIDS. PERIOD.\n\nEND RESULT HERE IN FUCKING REALITY = VOID.\n\nIf they say it's ILLEGAL, who do they charge? The LEGAL NAME?  ...well maybe, as long as that LEGAL NAME ISN'T ON THE ALLEGEDLY TAMPERED DOCUMENT. IT\"S NOT ILLEGAL FOR A NAMED PARTY TO VOID AND/OR AMEND ANY DOCUMENT WITH THEIR NAME ON IT. IT WILL ALWAYS STAND AS LEGALLY VOID.\n\nWATCH THE MECHANICS OF THE PROCESS! ONLY A PERSON CAN BE CHARGED WITH \"TAMPERING\", but THAT LEGAL PERSON HAS THE ENTITLEMENT (UNALIENABLE RIGHT) TO VOID ANYTHING WITH THEIR NAME ON IT!",
