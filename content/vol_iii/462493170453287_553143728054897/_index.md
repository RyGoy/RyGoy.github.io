   "message": "Here is what has been happening to me lately. I was in family court last Tuesday and Wednesday. On Tuesday after court started I told the justice that I didn't think that the court order was valid because I had voided it and I couldn't get a true certified copy of it. That I was told that the document was tampered. That when I looked up the word tampered it meant void. So the justice told me that there was (conveniently) a certified copy in the courtroom. The justice and the clerk hunted high and low and \"found\" a copy. The Sheriff handed it to me and when I checked the back page, I told him that this wasn't a true certified copy. His response was \"I say it is\". I also figured out another lie that the social worker made up and used in some of the documents to get the kid back. So my next step is to take it to the Attorney General?",
