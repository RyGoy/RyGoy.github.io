   "message": "In the United States (Depending on the state, as well, so check your region) Judges are elected, and so are the Public Prosecutors who ATTORN for their electoral DISTRICT (District ATTORNEY). That is the equivalent of \"the crown\" in the United States. Everyone In the US MUST BE ATTORNED, as everyone is SOVEREIGN there.\n\nIn the Commonwealth, there is ONE SOVEREIGN so SUBJECTS are ALREADY attorned. That's why the only ATTORNEYS work for the government. BARRISTERS AND SOLICITORS (Lawyers) practice law.\n\nPPSA is the same as a UCC FINANCING STATEMENT in the UNITED STATES.",
