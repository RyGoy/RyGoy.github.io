   "message": "I really don't know where I stand on this one...\n\nMy intuition tells me that provoking the bully is not a good idea. However, I may be willing to stand up to him, whereas most of his other victims may not be.(Not talking about violence here, just refusal to consent and support.)\n\nAnd while I admit that rather than provoking conflict, I could instead search for conflict already occurring, and come to the aid of those victims.....  the problem is that most of those other victims refuse the help.\n\nObviously we should still be offering it, but we can't force the help upon them. And if they refuse to be stood up for, and allow the bullies to insist that its all consensual... well the opportunity to stand up to that bully doesn't come.\n\nOr worse, it comes too late, when the bully has many bully followers, and victims, all willing to support his unlawful actions against those that don't consent.\n\nRight now I'm willing, and possibly able, to stand up to them. In the future, I may be willing, but no longer able.\n\nIts not an easy problem...",
