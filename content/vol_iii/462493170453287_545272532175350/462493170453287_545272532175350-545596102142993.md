   "message": "Hell, is having an abscess tooth in prison, after the dentist has quit, and having to wait a week, then getting into an argument with the new dentist about pulling it instead of saving it while your sitting in the chair, when its the last molar on that side of your jaw. I ended up saying \"Just give me some antibiotics and tylonol 3 and ILL SEE A REAL DENTIST WHEN I GET OUT IF YOU CANT DRILL IT!\" That got the guards called in, who threw me in the hole, for another week, with no antibiotics or pain killers.",
