   "message": "I went on a hunger strike there for thirty days after handing a lunch tray back to the orderly full of piss. They put me in a paper dress and threw me in an observation cell, and put me on food loaf. I refused to eat that shit. Instead I stop eating, and started filing administrative remedies. I forced that fucking jail to buy 100 thousand dollars worth of law books. The LT came to my cell drunk, crying about how difficult I had made it for everyone, who he couldnt afford to feed now cause I had to have a law library. LOL",
