   "message": "Something is forming in the mist in my head. Wouldn't it be Conspiacy, in their private ministerial or administrative capacity and outside immunity for judicial acts, for a court official, expected to know the law and barred from pleading good faith ignorance of the same, to deprive one of rights, by imposing a corperate classification without rights, upon a natural living man, woman or child? I need help. \nIve been trying to crack this code for 20 years. And I believe I have. What kind of crime is it to frame someone, from the jump, from the mail and wire fraud we all know it is?\n    THAT should an Attorney, or Judicial officer, together or separately, in their private ministerial capacity, in the administration of their public duties, \"conspire to deprive any person of rights,\" they most commonly succeed in such en-devours, by utilizing rules, regulations and statutes, known by them to be written and intended for fictional corporate entities or persons in commerce, misapplying and imposing these upon non fictional, unincorporated, living persons.\n    THAT any private citizen acting as Private Attorney General may bring suit against any public official under rico for crimes of mail and wire fruad, including deprivation and interference with constitutional life, liberty, and property rights. RICO allows average citizens (private attorneys general) to sue those organizations or government officials in their private capacity that commit mail and wire fraud as part of their criminal enterprise. To date, there are over 60 federal statutes that encourage private enforcement by allowing prevailing plaintiffs to collect attorney's fees. The object of civil RICO is thus not merely to compensate victims but to turn them into prosecutors dedicated to eliminating racketeering activity. 3 Id., at 187 (citing Malley-Duff, 483 U.S., at 151 ) (civil RICO specifically has a \"further purpose [of] encouraging potential private plaintiffs diligently to investigate\"). The provision for treble damages is accordingly justified by the expected benefit of suppressing racketeering activity, an object pursued the sooner the better. (Rotella v. Wood et al., 528 U.S. 549 (2000); Dasher v. Housing Authority of City of Atlanta, Ga., D.C.Ga., 64 F.R.D. 720, 722; See also Equal Access to Justice Act.\n\nWho's got the file on \"Notice of Error and Grace to opposing counsel to ammend defective pleading?\"",
