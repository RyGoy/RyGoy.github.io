   "message": "Ok Alexandre Boutet, If you have completed all of your obligations, the original note is your property isn't it?\n\nExample, You borrow 1000 from me, and agree to pay it back over time... I have you sign a promissory note when I loan you the money. After you've completed your end of the deal, You ask me for the original note back. I would give it to you. Done, the end.\n\nIn the case of a bank, the note gets sold. So they \"can't find it\" or whatever... But it is still your property and you want it back right? So if it was worth whatever the loan was originally, I would guess that it still is worth that. At least to you it is...\n\nSo, give them the bill for it.... :)\n\nI had a look the other day on the credit reporting website for the person I have, and there are LOTS of those notes out there that never got returned....\n\nIt looks like I have some letters to write.",
