   "message": "I did an administrative process on a credit company in regard to retrieval of the title/original promissory note/loan contract for a friend. They had paid off the loan but the credit company was trying to lay a Lot of bogus fees on at the end. So I simply informed them that to our knowledge the loan was discharged and the original title/note was to be returned in 10 days or a cheque to the same value. They dropped the extra charges (which was all my friend was concerned about) immediately and sent a clever colour photo copy of the loan contract with settled written by hand with a thick black board marker across it. I sent two more notices which completed the process with a default and consent to summary judgement. That has long since matured into a security for such a time as my friend feels confident enough to collect or sell it:)",
