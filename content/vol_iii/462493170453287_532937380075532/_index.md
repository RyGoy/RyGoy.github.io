   "message": "Solving a problem:\nSino is looking for discussion/feedback/knowledge or legitimate remedy on the following post. This SHOULD be easy, but Sack-of-shit lying paedophiles keep polluting the discussion with bullshit about \"God's Law\" and quoting from the very bible WE (the Nobility) made!\n\nSo I shall scrape the theist shit off my shoes, and carry it over here. Let's look at the answers.\n\nGOD and/or \"GOD'S WORD\" gets you banned. Period.\n\nSino posted:\n\nQuestion, how many got a loan(car,student,house etc..) and paid it off fully and received the original promissory note back ? If you did not get it back, that is theft and stolen property. So, now its time to request it back from the people who stole it or is trying to steal it. RCMP , Courts etc... should be called in to investigate. If they fail to provide you the original, they should in honor(not sure many corporations have, well i am sure 100% there is none lol) send you a chq for the full amount of the promissory note you tendered to them when you signed it. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRULES, ANY POSTS ABOUT RELIGION OR OUTSIDE OF SPEAKING ON SECURITIES OR CONTRACT LAW WILL BE REMOVED ONCE IM IN FRONT OF MY CPU, THIS IS NOT A PLACE OF TO ARGUE AND INSULT ONE ANOTHER, THE NEXT POST BY ANYONE WHO INSULTS OR ARGUES OUTSIDE THE FINE POINTS OF CONTRACT LAW WILL BE BANNED ALONG WITH YOUR COMMENTS FROM NOW ON. ONLY RELIGION POSTS THAT WILL BE TOLERATED ARE THAT OF POINTING OUT WHERE CONTRACT OR COMMERCIAL LAW IS BEING APPLIED. Thanks everyone :D",
