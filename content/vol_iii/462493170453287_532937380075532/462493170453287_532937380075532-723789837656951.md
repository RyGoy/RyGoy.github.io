   "message": "I was part of the chat last night.  It was awesome and informative.   I had an RBC MORTGAGE and transferred it to a credit union.  If I REQUIRE RBC to return my property is there any reason why it doesn't exist?  As stated above the credit union created a new mortgage is that correct? If this is the case I will be sending a registered letter REQUIRE that promissory note be returned",
