   "message": "Thanks. \nThe bank manager doesn't have a CLUE, so it's a waste of time dealing with her. \nAll people at BMO I've talked with, and Land Titles staff have told me there isn't such thing as a deed anymore, and it's done all electronically. Perhaps that's what they \"believe\"\nI payed Land titles for what I thought was a certified copy of my land title, and after not receiving that, by phone he told me his \"word\" was all the proof I needed, and sent me an email copy that's very vague on info.",
