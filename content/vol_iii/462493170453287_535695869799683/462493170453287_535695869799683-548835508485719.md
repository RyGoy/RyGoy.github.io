   "message": "The interesting part I noticed is how he suggests that the value of the lien needs to be in the range of 40-50 million to attract merchant banks to buy it at 1-2% of face value (and allow you to extract sufficient value for yourself)...\n\nAlso, he's very creative as to what can be done with the perfected lien/security...one he didn't mention is then placing it into your private trust as an asset for your company to borrow against...then surrender the lien in exchange for the loan.\n\nI like the concept of creative solutions for dealing with matters which removes the necessity of 'appealing to your rapist' for remedy :D",
