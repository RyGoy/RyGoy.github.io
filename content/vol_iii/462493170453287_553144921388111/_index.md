   "message": "As if that wasn't enough on Wednesday morning of last week, I got served with a summons to appear in court because my favorite Staff Sgt. of the RCMP is fearing and needs to get a peace bond. He stated that aggressive action, identifying myself as a member of an organization who target police and persons of authority for assault. He is fearing personal injury and damage to property. Does a peace bond run along the same lines as a normal criminal charge, being surety/accounting?",
