   "message": "In admiralty, once a claim is made you are presumed guilty (guilt (n.) \nOld English gylt \"crime, sin, fault, fine,\" of unknown origin, though some suspect a connection to Old English gieldan \"to pay for, debt\".) unless you can rebut the claim.\n\nThe system is trained to provoke you to react, thereby getting you to take a position. Then they say prove it. Who ever ends up with the burden of proof generally loses. Thus all cases are won solely by one party indicting themselves via there words or actions/consent.\n\nThis basic principal therefore gives birth to many possible remedy methods that are only limited by ones creativity and willing resolve.\n\nWithout getting too caught up in where does it say this and that and the minutiae, remember its a fictional system and our foundation should be the basic premise of the game, namely contract (offer/counter offer). \n\nThe moment we lose sight of that basic element one can get lost and end up bamboozled by legalize, and ultimately capitulating /consenting in one way or another.\n\nSo wether it's discharging or setting off a debt with stamp, void, endorsement, ect...it's all just a counter offer...and that game can go on and on until someone consents via word or conduct. \n\nAlways reverse proof of claim, because in a fictional system can anyone prove anything?\n\nPeace.",
