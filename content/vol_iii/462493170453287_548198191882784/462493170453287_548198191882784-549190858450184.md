David,  i didn't ask the clerk to interpret them for me, i told him put them on the record because they are relevant facts to the case, they may do as they like but with my stuff on the record... theres a problem with their books, things no longer add up, this transaction is not complete.lol so improper in that regard only :p my returning it signed with incidentals means they have payment but also the liability for the mess. 2 wet sigs & a trustee...... hahaha",
