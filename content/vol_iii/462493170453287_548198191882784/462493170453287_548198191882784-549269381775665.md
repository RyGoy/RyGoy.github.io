   "message": "i had no contract/dealings ever with Dept of social welfare, i was in a building i had a lease for, perjury was commited claiming i was \"working\" there for someone else when i had implied no commerce, nobody would indentify themselves, my breach of peace was insisting on i.d. i was shown a .38 when i asked for i.d. i responded \"his pissy little 38 didn't impress me i'd had bigger\" ego's were bruised. criminal damage was relieving myself outside my trousers rather than piss myself, which i alerted the garda to & offered to clean up if he got me a mop :p",
