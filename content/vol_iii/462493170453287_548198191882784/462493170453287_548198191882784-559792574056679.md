   "message": "Silence can be a powerful responce ;) I think the point is i'm too far along to be pulling on Scotts shirt tails so i'm sorry for that.  it boils down to my conviction not to allow anyone interfere, confuse or ignore my facts. I appreciate the comments butt CC'ing at this point would be somewhat pleading with my rapist, i'm getting the surety's fuckin name & thats that. new responce will be sent in the same fashion as last, its up to them. if they want to test my conviction, i'll give them a lesson in it. cheers again (Y)",
