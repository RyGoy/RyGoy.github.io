   "message": "A FRN states \"This Note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.' Does that mean one can use it in a public capacity tendering a public law OR one can use it in a private capacity tendering a private law?  \n\nAlso, in 1971, the Treasury department discontinued the United States Note, which was considered lawful money pursuant to the Legal Tender Act of 1862, and stated that \"The FRN serves every purpose the USN did and there is no demand for the USN\".  I take this to mean that the FRN can be used as LAWFUL MONEY (in a private capacity).  I actually have an on going conversation with the Federal Reserve at the moment.....care to add anything.....?",
