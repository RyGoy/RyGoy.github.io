   "message": "The video is very good. Thanks. I have a question about legal tender: You said \"You are BOUND by ACTS, STATUTES, and CODES when you use MONEY....\". Do you mean that using money can make you an inadvertant party to a [tendered] contract? And if almost nobody (eg. me) 'gets it', couldn't one argue that the contract is invalid due to lack of full disclosure or something along those lines?",
