The understanding one has now of money is far more comprehensive, The protection of the notice of mistake, the ability to deal with forces that have kicked my ass, most of my life, were taught to me here.\nThe mindfuck I have had recently wasn't as bad as I thought, just had to use it, had to jog the memory... \nMy conversations, a while ago, with the Admiral had me reevaluate everything and showed me I was still  valuing the wrong things.  So if I have gone thru this... then I know at least 1 other person may have or will, as well.\nI think of it as part of the cargo of this forum it is important to add value. \nThe value of a common experience and that the hard part is done...  as was pointed out, as well as the fact, \nI have already paid dearly for it. \nIt is fascinating to me. Empowering. \n\"The Tender For Law\" is the hole in the fence.",
