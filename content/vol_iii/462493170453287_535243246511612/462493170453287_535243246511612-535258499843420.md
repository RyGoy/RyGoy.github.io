   "message": "I remember some time ago Canada was offering originals (I'm not exactly sure of the amount) about $27,000.00 to leave the reserve and to lose all rights afforded to them by treaties. Essentially a bribe to turn their backs on their own people. Many originals took the bribe...bought cars or trucks, stereos, a new wardrobe etc. The vehicles have since aged and rusted, the stereos quickly became outdated, and the clothes became worn and threadbare. Now many are poor once again, yet, can never return to their \"home\" or reservation. Is this bribe still being offered?",
