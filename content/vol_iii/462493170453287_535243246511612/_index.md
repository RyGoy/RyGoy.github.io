   "message": "CHIEFROCK SINO GENERAL - So, first off, Number\n\n1. There is no FIRST NATIONS period, its a made up name created by the INDIAN AFFAIRS, so using it is taking a benefit of their product thereby placing YOU UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION and agreeing to their laws.\n\n2. CANADA IS A CORPORATION which has absolutely no rights under any treaty as from what i can gather or understand, Canada did not sign treaties the KING reps and QUEENS reps did, Canada seems to think they can step in as benefactors to this these old treaties.\nNumber\n\n3. First nations never violated the treaties ???????OMFG ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW !!!!!!\n\nOK, get this thru your head, registering to be a Canadian is a direct violation and removes you out of any treaty period.\n\nHOLDING ANYTHING THAT IS PROPERTY OF CANADA OR A PROVINCE WHICH IS REGISTERED to Canada, means you are now saying A BIG FUCK YOU to your nation you are from and wishing to be part of the settlers new corporation as their employee to help press on the bull shit SCAM that is running at this moment,\n\nDO REALIZE canada OWES ALL THE NATIONS OVER 999 TRILLION IN GOLD, SILVER AND OTHER RESOURCES THEY KEEP ON STEALING AND USING TO DO BUSINESS ON OUR LANDS.\n\nHappy Canada Day? Learning about Treaties in tar sands territory\n\nEmma Pullman is writing stories from impacted communities on the front lines of the tar sands in the lead up to the 4th Annual Healing Walk, a spiritual gathering and 14 km walk to pray for the healing of the land and people at the front lines of tar sands expansion. The Healing Walk is July 5-6, 2013 in Fort McMurray, Alberta.\n\nWhile many Canadians are celebrating the 146th anniversary of this country, I don�t much feel like celebrating today. Right now, I am at the Beaver Lake Cree Nation, a community whose traditional territory is on both the Athabasca and Cold Lake tar sands projects.\n\nIt�s hard to take part in the festivities when you understand the colonialism, genocide, theft of land and resources and broken treaties that are part of the history of this country.\n\nAthabasca Chipewyan First Nation activist and educator Susana Deranger wrote in Briarpatch magazine:\n\n    �This Canada Day, I reach out to you all and appeal to your consciousness and ask you to reflect on what you are celebrating. I ask you to reflect on what this day means to Indigenous Peoples on the territory you are living on that has given you so much.\n\n    \"I ask you to dig deep inside of yourself and think about how we can work together to rectify the colonial legacy of Canada. I ask you to walk with me and others to truly create a place that is worth celebrating. I ask you to stand up to create a Canada that acknowledges the wrongs of yesterday and today, and paves the way for dignity and respect for all peoples tomorrow and all the tomorrows that follow.�\n\nMy own reflection of her words has led me to think about treaty rights, and how few Canadians understand the treaties or what it means to be Treaty Peoples. So today, I sat down with Tantoo Cardinal, Crystal Lameman, Maria Laboucan-Massimo and Melina Laboucan-Massimo, all members of Treaty 6 and Treaty 8 territory. And I did what feels like the most patriotic thing I�ve ever done on Canada Day -- I learned about Treaty 6 and Treaty 8, the treaties of the lands most impacted by the tar sands.\n\n10 THINGS CANADIANS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE TREATIES UPON WHICH THE TAR SANDS ARE BEING DEVELOPED\n\n1.  If you are a Canadian, know you are a signatory to a Treaty. If you are a settler (i.e. non-Indigenous), know you are a benefactor of the Treaty. \n\n2.   Read the Treaty.\nKnow which Treaty territory you are on.\nYou can read Treaty 6 and Treaty 8, the two treaty territories that sit in the tar sands. \n\n3.  Know that the Treaty its not just an Indigenous peoples agreement.\nWe are all Treaty peoples.\nKnow that treaties are the foundation of Canada. \n\n4.  The Treaty is a reciprocal treaty, an equal treaty for co-existence.\nIt was an agreement between the British Crown and Indigenous peoples.\nFirst Nations leaders believed they were entering into a trust relationship with the representative of the British Crown.\nThey considered the Treaty a mutual trust agreement to live in peace.\n\n5.  Non-native people are benefactors of those treaties because they are receiving the benefits and profits of the resources from native land.\nThere are billions of dollars coming out of traditional territories, and it never stays in the territory.\nThese real costs of resource extraction, in turn, are borne by the people and communities who have lived here all along. \n\n6.  First Nations never violated the treaty.\n\n7.  First Nations have never surrendered their land. \n\n8.  The federal government has a fiduciary responsibility with First Nations who entered into Treaty.\nIn plain terms, it's similar to the responsibility that a corporation has to its shareholders.\nThe Canadian government�s shareholders are First Nations and it has a duty, a legal responsibility to them. \n\n9.  When reading the Treaty, you�ll never come across the word �ownership�, because no one can own the land.\nThe land owns its inhabitants. \n\n10.  According to the Treaty, as long as the grass grows, the rivers flow and the sun shines, First Nations will always have a right to the land to hunt and fish and forage.\nAs long as industrial development continues to take place on these lands without consent, these Constitutional rights are being violated.\n\n�It says in the Treaty that we will SHARE THIS LAND WITH YOU TO THE DEPTH OF A PLOUGH,� Crystal said to me. \n\nSenator Allan Bird, Montreal Lake Cree Nation, is directly quoted on Treaty 6: �the government said that we would live together, that I am not here to take away what you have now�I AM HERE TO BORROW THE LAND�TO THE DEPTH OF A PLOUGH�that is how much I want.�\n\nThat�s why ACCORDING TO TREATY LAW, ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THE GROUND THAT CREATES REVENUE BELONGS TO FIRST NATIONS.\n\nCrystal adds, �AS PER THE TREATY, ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THE TERRITORY is supposed to go to those people. The federal government has a fiduciary responsibility with the First Nations who entered into Treaty.�\n\nBut for Maria Laboucan-Massimo, THE LUBICON TERRITORY WHERE SHE IS FROM HAS SEEN $14 BILLION IN RESOURCE DOLLARS LEAVE HER TERRITORY.\nThat money goes to federal government, and into a kind of bank.\nWhile the rest of the country uses this money, HER COMMUNITY DOESN�T SEE MUCH OF IT.\n\n",
