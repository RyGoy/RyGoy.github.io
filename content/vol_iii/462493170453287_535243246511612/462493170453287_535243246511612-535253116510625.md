   "message": "I was born on this land. I am none of those words. I have the right to use the lands for my living as long as I do not encroach on what some one else is using and not abandoned. The land I plough, the creatures I capture for food and/or other uses, the ground what I can make of it for my use, the rivers and/or lakes that I use for travel, fishing and/or fresh water to drink, clean and other necessities of life and/or the growth that grows on the land for my use in order to fashion shelter, produce heat and/or other uses for my use.\nI have the right of all this. To deny me these rights because of a piece of paper with words is tantamount to being born into slavery.",
