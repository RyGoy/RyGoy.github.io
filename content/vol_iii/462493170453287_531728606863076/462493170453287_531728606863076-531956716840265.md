   "message": "I know you do, so how exactly do you survive? What do you do for a living? I sell information every day! I wouldn't be able to survive without selling my skills and 'information' to people that need articles written, graphic design work, or web design work. How about charging money for services? Products? Where should I draw the line? Shouldn't people be free to barter? I don't make anyone buy anything, and if they buy it, maybe it will have more value to them.",
