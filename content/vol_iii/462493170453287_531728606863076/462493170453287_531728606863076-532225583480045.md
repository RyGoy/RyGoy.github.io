   "message": "I just showed you how to survive without Fiat currency. Create a person. That person acts as currency exchange.\n\nYOU only accept currency that is NOT fiat currency. If people want your servies/value, they have to BUY YOUR CURRENCY.\n\nThe  reason YOU can't do that was mentioned earlier. YOU HAVE NO VALUE.\n\nInformation is NOT a commodity, it's a right. Selling information is fraud. Your \"time\" is NOT valuable in commerce. It just isn't, because you have nothing that anyone wants. That's why what I showed you went over your head.",
