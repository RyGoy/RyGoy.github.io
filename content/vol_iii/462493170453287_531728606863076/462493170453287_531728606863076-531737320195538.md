   "message": "I'm just warming up, Trent! :D\n\nIt's going to take a bit of social-engineering, and a LOT of teaching, but I am building something HUGE. \n\nWhen thetenderforlaw.com is up, then I will start showing you how to secure your freedom with technology. Not only that, I will show you all, step-by-step, how to do EXACTLY the same thing. All the government stooges can do is tremble in impotent fury, while we construct beyond their understanding.\n\nI'm waiting for a declaration of \"crazy\" from the government, so I am free to disclose EVERYTHING... including the very contract that bound me to keep my mouth shut. :D\n\nSo, I'm glad you appreciate it, and am overjoyed that you are actually USING it in its proper manner. :D\n\nIt's not an ego-boost, it's reassurance that I'm not wasting my most precious asset; My time.",
