   "message": "Pardon me for \"Stereotyping\" but you really do exhibit the mentality of the Free-Dumb Movement. \"Of the Family\" is the first indicator. Dump that shit.\n\nCan you use it in the UK? Exactly who's permission are you seeking?\n\nYour kind are always seeking \"magic\" documents, and never actually READ WHAT THE FUCKING THING SAYS.\n\nNotice of mistake is to detach yourself from names derived from Public Documents. It is your right to declare it, and NOT their right to refuse.\n\nYOU decide what documents can be used where. Not me. Not the UK government. YOU.\n\nREAD THE DOCUMENT and figure out its intent. It's written in the Queen's English, so you can't claim it's written in a language you don't understand! NOTICE OF MISTAKE isn't written in Yiddish, and has no magic powers.\n\nJust remember. There are no \"Stupid Questions\". Just inquisitive idiots... :P\n\nDump the Free-Dumb shit. Seriously.",
