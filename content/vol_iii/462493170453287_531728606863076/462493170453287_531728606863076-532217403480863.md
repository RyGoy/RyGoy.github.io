So I only accept MY currency.\n\nI think you miss the EXCHANGE part if it... and don't EVER imply that I charge money for information again.\n\nEVER.\n\nIf you need communications networks, Enterprise networks, or just need a computer to do shit for you... That's what I do. Above all I am a COMPUTER SCIENTIST. That has value. You must pay for it in the currency I DECIDE. Don't like it, hire my *cough* Competition.\n\n...but I don't \"sell\" knowledge. As you can see, I don't even tolerate the vague inference that I may do such a thing.",
