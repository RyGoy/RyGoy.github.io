   "message": "That would mean you are subscribed to the group.\n\nHave you read the \"pinned\" post in the group?\n\nI NEVER \"invite\" people here. They enter of their own free will. The fact that you ask premature questions, means your critical thinking faculties are limited too.\n\nThere is a big \"Lurker Purge\" coming up. Try not to be in it. Start actually READING the group. \n\nIt's a mess at the moment... I grant that. But it won't exist in its current form much longer. The keys will be tossed to Derek Moran, and he can circle-jerk with the group over \"clubhouse rules\".\n\nIn the meantime, everything you are currently capable of grasping, is in this group SOMEWHERE.\n\nYou might want to ditch the \"of the family\" thing, too. I target those every time I see them, and give the bearer of \"of the family\" all the contempt the Free-Dumb movement deserves.",
