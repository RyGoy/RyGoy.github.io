   "message": "The way I am starting to see it, it's not merely as simple as \"the PERSON\" in our wallet, as Pete says. The BC is a SECURITY INTEREST (as Scott said) and nothing more. I also recall Scott saying that each new account is a NEW PERSON. I get from that, it is an oversimplification, perhaps even simplified to the point of error, or to a point approaching error; to say we have a PERSON in our wallet. We have a SECURITY INTEREST in our wallet. We (and others) can create a NEW PERSON (ACCOUNT) when we/they wish to use the name on the SECURITY INSTRUMENT. There may, in fact, be tens of thousands of PERSONS (not just a single person in our wallet) existing in an equal number of ACCOUNTS, many of which are not likely to be anywhere near our wallet. Following this logic, we might be very well served not to think of all this ACCOUNTING, and all these ACCOUNTS as only addressing \"the PERSON in my wallet\", when each account is in fact a NEW PERSON. :) What do you think of this Scott Duncan?",
