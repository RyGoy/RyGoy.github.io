   "message": "Scott Duncan \nI just spoke with �my� MP�s office. They wanted me to send them something in writing and am about to email his OFFICE as his OFFICE REQUESTED. I�d love your suggestions for questions, and, or, perhaps points to be raised.\n\nThe kid I spoke with became obviously nervous after a few questions and suddenly had a meeting after initially confirming he had some time to address �a number of questions�. (Just me having some initial fun.) I'm starting to think a bit more like a cat. I see more and more people willing to act like diseased rodents on my ship. \n\nOf course, the OBVIOUS QUESTION first:\n\n1. What does �THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER� mean?\n\nAnd then perhaps:\n\n2. Who is the surety for the name on the Birth Certificate?\n3. Am I the HOLDER of the Birth Certificate, or the HOLDER IN DUE COURSE?\n4. Should I use the Birth Certificate for IDENTIFICATION?\n5. ?\n6. ?\n\nPerhaps I should get Happyface Sid to send it as a homework assignment? Lol \n\nAgain, I�d love your insight as well as anyone else�s good ideas.",
