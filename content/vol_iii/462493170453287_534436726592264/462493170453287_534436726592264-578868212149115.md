   "message": "Sounds like more belief based on shit you pulled directly out of your ass, as we all just witnessed. The fact is, MOST of the posts  I make are made without \"hollering for somebody to tell\" me I'm right (easy to check). I'm starting to stop laughing though, as your BELIEFS and the SHIT you pull out of your ass (with no basis in fact and with total abandon for the hard and fast rules here at TTFL against BELIEF and PULLING SHIT OUT OF YOUR ASS) is starting to become a tiresome joke. :(",
