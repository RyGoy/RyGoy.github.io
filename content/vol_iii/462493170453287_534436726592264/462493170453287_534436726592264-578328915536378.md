   "message": "From my understanding, WE all may be better served if we provide a Notice for DISCHARGE as opposed to setoff.  I recall Winston Shrout stating he thought DISCHARGE is preferable because the debt is \"written off\", as opposed to being settled some time in the future. SETOFF retains the debt on the books, indicating it will be dealt with in the FUTURE, while DISCHARGE gets the debt off the books, which serves us all. <-- I hope this isn't a shit stain! :)",
