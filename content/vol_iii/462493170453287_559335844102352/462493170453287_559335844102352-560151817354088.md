   "message": "Pete Daoust - you are being offered a controversy, plain and simple. If it were I, I may consider  completing the administrative process with a counter offer to their controversy. \n\nLike; Your offer of adjudication is conditionally accepted upon proof of claim that, 1) the account is not already discharged by your acceptance of my tender, 2) did bank of Canada officially dishonor my instrument, 3) did bank of Canada officially deny discharge and 3) is there a notice of defect in the instrument?  \n\nPlease provide either one or all of the appropriate evidences in affidavit form under penalty of perjury within 10 days so other arrangements can be made or it will be agreed between the parties that the matter is hereby setoff, settled and closed.\n\nThen a notice of default / foreign summary judgement.\n\nJust an option, at least then when your taken to court you have a record of a complete process of discharge, offer to cure and default to hang onto in aid of denying any judge the right to subject matter jurisdiction - while they verbally push and pull at you to take their offer and reality.\n\nI myself am facing the exact same situation on behalf of someone else I'm helping at the moment.\n\nI did a proof of claim request instead of a discharge this time, asking for the speed camera model and make, the calibration reports, the officers operation certificate and affidavit, affidavit of injured party and or witnesses, evidence of damages, ect...they of course defaulted and my friend got summoned. So I will do a show cause order, including an affidavit of negative averment from the defendant, and then tell the court; i will be simply conditionally attending the hearing for the exclusive purpose of being showed cause why the hearing should not be dismissed in accordance with the private agreement of discharge via default between the parties evidence by an administrative process via third party presenter registered post?\n\nThen I will attempt to hold that claim calmly amidst their verbal court room assaults:-) Peace.",
