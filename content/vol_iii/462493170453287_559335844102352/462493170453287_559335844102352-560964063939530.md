   "message": "What about notarial protest via a JP. Go to the JPs office and explain a peace officer threatened you to accept the ticket. Tell the JP you accepted the ticket under duress for fear of violence when exercising your right not to contract. Tell the JP the the officer in question was belligerent and had no concept of your right not to accept his offer. I've been meaning to do this but I never get tickets. Is this a valid process?",
