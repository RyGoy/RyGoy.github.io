   "message": "I'm putting together a draft Affidavit of Understanding, for a few reasons, first to do an inventory for myself and second to forward with the acceptance for my dental bill. I would appreciate any feedback.(additions, deletions, clairifications)  I borrowed the first paragraph from an affidavit I read of Scott Duncan. The purpose of creating an affidavit is to attach it to the signed bill the dentist will be sending to the Bank of Canada, or should it be sent separately by me?\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF GAIL BLACKMAN\n\nI, GAIL BLACKMAN, also known as Gail Blackman, also known as Gail BLACKMAN, also known as BLACKMAN, Gail being a loyal subject of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the House of Windsor, and being a beneficiary of the Commonwealth, and assuming full civil and commercial liability, and standing in SUI JURIS status, and having authority in these matters stand on Her Majesty's honour, and MAKE OATH AND SAY:\n\n1.  The Birth Certificate of GAIL BLACKMAN is a SECURITY INSTRUMENT and confirmation of a share of the EQUITY derived from the resources of the Governmental Jurisdiction within which the Birth Certificate is located.\n\n2. It is illegal to \"pay\" a bill in Canada and I do not wish to create more debt by using debt to pay debit. cite: Supreme Court 1978 Bank of Canada v. Bank of Montreal:\n\nï¿½As I have already noted, a promissory note, by definition, involves an unconditional promise to pay a sum certain in money, but it is not itself money. True, the obligation of a promissory note may be carried forward by a renewal note, but no matter how many renewals there be, or how many replacements under different terms, there is no liquidation of the debt until it is DISCHARGED...\" [Page 1156]\n\n3. I act in good faith, and in a NON-adverse manner, as I have no wish to create controversy. I wish to remain in peace-and-honour.\n\n4. The Birth Certificate is proof of the security of my person named GAIL BLACKMAN, to which Gail Blackman is the Beneficiary.\n\n5. The Bank of Canada is owned by the people.\n\n6. The Bank of Canada is the only organization in Canada that is capable of creating money/credit from the shareholders/peoples valuable consideration and/or signature.\n\n7. In accordance with the Bills of Exchange Act RSC 1985, 16. (1) A bill of exchange is an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay, on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person or to bearer.",
