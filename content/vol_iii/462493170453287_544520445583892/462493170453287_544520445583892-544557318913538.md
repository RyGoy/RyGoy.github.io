I have no obligation to assist you in your duty to collect my dignity and worth, energy and the fruits of my labor in support of your War Crimes, First Nations Genocide, Criminal Breach of Trust, Criminal Extortion and the willful breach in your binding obligation to International Human Rights Law. You ANDREW TREUSCH, are part and party to the crimes claimed above, I claim your willful participation is for the purpose of personal gain derived from public monies without regard to the shared principles of mutual benefit.\n\nI am bound to my conscience, not the will of others. My duty is to the men, women and children within the Common Law Jurisdiction of Canada.",
