   "message": "OK, David. Pay attention:\n\n1:That's the last time you post \"your definition\" of ANYTHING. \"Your definition\" is a shit-stain on reality. I ban people for that.\n\n2: If you are in commerce, you accept a TENDER FOR LAW. Learn what that means. You DON'T know more than me. You just don't. That's not \"arrogance\" or \"ego\". It's just a fact. Such accusations also get you banned, because they are UNTRUE.\n\n3: NO imaginary friends. No Yaweh. No Jehova. No Jesus. No \"Spirits\". Attempting to introduce ANY of that stupidity will get you banned.\n\nYou are all caught up with the rules. As for who I am? I'm tired of typing it. Stop typing and start reading. These questions have been asked and answered.",
