   "message": "Need advise.\nI bought my house in 2007 and signed a contract with the building company and in this contract it had a section that a management company would take over the servicing of the estate I live in.\nWhat I need to understand is, the Building Contractor has gone out of business and there is no bilateral contract between myself and the management company, so can the contract still stand against me with regards to the management company?\nDonï¿½t kick me out for this one Scott",
