   "message": "Scott Duncan It's all Accounting and Surety. These are just what lead to the current system. The goal is to remove MONEY from them.\n\nSwearing an affidavit, acknowledges THEIR \"Authority\", no matter how true the content may be. You are seeing what is TRUE, but you focus on the wrong things.\n\nI've demonstrated Cryptographic Currencies WORK. I'm building a SCALABLE, GLOBAL currency.\n\nI'm just going to starve them. My money is simply BETTER. Once deployed it will be out of my hands (Or anyone's for that matter) and MONEY'S FUNCTION will be separated from the TENDER FOR LAW, thus rendering your whole post moot.\n\nThis is one of the MANY things I am doing with MY life...\n\n...what the fuck have YOU done lately?\n\nCrying to strangers that you have a \"status\", is simply begging for the wrong kind of attention, from people who see your declaration as an invitation to ENFORCE.\n\nThese are the clubhouse rules of a club that YOU AREN'T IN. Stop wasting your life on it. Read more of this forum. I'm showing you the PROPER way to extract yourself and not starve.",
