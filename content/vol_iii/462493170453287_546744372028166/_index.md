   "message": "I have a couple of stupid/crazy questions. Is a court order not a contract? If one doesn't adhere to the order but the other party (cps) still keeps it going, then the contract is valid? But if both sides don't adhere to it, does it not make it null and void on that basis alone? For example CPS wants us to take a Parental Capacity Assessment and Psychological evaluation, we said no and that is why they pulled in the reins on our supervised access from being in the home to in their office for only two hours a week. But since this little situation with the kid having left foster care, and being returned, now they have decided that we get no visitation till the next court date at least ( and they are then looking to have the kids put into permanent care). So now they have broken their order by not allowing visitation, or getting that in judge approved to stop all visits for now. Or am I totally out to flipping lunch here?",
