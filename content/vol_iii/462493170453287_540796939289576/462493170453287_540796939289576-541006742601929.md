   "message": "IT WORKS!\nGET OUT JAIL FREE CARD\nFOR ANY ONE ORDERED TO PAY\nWHAT THEY CANNOT \n\nQUESTION TO JUDGE, ATTORNEY, BANKER, OR TAX COLLECTOR \nI can make no Payment until the form of payment is clarified and defined, considering the following facts : \n FACT ONE : No state may make any thing but gold or silver coin tender in payment of debts (Article 1 sec 10, US Constitution), yet no payment in gold or silver may be demanded in payment of any debt or obligation ( HJR 192). \n\nFACT TWO :  Neither paper currency nor deposits have value as commodities, as deposits are merely book entries, and it is still a felony to tender these or any such substitute electronically for lawful money in many States.  �Checks, drafts, money orders & bank notes are not lawful money of the United States\". State v. Mellon, 73 Pac. 321, 43 Ore. 168. \n\nFACT THREE  \"The legal tender quality of paper money is only valuable for the purposes of dishonesty. (Knox v. Lee (1871)\" and By agreeing to engage in commerce, between you and the government, or by being tricked into paying any debt or obligation in anything other than gold or silver, one would be conspiring to 'counterfeit' and engaging in a crime with criminals, and so must respectfully decline and resist any pressure to accept any offer and reject any attempt to be drawn into contributing, weather directly or indirectly, to any manner of criminality as defined by law such as forgery and counterfeiting value, or sacrificing any energy to any false idol, worshiped or demanded from you by any man, judge, or leader among men who worships such false idols, in any city, court room, or capitol one may be standing in. You do not owe a false god or its worshipers participation in any worship, rituals, or sacrifices, nor must you be the sacrifice of one of his worshipers. \n\n�No person shall ever be imprisoned for debt.� - The 1876 Constitution of the State of Texas Art. 1 � 18. �No man can give that which he has not.� Jackson v. Bradford, 4 Wend. (N.Y.) 619. \n\nTHAT FACTUALLY \n Legalese, legality, and Legalism,  the science practiced by attorneys at law in private for profit commercial courts, which by law cannot be public institutions, thus masquerading as such illegitimately, as apposed to being in the Law common to nature and sense, are by most religions taught to be engaging in simple, black magic, witchcraft,  and sophistry, or double speak, originating with the father of deceit. The attorneys, standing around you are themselves deceived, deceivers, deceiving others, and you know it. Everything around you is insolvent and has been foreclosed on. The lawyers, judges and police, sadly, are like Japanese soldiers on some forgotten island unaware that they have been beaten and surrendered. \n They just haven�t gotten the memo yet. Its up to You to deliver it and stand up for your natural liberty rights and freedoms.",
