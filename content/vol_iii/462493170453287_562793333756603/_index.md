   "message": "Hello's...\n\nI've been receiving some private FB messages recently, from others asking \"ME\" questions.....I am a little confused when this happens, since I don't think I am the most intelligent guy in this group, it makes me think that I may answer you with bullshit :D\n\nSo I will post these questions I receive here, in TTFL, and will try to answer the best I can, so others can detect my bullshit, if bullshit there is....\n\nQuestion From Philip Laforet:\n\nHey Pete, how ya doing? None of your business :D\n\n I was wondering how your knowledge was on doing liens. I am not certain on the method in regards to sending invoices and statements. Also how do you collect on them, I guess if they don't pay once they get the lien, I would have to go into superior court? if you are not sure, do you know who is best at it? Thanks!\n\nWell, the best method to send invoices is with registered mail Canada Post.\n\nSame thing with statements.\nSame thing with Notice\nSame thing with Final Notice (because I am a nice guy :D )\nSame thing with Default Notice.\n\nYou do NOT collect on them, you register a PRIVILLEGE LEGAL on their stuff, if ever they decide to SELL this thing, you are in line, maybe the first, second or..???....to get paid out of that sale.\n\nNo superior court involve in that process.\n\nThe best at it that I know, so far, would be Scott Duncan.\n\nYou are welcome.\n\nYou've been in business Philip Laforet, what would you do if one of your customer would not pay you ?......same thing here, it's STRICTELY BUSINESS....\n\nThanks\nPete Daoust.",
