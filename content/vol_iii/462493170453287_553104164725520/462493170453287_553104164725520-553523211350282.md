   "message": "The only reason I post this here is to show everyone I have the balls to stand up to these douche bags. No fucks were given other than my courtesy to the courtesans of public service. Sadly the people's peas garden fucked themselves by not following through with the 3 step process. I no longer assist activists, for the most part they live in fear and will not truly challenge de facto authority. Activists want to do the right thing, they just don't want to do the process. I have only a small piece of the puzzle, I'm here because the principles of correspondence and mentalism lead me here. I do my home work, I see the value of Scott Duncan and his gift to us to share so that we may correct the wrongs by courtesy of lien. I've a long way to go in understanding trust law and commerce. What I do know is that I will not stop, I will exercise my will and find the proper way to have my equity flow into the trust. I have made many mistakes but I stand before you all with the intent to follow through and share every mistake and success.",
