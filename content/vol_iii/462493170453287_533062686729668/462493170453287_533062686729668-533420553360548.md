   "message": "I know that I have been told that you are a genius Scott, but why when I look at your comment it is something idiotic. The previous comment I saw from you was something like... \"YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOUR SIN # TO HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT AND ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS AN IDIOT\". Well guess what. I have a bank account and I didn't give my social security number. You were wrong on that and you are wrong now. The \"British Columbia Provincial Coat of Arms\" on the document is irrelevant. I am the one that will slam dunk this case. I would like you to come down to the New Westminster Provincial Court on July 17th. Watch me educate the whole courtroom.",
