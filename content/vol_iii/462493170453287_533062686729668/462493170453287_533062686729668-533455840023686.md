   "message": "Oh fuck. The stupid little douche is a Free-Dumb nut.\n\nOn his page he says \"So technically The Crown corporation minions are Patent Trolls coming after me for having the \"British Columbia Provincial Coat of Arms\" on my Peace Officer document. I never claimed to be a Peace Officer under any Acts, Statutes or Bylaws. I am not a trustee of The Crown limited liability corporation operating for profit. City Of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada are limited liability corporations operating for profit and are subdivisions of The Crown corporation. I was okay with the corporate logo because it is commonly known for identifying the landmass. My purpose is not to meet a quota to serve the aristocracy, but to keep the peace and preserve our liberties.\"\n\nHe's ONE of them.\n\nOK, FIRST, the stupid Free-Dumb Fuckwit doesn't know what a PATENT is. This a COPYRIGHT issue, not a patent issue.\n\nYou would do well to ignore this fuckwit.",
