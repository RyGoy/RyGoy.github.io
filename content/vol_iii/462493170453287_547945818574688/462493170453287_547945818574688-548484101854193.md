   "message": "I actually learnt a few things from Derek Hill, or at least from the learning around his experiences, re voiding orders & the Notice of Mistake (before he shot himself in the foot & felt the tingly sensation)...\n\nI also learnt a few things about myself...that I'm often naive & gullible & need to wake the fuck up & open my eyes, especially with sifting the facts from the bullshit...so thank you Scott Duncan and indirectly D Hill for the mp3 analysis on separating the wheat from the chaff.\n\nAnd to the administrator & the rooster...you both offer significant value in here, in your own unique ways, so to your current lovers' tiff, I dedicate the following...enjoy :D  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBMYow46LxQ",
