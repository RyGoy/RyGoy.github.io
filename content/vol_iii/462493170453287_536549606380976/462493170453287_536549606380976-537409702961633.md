   "message": "The source of my authority? Hmmm. Why am I KING? Am I KING? Me thinks I may or may not be. I may not be King because I have tendered for law in more places than I care to admit (think 80 year old hooker valuing the wrong things), and, or, I can still and always be KING if I can back up my \"%*&%*&$$\" claims with PROPER procedure and AN ABSENCE OF SHIT STAINS? I wonder if I need to be removed from the PUBLIC first in order to be KING. How can a King be one of the public? I'm guessing a King can only be among the public, but never one of them.
