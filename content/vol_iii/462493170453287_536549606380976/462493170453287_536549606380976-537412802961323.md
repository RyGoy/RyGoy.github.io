   "message": "well... you create a corporation,  set up a trust with the corporation as the trustee of the trust ( which should be a written document.. nothing to complicated it can be fairly simple... ) of which you are first director and sole beneficiary, you then lien the ALL CAPS name thru the corporation  name and all accounts associated with it... Isolating yourself in admiralty law.  \n\nThe corporation is considered a person by law but is only answerable to its share holders of which once again you are the sole shareholder and director... YOU are then KING of your trust... and get an accountant to mange the books, give public notice= bill of exchange... read the bill of exchange book posted here somewhere\n\nhowever knowing what words actually mean and comprehending are crucial.  \n\nI still have much to learn... but on the information presented here the is what I have done.\n\nI am king of MY trust...\nI still have few of liens to place still",
