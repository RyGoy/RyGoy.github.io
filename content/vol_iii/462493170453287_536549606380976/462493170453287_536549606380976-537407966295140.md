   "message": "I had a guy ask me to make him a set of disks. He was talking about Aluminum, steel even carbon fiber and giving me dimensions. Min Max thickness. Holes, slots, maybe just grooves.\nAfter 20 minutes of listening because I was having a smoke and coffee I still had no clue what he was talking about. So I stopped him and asked \"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\nHe said \"My bike, New disks for my Bike\"\nAnd everything popped into my head. Design everything.\nTHIS IS ONE OF THOSE!",
