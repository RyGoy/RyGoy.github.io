I'm in ChiefRock's group... & I have publicly stated I own clifford & his law all day long!... & Chief has remained neutral ... clifford won't debate law with ANYONE that knows about constructive jurisdictions ... his legal common law model he pushes is UCC crap... preparing people for military style law... to a more substantial degree!\"\n\nUmmm, ChiefRock, is there another \"clifford\" or \"dc\" out there that I'm unaware of? This is possibly the most incorrect and ridiculous thing I have heard to date. This shit is fucking hilarious! It's amazing the ancient wisdoms. All you have to do is be silent, and the morons come out of the woodwork and make up just about anything. I'm not sure where to even being on this? In fact, you can't. This is why I no longer throw pearls to swine.",
