   "message": "Dino....to further understand it, look into ALL the ACTS and STATUTES involving money.  Legal Tender Act of 1862, FedRes Act, EO 6102, Coinage Act of 1965, Treasury Decision in 1971.  Money is fascinating!  12 USC 411 is interesting as well as 31 USC. And it ALL comes back to the Judiciary Act of 1789 Section 34.  \n\nI think the problems we see are as much ignorance as they are corruption!",
