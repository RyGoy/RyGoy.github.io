   "message": "Thanks Adam,\n\nDefinition of 'Lawful Money'\nAny form of currency issued by the United States Treasury and not the Federal Reserve System, including gold and silver coins, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds. Lawful money stands in contrast to fiat money, to which the government assigns value although it has no intrinsic value of its own and is not backed by reserves. Fiat money includes legal tender such as paper money, checks, drafts and bank notes. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawfulmoney.asp\n\nDefinition of 'Legal Tender'\nAny official medium of payment recognized by law that can be used to extinguish a public or private debt, or meet a financial obligation. The national currency is legal tender in practically every country. A creditor is obligated to accept legal tender toward repayment of a debt. Legal tender can only be issued by the national body that is authorized to do so, such as the U.S. Treasury in the United States and the Royal Canadian Mint in Canada. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/legal-tender.asp\n\nThis ^^ seems clear.\n\nMaxims of Law seem clear enough as well.\n\nI am having only difficulty with one comment above...\n\"Words are superior claim over digits.\"\n\nDo you mean... Words have a superior claim than digits?\nOR...                Words are superior to claim digits?",
