   "message": "A TREATISE ON COMMERCIAL LAW\n\nAll crimes are commercial. See \"Title 27 C.F.R. 72.11.\" All \"crimes are commercial\" and as such a violation of \"statute.\" If you trace that word back to its origins you will find that it is a \"statutory\" or \"performance bond,\" a \"bid bond.\" A \"bid bond\" which becomes a \"lien;\" or \"debt obligation:\" which is a \"commercial asset traded on the stock exchange.\" That is where the bit about contract law comes into play. Because all \"crimes are commercial,\" it is thru a trick of law called \"admiralty\" that they convict YOU, a \"living man\" for a crime owed a \"statutory obligation\" or \"bid bond;\" a \"lien.\" That means it is all a voluntary system.\n\nThe \"legal name,\" in all capital letters, is commercial property of the federal government. It conveys a loss of \"God given\" or \"unalienable\" rights under this law structure; based on Roman Civil Law. That is why that name is \"berthed\" into commerce upon \"delivery\" of the child from the \"mother's berth canal/womb\" or \"waterway.\" And the mother is given a \"certificate\" in exchange for the true \"title\" to her baby. She is given a BIRTH CERTIFICATE see BERTH, which is like a \"Bill of Laden.\" The \"Dockter\" \"berthed\" commercial property and in exchange all the mother gets is a \"certificate of title.\" While the true or alloidial title is retained by the State via one of the many \"blind adhesions\" in the Birth Certificate contract. The world has come under a dark cloud and that cloud is \"international maritime law\" or \"admiralty\" upon which all \"citizens\" of the Earth are subject(s). \"Resident/citizens\" are \"14th amendment\" creations \"of and by the federal government.\" The \"14th amendment\" was the first time the word \"person\" was ever mentioned in any law of this land. And that is because a \"person\" is not a \"people.\" A \"citizen\" is not a \"Citizen.\" A \"person\" is \"a creation for and by the United States and one who shall immediately fall under its jurisdiction.\" See the book Black's Law 4th ed. or earlier for help defining the word \"person.\"\n\nFurthermore if you read the postal reorganization act of 1970, you will see that the use of \"zip codes\" places you within a \"federal district, territory or possession.\" If you have ever read the constitution for the United states of America 1787/1789. You would know the original constitutional federal government only has jurisdiction \"within the ten square miles known as Washington D.C., and all other \"federal\" territories and possessions.\" To put all that together for you: Residents of the United States, which is \"a corporation;\" see 28 U.S.C. 3002(15)A, are employees of the federal government. Whom have signed blind adhesion contracts in \"admiralty\" that conspire collectively to turn \"people\" into \"persons\" and to deprive them of all constitutional due process and rights. Making them completely a statutory \"person,\" endowed with nothing other than what the creator/father-god/government wants for its \"children.\" Don't be misled, all \"residents\" are \"children\" of the federal government; commercial property given a bond number in commerce, traded on international markets. That number on the back of your S.S. card (should be in red or blue) is a \"cusip.\" Know what that is? By signing these contracts you place yourself into the \"commercial and territorial waters\" of the \"State of California,\" for instance; which is a \"commercial and territorial possession\" of the \"District of Colombia.\" The \"State of California\" belongs to the Federal government. And all of its \"residents/citizens\" are \"chattel property\" of the \"State.\" We are and have been under a state of Martial Law since Abraham Lincoln declared it so in 1863. See \"the enrollment Act of 1863.\" The whole Nation has been turned into one giant corporation, see the \"District of Colombia Organic Act of 1870,\" floating in \"international waters.\" Whereby all of its \"citizens\" are its \"commercial property\" and can be taken in as \"surety\" every time they \"offend\" \"code or statute\" and have a \"lien\" placed on their physical body. Though that \"lien\" can be discharged just \"for entertainment purposes only.\" See GSA form OF-90 and 91.\n\nThe purpose for the document was to establish with the powers that be that we \"inhabit\" the \"physical place/ space/ time\" known as the \"California Republic\" or \"California\" state. Not in a state, but \"on the land.\" Not in a \"state of confusion,\" not in the \"commercial and territorial waters of D.C.\" \"Located on the physical land mass, not in a state or territorial possession of the federal government.\" \"I am not on the citizen(s)ship.\" I am \"One of the People,\" which incidentally makes me a state's Citizen under the de jure \"common law.\" A man endowed with \"unalienable\" rights not \"inalienable\" privileges. \"I am a state's Citizen from the Common Law Republic of Georgia state,\" an independent and Sovereign territory and possession of \"We the People.\" One of the Several states which first attempted to form that \"most perfect Union.\" A \"Citizen of the federal Republican Union between the Several states,\" and \"One from the Several state's United.\" See the \"Postal Authorization Act of 1792,\" for help in understanding all the subtle use of language and its true meaning. Because we are and always have been a Constitutional Republic under all mighty God whereby all the \"people\" of this land are \"endowed with unalienable rights that neither man nor institutions of government can abrogate.\" \"A state's Citizen; One of the People from the Several states mentioned in the Constitution for the United states, 1787/1789..\" \n\nWith \"persons\" like yourself trying to teach people falsely, this once great \"Republic\" has become nothing more than a \"democratic oligarchy\" ruled by fat cats and despots. Anyone out there tired of getting stepped on. Educate yourself as to the nature of this beast. Because it is all simply \"commercial maritime law\" under \"admiralty\" which turns \"people\" into \"persons.\" See \"Title 8 Section 7 U.S.C.:\" all \"citizens are vessels, and as such commercial maritime property.\" To get back to what I was saying. I am a \"Citizen\" and a \"National.\" Of the \"Nation\" known as \"America.\" Not of the corporate \"United States.\" Notice the difference between \"Citizen/National\" and \"Resident/citizen.\" A \"National is not a citizen.\" A \"National\" is One of the \"People.\" A \"citizen\" is a \"person created by and for the Federal government.\" Which is now a corrupt \"de facto\" bent on world domination. \n\nThe reason for putting it into the journal; it is the local paper of record. We put our affidavits into the \"commercial arena\" via the \"local paper of record.\" We then wait 30 days and it becomes a matter of \"public record,\" a matter of \"public law\" or \"statute.\" One final thought, I know that \"U.C.C. 1-308\" does not provide for remedy other than to let the other party know that you are signing \"in propria persona.\" \"With a full retention of all your constitutional rights still intact.\" Don't you see that every contract we sign with the federal government is unconstitutional.. Because they use those contracts to take away your rights from God and give you only \"civil rights\" or \"privileges\" granted from the government. So as the \"living man:\" as \"a living soul,\" not as the \"strawman\" or \"stramineus homo.\" And that is what \"U.C.C. 1-308\" is truly for; \"signing contracts and retaining all unalienable rights and liberties while doing so.\" You are confusing \"remedies,\" the \"remedy\" you are looking for is found under \"U.C.C. 2-209.\" Which states in brief that \"a party subject to a contract has ten days to \"rescind\" that offer.\" As well, if you are still with me, see \"California Civil Code 1689(B)1;\" which states in brief that when \"an offer is forced ''under-duress,'' ''coercion,'' 'threat of loss to real time property,'' ''threat of enslavement,'' or ''mistaken identity'' etc., that offer can be \"rescinded\" unilaterally for all time.\" Returning all parties to the \"status quo ante.\" \n\nFinally because \"all crimes are commercial\" anything you put into the \"commercial arena\" can be turned into a \"crime; or offense of code, a debt obligation owed.\" It is always best to \"reserve your rights\" when making \"deposits\" into \"commerce.\" ... All rights reserved. Without Prejudice. \"U.C.C. 1-308.\"",
