   "message": "First of all, what have I done is not worth of response. Second I am not starving and own my own home free and clear on 3 acres that I built. Third, I am already known being that I got over 10 years of charges dismissed in my activist career, which you don't know about that included escape and 3 resisting arrests. And my currency is better than yours and is organic. I already done starved them since 1990 when I refused to pay the IRS (an agency of the IMF) 10 grand for taxes on an inheritance. But you wouldn't know about that either. Or making the DEA return a mini-14 back in 2001 a friend got seized without due process. You wouldn't know about the 3+ traffic tickets I refused for fraud pursuant to FRCP 9 b since 2000 either I bet. Or how I don't have or need permits for the last two homes I built while you were probably still living in your mom's basement. LMAO. You have no idea who I am or my record. Christ dude, I just did a few weeks for contempt. Tried to arrest a judge in open court! Go play some XBoox 360 and get out of the legal consultation because you suck boy.",
