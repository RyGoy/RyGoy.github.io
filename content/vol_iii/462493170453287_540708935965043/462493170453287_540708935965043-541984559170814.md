   "message": "Timothy is banned, but I wanted to ask some questions I always make to \"freeman\"/\"patriots\"/\"sovereigns\": 1- Do YOU know HOW ANY law applies to YOU? 2- Show me PROOF that the Constitution and/or The Bill of Rights applies to YOU.  Another question I ask them is: 3- How can you say you are \"above the line\", \"living in the private\", and/or \"sovereign,\" but yet quote UCC and use \"legal tender\"? \n\nThe only \"answers\" I get come from BELIEVE, and NEVER FACTS. Specially from money hungry/money loving \"christians\". They sure pull EVERYTHING out of their ass, when it comes to \"law\". They like to quote the Bible to somehow magically explain their \"procedures.\"",
