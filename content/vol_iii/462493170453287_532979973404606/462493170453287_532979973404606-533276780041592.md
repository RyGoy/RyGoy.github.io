   "message": "Scott Duncan, I used it so much that I beaten the thing into my head. 6 times I used it alone for \"possession of marijuana\" charges. ALL withdrawn(didn't bother liening).\n\nI also used it for 2 charges of uttering a death threat to cops. 1 was flipping the bird. The other I told the cop to \"die\".\n\nThe last marijuana charge I didn't have time to get a notice of mistake but I had it drilled in my head, so I told them that I must make an affidavit orally. My affidavit was the same shit in the notice. Sufficient to say the charge was dropped.\n\nNow I smoke weed around cops and I am left alone.",
