   "message": "lets take it further. This notice of mistake applies to ALL COURTS. Including restraining orders, Child Support Payments and other similar things that you may encounter.\n\nWhen I was talking to Scott Duncan, he said to lien the case file so you can claim all the equity(right term?) in that case file. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but now that I see that a court file number is just a business account number for the province of Ontario, it HAS YOUR NAME. CLAIM THE FILE NUMBER and EVERYTHING IN IT.\n\nYou can then direct it how you see fit.",
