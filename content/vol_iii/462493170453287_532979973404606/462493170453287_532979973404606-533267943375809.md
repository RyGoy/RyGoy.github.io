   "message": "This is even more obvious that the COURTS do not care what you say most often. Why take the chance and HOPE you can win when you can kill it before it even starts.\n\nThat is why it is even more important that everyone understands the NOTICE OF MISTAKE. It always has been just about accounting. Therefor, you already lost(unless you have a fucking amazing clear cut case against the crown).\n\nDon't waste your time dealing with clubhouse rules(with very few exceptions) as the reasons are:\n\n1. You are not part of the club.\n2. You are not qualified\n3. You are not surety unless you consent and agree with FULL knowledge\n4. You do not know or have understanding of ALL of THEIR LAWS.\n5. Contract = Law. This is important. Notice of Mistake rebuts all presumptions that contracts has been made past present and future.",
