   "message": "so since they remove or omitted province of Ontario listing, what other way to get it shown that JUSTICE operating as the PROVINCE OF ONTARIO.\n\nThis just goes to show that ever case or proceeding is already stacked against you because the crown attorney AND the JUSTICE presiding over the case both have a vested interest to profit and therefor require you to give your time and labour to GET that money to PAY for the FINES that the COURT ORDERED YOU to PAY AND/OR imprison YOU because YOU APPEARED without REBUTTING the JURISDICTION of the COURT.",
