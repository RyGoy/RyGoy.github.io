   "message": "Chad, I think perhaps one of the main points of my posting was missed.  Like it or not, as the party having requested use of the corporation, which the State writes the rules for, you are responsible for ensuring it fulfills its obligation.  These obligations, as well as the rights of a corporation, are detailed in statute.  They have no duty to disclose or otherwise explain the term you are bound by (statute) to you.  You do  know the maxim - ignorance of the law is no excuse.  As for the legal duties of the  corporation and it officers and directors,  you will likely receive a response stating that if you are unsure of same  you should contact a lawyer.  And while I see where Robert Cormier is coming from, I suspect that the provisions of the statutes (the rules that apply to corporations) allow for unsigned or electronic signatures.  Respectfully, I think you are just spinning your wheels and the exercise will not be a good investment of your energy.  But I wish you all the best.",
