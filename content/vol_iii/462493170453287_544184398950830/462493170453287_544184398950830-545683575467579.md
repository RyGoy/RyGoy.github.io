   "message": "If some one sends you some thing that affects you, would you not want to know who in case they are wrong leaving you some one to address for remedy?\n\nA signature. Some one accepting liability for their actions should they be wrong.\n\nAs to comments and replies regarding posts. Yes it is frustrating to have comments not on topic.\n\nI posted an article to be critiqued,  Not as to if I have liabilities or how to get out of, or circumvent. I would ask a question regarding my post.\n\nDid I miss any thing regarding the questioning of every item that could be questioned?\n\nAre there flaws in the method of questioning.?\n\nIs the structure of my questioning flawed and if so then how.?\n\nIs the grammar used unbiased, without myself making statements?\n\nLike I said in the post, the more critical the comments the better. (To the post)\n\nPlease re-read the top portion of the post. Not the pending reply part.\nNot giving flak here just attempting to gain insight in methods and structure of legal documents.",
