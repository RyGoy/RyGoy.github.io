But where your human rights are concerned, that is those rights not granted by Her Majesty, you may be able to put forward facts which establish a breach of trust and confidence and/or fiduciary duty by the State, thereby nullifying any social compact (statutory) liabilities and duties as a result of thier breaches of duties owed to you as a man.",
