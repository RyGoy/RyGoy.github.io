Have spent a bit of time (Okay,,,2 whole days) writing and re-writing a reply formed in a series of questions regarding this said Notice. Posting a semi finished reply here for thoughts of other members regarding the reply. I wrote this version up on purpose of NOT referencing any other documentation from here or other sources just to see how well I could do from memory and gained knowledge. \nI know that there are sources of better phrasing regarding certain parts but I wanted to stand alone with what I could come up with even if I had to verbally respond in a situation such as court. I see this as an exercise in being able to train my mind to think objectively with no outside assistance either from documents and/or other peoples help.\nComments no matter how critical would be welcome. :)\nmmmm Okay, having problems posting the zip.
