   "message": "I haven't seen my suggestion in this forum, however I have had success with it. I'm not sure if I was merely lucky, or, if I was on track and therefore suggest that you take this advice with a grain of salt: Prior to mounting an \"attack\" you might send something similar to the following: Dear Mr. Flaherty, I received this document in the mail. As it is not signed, I am unable to confirm its validity. I suspect it is a forgery and someone has initiated a hoax upon me. Please be advised I do not communicate with paper or other inanimate objects. If this document was sent by you, or, one of your agents, please resend it an be sure to sign it, or, have one of your agents sign it so I can be certain that it was constructed and sent by you or one of your agents. If I, or anyone, has lead you to believe that I am willing to attempt to communicate with inanimate objects, including unsigned paper, that would be a mistake. Please forgive me. If I do not receive a response from you, or, one of your agents, with your signature, or, the signature of one of your agents on such a document within 21 days, I will understand that the enclosed letter was a forgery, and is in fact an instance of MAIL FRAUD, and, or, PUBLIC MISCHIEF, and I will report it as such to the Postmaster General.",
