   "message": "I, Me, My, You....\nWe, One...\n\n   I have been pondering circumstances and language.  I do not want to have any / all surety attached to me in certain situations.  In others utilize surety as a tool...\n   So as part of my own growth, and knowledge base expansion...\nOne is now going to use the knowledge we have gained to value the right things... which turn out to be... wrong.  Fuck\n  We have shared openly about the Creation of our Trust... \n  One is tired of valuing who is who, what is what, one just wants to learn how to take care of oneself in all situations. One will not take part any longer in any discussions about personalities or who's a cop... \nOne does not FUCKING Care. We are her to learn and be useful to a whole.\n  Most of us are here by invite no matter who we are...\n    \nSo if one is a cop, a freetard, human, person what the fuck ever...\nOne is still here to add value in whatever form that happens to take at a particular moment.  Get a fucking grip people.\n\nYour Fellow traveller.\nJay",
