   "message": "I HAVE to do it. I promised to.\n\nI don't have to abide ignorance and belief. The notion that I must \"respect\" the idiocy of the programming people embrace (and they DO embrace it) is one of the main reasons that I have such harsh responses when such idiocy is presented as \"truth\" that I must \"disprove\".\n\nPeople fare MUCH better here when they accept that they ARE programmed. This is why they think wrong, and value the wrong things.",
