   "message": "programming is a powerful thing...most don't realize they even are programmed. The way one feels about themselves has alot to do with it ;) \n\nMuch of our programming results from our being forced to submit to others way of thinking and perspective. I think most that have been banned from this group or take issue with Scott,  have trouble seeing that we aren't being forced to submit to Scott, but  to ourselves. It's quite amazing how we've been manipulated, so many layers, I'm happy to be aware of it, to recognize it and begin to unravel it.",
