   "message": "I posted this on Trent's page, if you don't think it's accurate Scott Duncan, you can remove from the TFL. \n\nI'm grateful to Scott for various reasons...he may be alot of things but one thing I trust in him is that he is not a liar....if you reread the convo...you will notice that the suggestion was made that he lied. That is an ad hominen attack..\n\nAd hominem attacks during discussions = loss of credibility + no increased awareness/learning\n\nAn ad hominem (Latin for \"to the man\" or \"to the person\"[1]), short for argumentum ad hominem, is an argument made personally against an opponent instead of against their argument.[2] Ad hominem reasoning is normally described as an informal fallacy,[3][4][5] more precisely an irrelevance \n\nThe piece of information he was explaining is a KEY to freedom. I always say, if you can make it in that group you can make it anywhere...I'm forced to critically think everything before I post a question even.  That in itself goes against our programming which is what makes the group so valuable. \n\nThe other thing is, none of it is personal, even the law is not personal, it's our own ignorance that gives us that impression. We all comprehend that our person is different then us the living being. In the group, think as a living being (critically), but recognize that the 'person' is our programming. When Scott responds, it's the 'person' thinking/programming that he is responding to,  not the living being.",
