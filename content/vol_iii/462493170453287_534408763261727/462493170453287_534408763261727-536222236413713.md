   "message": "So even though i did t need to go to court i still want to know what would happen.\n\nMe- My voids stands on those orders. It is non negotiable.\n\nJustice- send him back to the jail cell.\n\nIm thinking the only way you can deal with that is just file a writ of hab. I sit in some courts. And some of these justices are corrupt as hell.\n\nScott i must ask after the above scenario. Does justices know they are liable is that why they try to get you to sign sonething or convince you so hard to reconsider or whatever?",
