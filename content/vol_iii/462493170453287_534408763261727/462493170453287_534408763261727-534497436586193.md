   "message": "Re:  ChiefRock Sino General's Questions:\n\nObjection, point of order: How can I be expected to respond when I am unable to understand the nature and cause of these proceedings?  \n\nIsn't it true that there are questions before the court that MUST be answered before it can determined if a defendant exists, who the defendant is and if they are capable of making any sort of plea or if anyone else here is even capable of making a plea on their behalf? \n\nDo you need me to read these questions into the public record so they can be dealt with or will you accept the Notice of Mistake as sufficient notice of the questions that need resolving? \n\nPS:  Remember Captain Scott Duncan, one hand for you, one for the boat...stay safe.",
