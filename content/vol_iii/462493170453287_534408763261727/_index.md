A Justice will say idiotic things, and the idiocy ISN'T COUNTERED. People don't know what to say.\n\nNow it's MY turn to take the role of YOU. Post the last thing that stumped you in an engagement with the government. I will give the PROPER response.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE IS TENDERED! TRY STUMP SCOTT! HIT ME WITH YOUR HARDEST ONES! \n\nGO!",
