   "message": "So you will have 2 choices\n\nAsk them for an INVOICE with the description of goods they have sold to you, which they will never be able to do.\n\nOr you ACCEPT the bill of exchange and send it back to them the way I have described a few posts up.\n\nTheir duty when they receive the bill as ACCEPTED is not clear, but I think they have to send it to the receveur general, and then the receveur general send it to the Bank of Canada, and then the bank of Canada send the fund to the collection agency....not too sure about that, but It dosen't seems to be my problem anyway....maybe Derek Moran can put his 2 cents on this...",
