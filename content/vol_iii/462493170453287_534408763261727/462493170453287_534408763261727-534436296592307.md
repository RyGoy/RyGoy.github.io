   "message": "Notice of mistake is not a key unless you know how to hold it. If you dont know how to hold it dont bother. Especially if you do not understand the fundamentals of the whole thing. Keep in mind, contract are dynamic, which means they can move, so if you feel a piece a paper is your win, try again, it only got you past the front door, now your oral skills will have to come into play and you can verbally kill a notice of mistake by your own oral mistakes ...dont be so confident in a piece of paper.",
