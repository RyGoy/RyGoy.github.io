   "message": "I'm not implying anything Mr. Duncan. I am stating that you have proven to the court's satisfaction that you are not competent to defend yourself in these matters. Until such time, as you can satisfy this court that your implied competency to represent yourself is qualified as a fact, and or, you have been recognized and certified by an accredited organization, educational institution or society, you fail to prove to the courts satisfaction that you are competent. Having read a few books on law doesn't qualify you. Do you possess a law degree Mr. Duncan, obtained from a government accredited and recognized institution?",
