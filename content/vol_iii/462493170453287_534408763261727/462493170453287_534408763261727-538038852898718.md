   "message": "my nephew was up in court this morning, he was waiting for 2nd call, the justice copped me walking in late & sitting beside him, the justice immediately called the case & struck out in the same breath, a garda followed us to the door & watched us walk away & into a coffee shop. Minutes later a well spoken man walked in, up to our table & inquired if we were \"the freemen\"which we denied & asked for definition (4 of us in unison :p ) was i the guy from YT, i asked who he was & told me he was the court reporter, he inquired about my intentions, i briefly explained liability & surety attached to those who'd attacked my rights. I went outside for a smoke & he followed me, I asked him who sent him that the video on YT didn't show my face, he asked me was i happy & why i was doing this, \"I want the return of the proper function of law, i am far from spent & every encounter will only strengthen me... go back & tell the judge that\" he dropped his sholulders & sloped off.... all i could do was strut haha",
