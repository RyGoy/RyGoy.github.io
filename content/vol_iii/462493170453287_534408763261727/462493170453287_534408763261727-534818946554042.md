   "message": "in my recent case i backed one justice into a jurisdiction hearing with questions, he recused himself & next justice decided it would be handier to skip the plea & begin the hearing. i've learned from you that there are no judges so private prosecution is pointless? you did mention he accepted surety upon doing so but how do we enforce?",
