   "message": "I've got a good one. I heard a Judge tell a woman in family court that she couldn't have a boyfriend. Then the Judge replied \"but I'm not saying get a girlfriend and be a lesbian either\" then the court officials all laughed at her seemingly IDIOTIC joke. The woman who was actually the plaintiff in this custody battle ensuing in all silliness was dumbfounded. She had NO CLUE how to respond.",
