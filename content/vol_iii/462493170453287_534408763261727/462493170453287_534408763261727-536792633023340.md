   "message": "Everyone is entitled to a fair hearing Mr. Duncan. This is a founding principle of law. Your ignorance of this fact establishes your ignorance of the law. I would be remiss in my duties if I allowed these proceedings to continue without providing you with competent assistance in these matters. Case adjourned until July 20th, by which time Mr. Duncan will have an opportunity to meet with his assigned council and whereby he will return to this court with n accredited member of the bar association to assist him in these proceedings. Next Case Bailiff?",
