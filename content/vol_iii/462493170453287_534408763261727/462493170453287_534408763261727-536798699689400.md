   "message": "I have responded that you are not competent to defend yourself. This has been established by your refusal to answer in the affirmative to my question regarding your accreditation which would satisfy this court that you are capable of representing yourself. Anyone with standing may ask questions of this court, however, only competent persons can defend themselves. Competence is established in this court by providing proof of your abilities. This court does not recognize competency based on hearsay. I ask you again, do you have an accredited education in law, certified by a recognized educational institution?",
