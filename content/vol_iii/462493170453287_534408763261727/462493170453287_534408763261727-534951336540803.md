   "message": "ward n. 1) a person (usually a minor) who has a guardian appointed by the court to care for and take responsibility for that person. A governmental agency may take temporary custody of a minor for his/her protection and care if the child is suffering from parental neglect or abuse, or has been in trouble with the law. Such a child is a \"ward of the court\" (if the custody is court-ordered) or a \"ward of the state.\" 2) a political division of a city, much like a council district.",
