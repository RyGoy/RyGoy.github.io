   "message": "Let us rip it apart to the basics.\n1) They keep asking because they can only deal with the TRUSTEE for the person.\n2) You can be either the BENEFICIARY *or* the TRUSTEE.\n3) They ONLY want to speak to the TRUSTEE so SURETY for the matter can be TRANSFERED *from* them to you. (Who wants to be surety for anything?)\n4) The *ISSUE* at hand is to NOT ACCEPT becoming the TRUSTEE.\n5) They can ONLY speak *with* authority to one of their own. The above 4 items are based on this. If you are not part of our organization then what the fuck are you doing here? They could if they wanted even Charge you with IMPERSONATING an OFFICER.\n.\nIf the above is incorrect in anyway please correct. :)",
