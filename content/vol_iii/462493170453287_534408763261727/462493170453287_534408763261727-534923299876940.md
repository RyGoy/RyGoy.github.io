   "message": "Alright.\n\nDealing with orders and a restraining order. Let me get this straight.\n\nI go in, they refuse to give me originals, ok thats cool. Then i request they make certified true copies.\n\nI take those and stamp VOID onto the placeholder of the signature regardless if its there or not. I take the agreement also and VOID that.\n\nThe restraining order i actually have a certified true copy of it so i stamp VOID on that.\n\nI take the now voided orders back to the court clerk and i simply file it into the record...(Scott does it go in by itself? or in afffidavit and what is written in the affidavit?)...I obviously send notice or copies to the opposing party to notify them that it has been voided.\n\nI take the restraining order to the police station to notify them that a restraining has been voided....you know...to avoid unneccesary arrests....\n\nScott Duncan did i get this right?",
