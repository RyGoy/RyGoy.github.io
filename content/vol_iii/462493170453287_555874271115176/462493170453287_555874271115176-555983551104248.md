   "message": "Australian Constitution, the real one that hasn't been repealed, states that we have the right to Free Travel. The Quick & Garran interpretation is too long to include here. In simple speak it means as Free Travellers in our 'automobile' not for hire or reward (as opposed to a motor vehicle ... see below) we do not require a licence and, indeed, the 'automobile' does not require registering. So far we do not know of anyone who has actually exercised that right.\nA 'motor vehicle', on the other hand, is used for hire/reward by a 'driver'.\nWe suggest reading up on Black's Law Dictionary.",
