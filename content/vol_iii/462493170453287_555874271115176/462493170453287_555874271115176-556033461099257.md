   "message": "Just had a revelation about driving. We can create persons; we never accept surety. Persons a just a costume we use. So, could we create a person who DRIVES around thier legal person and then we complete the bill of exchange. So different persons do all of these tasks for us, we arent concerned with other peoples psychology, and everyone is happy. An accountant figures out the accounts. What do we think about this?",
