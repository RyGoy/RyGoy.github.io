   "message": "This is a bit of a long post, but, it encompasses several ideas encountered here at TFL. Forgive me if I seem to ramble.\n\nIn response to a request to Scott Duncan, wherein he was solicited to propose  suggestions/solutions/remedies to the difficulty faced by those wanting to TRAVEL in their PRIVATE, NOT FOR HIRE property, without being accosted by men with guns, and, or having their property seized, Scott suggested that we do not drive ourselves. \n\nFor me, and, judging by the posts of others, the answer seemed to be an obvious reference to a common theme here at TFL, specifically the (generalized) �mantra�: do not expect justice from the courts (government agents etc.) as it is tantamount to appealing to your rapist to treat you fairly. \n\nERGO (at least in MY MIND): Don�t steer yourself around in that technology. If, however, you choose/desire to do so in the capacity of a man/woman, and should you suffer a TORT while lawfully traveling in your private property, do not expect to be provided a remedy, and, certainly do not expect any justice. Bottom line�don�t own a car and attempt to use it by yourself if wish to be somewhat protected from the harm that such use can bring you. \n\nOn a personal note, and possibly for other members, this was, and is, �a very hard pill to swallow�. \n\nAnyways, after weeks of considering/contemplating the implications of the above, I sat down with my son this morning and we watched the documentary �HOT COFFEE�. (I recommend it -  for whatever that�s worth.)\n\nThe film examines the extensive efforts by corporations and such to limit the ability of men and woman to receive compensation and, or justice to TORTS which they may incur. A fortified and revitalized global effort to deny us justice, was seen by the filmmakers largely as a response to (amongst other suits) the litigation brought forward by the old woman who spilled coffee on herself and subsequently successfully sued McDonalds.\n\nWhile watching this documentary, Scott�s advice regarding the use of a car (as described above) kept returning to my mind. I began to wonder (MOVIE SPOILER ALERT), since almost every useful technology and service available to us today is provided to us with one or all of the following: \n\na) a MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT which waives our right to seek justice from any other source other than your rapist, and, or, you must first agree to never inform the public of any harm you become aware of which is caused by that company/service etc. \n\nb) INDEMNIFICATION of the company/service from our government (think drugs and vaccines for example) in which the government has passed acts and statutes protecting drug companies from any damages they would otherwise be responsible for (even if they know/knew their products were/are harmful, toxic, poisonous, cancer causing etc.)\n\nc) TORT LIMITS, which more often than not put the burden of costs related to recovery, treatment etc. are without recourse foisted upon the victim, and, or, the public; \n\nNow, it seems, there are dozens of tough pills for me swallow. SHOULD WE, AS CONSCIENTIOUS MEN AND WOMAN, wishing to avoid harm to ourselves and others, USE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES when, by their very use, we are quite likely AGREEING to be COMPLICIT in any and all unscrupulous acts perpetrated by the companies/services/organizations, and, additionally, are likely agreeing to be bound by a provision to never bring any such devious treatment of customers/clients/users - to the attention of the public?\n\nIt has just dawned on me, after watching the movie, that following the logic of the car example above, and, given the even more extreme ramifications of a), b), and c) mentioned above concerning other technologies etc. ;  perhaps we would be best protected from harm to ourselves and others by not engage in commerce to secure our ability as men and women to use telephones, cell phones, internet, health insurance, medical care/treatment, etc. \n\nHow can we, if at all, protect ourselves, should we desire to use other products/technologies/services/organizations etc. which come with clauses such as those described above?\n\nAm I way off track and over thinking this? Questions and comments are encouraged as always. Thanks. :)",
