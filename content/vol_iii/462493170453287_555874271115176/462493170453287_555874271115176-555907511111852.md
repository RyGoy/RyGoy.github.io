   "message": "Problems remain however. For example, I ordered a phone from Rogers a number of years ago. Inside the box containing the phone was a contract that stated that I was bound to the terms of the contract inside the box, if I opened the box. Wrap your head around that one. Anyways, after a call to Rogers, asking how could I be considered to be in agreement with a contract which I haven't read. They told me they post their policies online (amongst other places) and that as a consumer it was my responsibility to educate myself about the products/services/contracts which I involve myself with.",
