   "message": "What ive learned about contracting- is that you have to not only make your Terms-and-Conditions EXPRESSLY known, you have to make them known up-front from-the-get-go to make them solid, as opposed to relying on an 'IMPLIED CONSENT'-agreement that could later on be judicially interpreted the WRONG way against you...\n\n\"If within 30 calendar days i have not heard back from you, then I SHALL take your SILENCE as YOUR IMPLIED CONSENT that YOU have, through TACIT-AGREEMENT-BY-YOUR ACQUIESCENCE, conceded to the FACTS-IN-LAW that I have made through your NON-CONTENTION of the 3 (THREE) NOTICES I have sent to YOU previously, that YOU have CHOSEN NOT to REBUT, that in-fact, this is the proper way of marking a bill-of-exchange as the proper method for the discharge and/or set-off of a debt to a biller, in this case YOU, as i have described it as i understand it, in my 3 (THREE) NOTICES i have previously sent.\"",
