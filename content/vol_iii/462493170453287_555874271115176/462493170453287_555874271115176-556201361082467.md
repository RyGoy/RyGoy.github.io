   "message": "The other question:\n\nCan the corporation lien the name without having established the private trust?\n\nYes, but why would you?  It doesn't take the name out of the public realm.\n\nThe corporation is considered as another person, in the same way as the person you are liening is (in the same way that both are registered with the government).  \n\nBecause the corporation is registered with/through the state, it has the same capacity as the 'person' you are liening (I think).  The state/government would still have the right to require/demand the details of the trust, its establishment etc.\n\nHowever, once the name is liened into a private trust (taking it out of the public realm), and it is merely held by the corporation (which is another person in law & fulfils the requirement of trust law), the government and its agents are unable to attempt to attach surety to the person because it is no longer in the public system.",
