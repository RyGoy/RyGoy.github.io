   "message": "I'm thinking outloud here...our ability to discharge debt is our opportunity to claim for our labour that the person was pledged for in the bankruptcy? In doing so because all is accounting, we actually shrink the countries debt. Scott has talked numerous times about becoming our own banks. Wouldn't we want to discharge the debt (to decrease the countries debt) and then create our own currency to take the \"power\" the bank presently has over us? Does that make any sense?\n\nScott Duncan The GOVERNMENT owes the debt. They owe it to the banks.\n\nScott Duncan You'll find that you OWE the market. There are no DIVIDENDS, until the DEBT is paid.",
