   "message": "Oh... I was thinking HARD about that stuff too :D even OVERTHINKING maybe, but that's another story... :D\n\nWell, my thoughts are...If they REALLY want the person I happen to have in my pocket, to travel to fulfill its DUTY, I guess that person has to HIRE someone to do this.....in fact, that person dosen't even have arms to fit the steering wheel of a car,\n\nSo that person MAY hire a driver ?, and since \"ME\" have no intentions of dealing with these taxes collectors who carry guns, well that person I have in my pocket can find someone else than \"ME\" to go around town doing business :D\n\nSo if I ask this limo company to send a Bill of Exchange addressed to the person named:\n\nPIERRE DAOUST\n26X-XXX-XXX\n1234 fucks the puppy road\nCrazytown (Quebec) Canada\nH1H 1H1\n\nAnd ask to get paid in advance for a full month of SERVICE, well in that case \"ME\" who is the best SOLE authorized administrator of PIERRE DAOUST, can do the RIGHT thing with this Bill of Exchange......accept it, sign it, date it and send it registered mail to the Drawee, which can only be the Bank of Canada, so they can send the payment to the beneficiary, which can only be this limo company :D\n\nAnd then, EVERYONE will live happy and have a long life.....\"ME\", the PERSON and the Limo Corp. !!!!!!!!!",
