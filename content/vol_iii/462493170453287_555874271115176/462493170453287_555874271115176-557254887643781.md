   "message": "Found this somewhere:\n\n�Money� is a vague term. Technically, anything can serve as money. And historically, many things have served as �money�. As a social construct �money� is really nothing more than a tool\nthat helps us interact in our everyday lives. The history of �money� is lost in time, but there is ample evidence of forms of monetary systems in primitive monkeys in which sexual favors are traded in exchange for protection, grooming and other �bonds�.",
