   "message": "Thinking of money and crypto-currencies. When I think of the hope that I have for Bitcoin and such, I am reminded of my favorite philosopher, Thoreau, speaking about laws changing to include a new idea (in his example he wrote about the abolishment of slavery). Then my hopes are kept on a short leash. Essentially he warned us that new ideas are only ever accepted as valid and legal by government, when it is \"expedient\" for them to do so. History is replete with examples which support this stance.",
