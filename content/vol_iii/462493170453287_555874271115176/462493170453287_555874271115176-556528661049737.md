   "message": "It's why I loathe you all. You are all too stupid/ignorant/apathetic to even knowingly question the issues. Now the banks own the courts. There's no remedy.\n\nHell, you people don't even know what money IS, and that's what the fucking group is about!\n\nThat's why I'm being busy creating cryptographic currencies and being called \"crazy\" to this day for doing so. Your ignorance does not equal my knowledge, and I simply have no time for those who incorrectly think otherwise.\n\nAll of what's to come over the next 180 days, was created by all of you, and your worthless parents.  ...and yes, I CAN apply that to all of you! If your parents weren't worthless eaters, they would have taught you what money is, and you wouldn't be HERE.",
