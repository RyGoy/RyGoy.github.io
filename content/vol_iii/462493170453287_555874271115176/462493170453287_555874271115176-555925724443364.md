   "message": "Sir / Madam,\n\nThis is the FOURTH letter I sent you on the same subject, that is to say, to know what other ways exist to discharge this bill that you send me other than to use the trust money.\n\nThe law on bills of exchange RSC (1985) says that you have the responsibility to explain it to me.\n\nBut you continue to maintain complete silence.\n\nSo after my research on the law on bills of exchange RSC (1985), here is my understanding.\n\nEvery 60 days, you send me a bill that you undertake for me when I get the bill, I have two choices:\nRedeem debt and send you a check, or complete the bill of exchange in the ACCEPTING, by dating, signing, affixing my account number (SIN or no. Registration of birth certificate) and to reach the Bank of Canada so that they can give you the funds.\n\nIn other words, I am the shooter, the Bank of Canada is fired, and you are the third party.\n\nSo, here is a copy of the original of which was sent to the Bank of Canada.\n\nThank you, and know that I am very disappointed that you remain silent to my repeated requests.\n\nWith Respect, Honor, Dignity and Integrity",
