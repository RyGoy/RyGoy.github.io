   "message": "Gail Blackman: \"I'm interested in the corp/trust possibility\" I am as well. (Rubbing hands together) I'm still trying to figure out what i can provide to Scott that he finds valuable. I don't suggest I fully understand all of that, even though the general concept seems to make sense. As I understand it presently, even the corporation which runs my trust will need to provide a signing officer to accept responsibility for the products and services that it manages for my trust. And of course, those contracts will likely include clause a), b), and c)  which again translates to bend over and accept that the entire football team gets to %^&* whomever wants to sign/accept.",
