   "message": "So the Legal Person obtains a DEBT payable to CS Corp for \"transportation\" (or \"office space\", or \"storage\", or \"administration\").  As Pete clearly stated, people with guns will lock you in a cage if the \"transporter\" doesn't have a license to drive.  So some PERSON with a LICENSE TRANSPORTS the Legal Person and sends a BILL to the Legal Person.  The AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE of the Legal Person discharges the debt.  How does the account of CS Corp become credited?",
