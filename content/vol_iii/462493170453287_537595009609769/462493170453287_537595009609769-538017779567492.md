   "message": "If you are considered a party, then you must be able to receive a copy...if you're not able to, then you can't be a party.\n\nThat's my take on it, so if that logic is correct, I would put them in a double bind:  give me a certified copy if you are claiming I'm a party (and then get the magic RED VOID stamp out)\n\nOR\n\nIf I'm NOT a party, by what authority are you doing (whatever it is that they are doing) and if I'm not a party then leave me the hell alone!\n\nIf I'm already considered a defendant or (insert legal fiction name here), then that would be a mistake, so please forgive me (and hit them with a Notice of Mistake)\n\nThe oracle Scott Duncan will be able to phrase it far more eloquently than that ;-)",
