   "message": "Providing assurance that an entity will be able to satisfy its asset retirement obligation does not sat\nisfy\nor extinguish the related liability. Methods of providing assurance include surety bonds, insurance\npolicies, letters of credit, guarantees by other entities, and establishment of trust funds or identification\nof other assets dedicated to satisfy the\nasset retirement obligation. Setting assets aside to satisfy an\nasset retirement obligation does not satisfy the criteria for offsetting the assets and the liability on the\nbalance sheet. For a previously recognized asset retirement obligation, changes in\nfunding and\nassurance provisions have no effect on the measurement of that liability. Costs associated with\ncomplying with funding or assurance provisions are accounted for separately from the asset retirement\nobligation.\n\nWhat does that mean ? :/",
