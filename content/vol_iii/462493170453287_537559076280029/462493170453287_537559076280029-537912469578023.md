   "message": "SURETY is a SECURITY within the definitions of law dictionaries. A SECURITY then is a CLAIM really, of some kind or other. If I make a deposit in my NAME, I CLAIM that deposit. If I create a BILL to you with my NAME on it, this is a CLAIM for payment. Hence, if I create a CLAIM, I am SURETY upon this until I can pin it on YOU.",
