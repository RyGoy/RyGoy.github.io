   "message": "(d) a stamp or writing that secures or evidences title to or an interest in a chattel personal, ... I remember when we were kids, someone might make a claim to ownership of something, and someone would chime in \"I don't see your name on it\". Back in the day, I also remember that after someones death, families would sometime race to write their name on furniture. Often, the writing of names on furniture would take place as the aging person would gift a possession prior to their death (to be claimed after he/she died), and instruct the person to write their name on the gifted/inheritable item. This brings me to my question: If I write my name on someones possession and they don't erase it and, or, make a claim against me for vandalism, does the writing of my name on a thing secure it? Does my written name on it evidence my title and interest in that personal chattel?",
