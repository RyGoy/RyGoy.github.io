   "message": "THAT Counter Petitioner can make no payment on any obligation or debt pursuant to the terms of the same said settlement contract until clarification of appropriate tender in payment by the Attorney General and Court is made in amendment to said contract, as herewith requested. \n3. THAT No state may make any thing but gold or silver coin tender in payment of debts (Article 1 sec 10, US Constitution), yet no payment in gold or silver may be demanded in payment of any debt or obligation ( HJR 192).  Legalese and Legalism (witchcraft and black magic to the natural law as practiced) have long since come to abrogate and contradict the Law of the land, resulting in a Conflict of Law, in Diversity Jurisdiction.\n4. THAT neither paper currency nor deposits have value as commodities, as deposits are merely book entries, and it is still a felony to tender any substitute for lawful money in many States. \n5. THAT when pressured to identify the form of money to be used to settle a judgment, the 52nd 3rd Judicial District Court of Michigan, Honorable Justice James P. Sheehy presiding, Ruled that \"coffee beans\" was money, storming out of the court room shouting : \"I don�t care if you pay it in coffee beans just so long as you pay it!\" (Montgomery Wards v Eugene Glasure case #82-002087 (1982). The judge, as in many unpublished cases, could not bring himself to violate the law in open court on record and declare Federal Reserve Notes to be lawful tender in payment of debts, so Glasure, a Michigan Native, member of the Michigan Militia and personal friend of this Writer, payed the settlement, court costs, and a few of his other debts, in \"Coffee Beans,\" and still carries a large sack of them around with him at all times down to this very day. \n6. THAT It was certainly not within the enumerated powers of Congressional authority to transfer the issuing of gold and silver certificates, and ultimately federal reserve notes, to the private Federal Reserve being a foreign power with respect to lawful government, as �Congress may not abdicate [�to give up.. renounce or relinquish�authorities, duties�powers, or responsibility] to transfer to others its legitimate [delegated] functions� Schechter Poultry v. U.S., 29 U.S., 495 U.S. 837, 842 (1935)\n7. THAT Federal Reserve Notes may very well be �legal tender� for the United States Territorial federal zone(s) under the Exclusive Legislative jurisdiction of the United States not under Constitutional protection and restrictions; However, both the Constitution and the Law of the Land lead only to one inescapable conclusion : that Federal Reserve Notes certainly are NOT Constitutional tender or lawful money for the Citizens of the 50 sovereign states in these united states of America, in fact, not fiction, outside corporate jurisdiction of law were dead ghosts and fictional persons dwell in commerce, that now and here corrupt and poison the lawful operation of all local governments and courts.",
