They work for a King/Queen who fucking lives in England THEY ARE NOT ORIGINALLY FROM THESE LANDS, even if they were born here. Their people are originally from England. So point in fact, police are either one, contracting with you, or two: pressing on a dictatorship upon folks...so am i to believe Canada is a dictatorship ? Cause if i cannot determine my own worth and trust me im damn expensive when it comes to any Court or Police who wanna assault or press their laws against me. I have the right to contract for whatever the amount i wish for MY TIME, not your time, MY FUCKING TIME. Dont tell me i cant determine my worth ...your not my Creator nor an authority ...anyways this article didnt mention the amount of people POLICE KILL IN A YEAR, lets just go within a month, im sure its a hell of alot more than 6.
