   "message": "Can you define PERSON? Are you referring to a particular trust? Which trust would that be?\n\nI�m I not BENEFICIARY and GRANTOR of the TRUST?\n\nAs BENEFICIARY and GRANTOR of the TRUST, am I not entitled to tender FRNs?\n\nIs the juristic PERSON not one of my securities? Do you have any facts or evidence that rebuts the presumption that I am the BENECIARY & GRANTOR of the trust and that the LEGAL PERSON is my security and/or collateral?\n\nAs GRANTOR and BENEFICIARY of the trust, I appoint YOU trustee and wish for YOU to liquidate, offset and discharge the accounts, it matters not how YOU do it, use your CUNT if you have to, just FUCKING DO MY BIDDING BITCH � you may want to make that a question and/or negative averment.\n\nAre you refusing to fulfill your role as appointed TRUSTEE?\n\nAre you NOT in BREACH of your fiduciary obligations as trustee to make all parties whole and complete?\n\nAre you fucking RETARDED?\n\nBailiff, arrest this piece of shit for BREACH of TRUST and dispose of him in the most violent manner you can imagine � like your fellow officers do to the little citizens out in the streets � you know what I�m taking about! Wink wink\n\n;)",
