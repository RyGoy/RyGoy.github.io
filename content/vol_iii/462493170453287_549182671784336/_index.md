   "message": "Implied trust, a question about a consumer purchase. I buy a car in cash, the dealer says let us register that for you we have an express line at the MTO. I just paid in full and the dealer, without disclosure registered what I thought was my property into public stores. Is this not a breach of the trust. Did they not have the fiduciary obligation to inform me that my property was being registered for a public purpose?",
