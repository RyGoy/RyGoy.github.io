   "message": "The situation had to do with supporting a local artist by making a music vid, producing a few songs putting them up  to create awareness and distributing so he could possibly begin to make a living and doing it on a differed pay( paid a percentage of each song that sells ...lion share to artist.... on the back end) They thought I was full of shit.. \nThis guy did not get it... He stated that if He was there when he got back he was going to kill me... right in my face... His prison buddy.. stated that you better go.. cause if your here he will kill you...\nI have been threatened before... but never like that...\n\nTHE look of a stone cold killer...dead eyes... like a guy about to pull the legs of a spider.\n\nUN-known guys with a bad rep.   It seemed REAL.  \nReal enough for me not to chance it... When I went with proof of what I could do... I was again told better get the fuck out or he will kill you...  \n   Never happened before....",
