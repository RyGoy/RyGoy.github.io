   "message": "MANY of you see me use the term \"Weasel word\" in many of my critiques of your thought processes. Those whom I've banned for getting upset because I spoke the truth, didn't know it was a REAL THING, and just thought I was calling them names.\n\nIf I use a term, look it up before you start telling your idiotic Christian friends that I \"called you a weasel\". You ARE, but that's not why I said it...",
