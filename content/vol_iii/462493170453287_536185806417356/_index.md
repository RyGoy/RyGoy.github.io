   "message": "news tidbit....Sometime early last year, I signed a government document Director for: Robert Cormier. The gov worker looked at it and said I couldn't sign it in that manner and that I had to use the signature that was on my driver's license. I told her that I could draw a bunny if I wanted to, as it was my mark, and that my mark could not be dictated by the government. Anyways I was refused service for four months. Wrote them a number of letters. In the end, I was given services and my claim was back dated. More recently, I was asked to sign a government document to obtain services once again. I asked the gov worker what would happen if I didn't sign it. She said I wouldn't be given services. I told her that I didn't agree with the offered contract and that there was no \"meeting of minds\". She essentially said take it or leave it. I told her I'd sign it, which I did, and handed the document back to her. She looked at it and said \"What's this?\". She was referring to the fact that I signed it UNDER STRESS AND DURESS, followed by my signature. She said that she couldn't accept it like that and would need to speak to her supervisor.  She came back and said that her supervisor would need to take it up the chain of command. Anyways, when asked why I signed it like that, I took the document from her, put an asterisk beside my name. At the bottom of the page I put another asterisk and wrote; \"It is my understanding that I will not be given access to my trust of which I and all Canadians are beneficiaries unless I sign a contract which I don't agree with. As I need these services for my well being I signed it as indicated above.\" Several days passed. Finally, I was called and told that I would receive all benefits. Before hanging up the phone, the gov worker asked me if I'd please try to comply with the majority of their performance requirements. I said that I'd consider it and hung up.",
