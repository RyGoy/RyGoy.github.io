   "message": "I'm \"scared\" of driving around as Dean Clifford does for two reasons: a) I am single father and I could see F&CS trying to take my son away if I am in jail as he has no other LEGAL GUARDIAN. b) I am currently not in a financial position to buy vehicle after vehicle after vehicle etc. to replace those that would likely be stolen from me. This leads me to a new post that I'll type up shortly. Stay tuned. :)",
