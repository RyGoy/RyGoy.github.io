   "message": "I went to my 80 year old Uncle's old folks home to take him to his Doctors appointment just as I have done several times before.The employee/nurse presents me with a document with her employers corporate logo at the top and some spiel about him  being  semi ambulatory and other bullshit that I didn't read.She told me to sign it then I could go.I asked her why! She said the company lawyers got together and came up with this form.I told her I did not sign things crafted by lawyers.Her reply with a crazy mean intimating face was \"What do you mean you DON'T SIGN THINGS\" I retorted Just what I said I Don't sigh things! I went on to say \"look I am here to take my uncle to his appointment ,are YOU telling me that YOU will not let me take him if I don't sign that paper.I then said That is for your benefit not mine! She looks at me now smiling and says you are right,I will get him to sign it and I said YOU do that.He had to sign as surety for himself to leave his own home lol I took him to the appointment lmao!",
