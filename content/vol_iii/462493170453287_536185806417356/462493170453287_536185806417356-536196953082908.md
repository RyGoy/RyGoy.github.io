   "message": "Curiously, they claimed that MY LEGAL SIGNATURE was the one that was on my passport or drivers license and that they were legally obligated to ensure that I was legally who I claimed to be. I told them that they merely had to look at the picture of me and informed them that I could write my signature on a piece of paper in the \"old way\" just to further verify that \"I was who I claimed to be\". Footnote: I have renewed my license and wrote Director for: followed by my signature. At Service Ontario I had initially tried this with a signature and I put a box around my signature - thinking of the FOUR CORNER RULE, however, when the woman scanned the signature card in the computer scanner, her screen read \"Signature declined\", or some such similar notion. I had her call her Supervisor, who called the head, or, regional office, and they said that the government wouldn't allow me to put a box around my signature.",
