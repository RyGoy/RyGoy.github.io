   "message": "Pete Daoust: I went on Welfare when my mother became sick with cancer and needed my care 24/7. Can't collect Employment Insurance because I was an \"employer\" and not an \"employee\". Which is quite ironic because we are all considered employees. Being that I was requesting welfare benefits is what makes my case extra note worthy as I seem to recall Scott Duncan comment along the lines of...those who accept Welfare are fucked and have no rights whatsoever. PS. I'm not a bum. I've always worked hard and have been using my time to get myself set up in my own business once again. This is what I'm constructing now to become self employed (amongst other ventures) : http://hotshotstudios.net/  PS. It's starting to take off and I'll be off welfare soon.",
