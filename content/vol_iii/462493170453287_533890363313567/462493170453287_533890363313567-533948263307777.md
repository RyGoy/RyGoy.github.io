   "message": "Soooo...The gist I get is, Scott Duncan, wants to bring back REAL LAW (With real Judges and enforcement support). Wants to bring back TO THIS SEA OF COMMERCE LAW and ORDER as it was ment to be. People of Appropriate knowledge, responsibility and QUALIFIED will be needed to operate in this Admiralty Law.\nThat is my short version of what I think from reading the posts of Scott Duncan in this thread. The long version is very complex and has many many many inferences, details and methods of approach to take back the Sea of Commerce. \n:) I am all for real Law Enforcement.\nNow a chunk of previous posts and Scott's innuendo's fall into place.",
