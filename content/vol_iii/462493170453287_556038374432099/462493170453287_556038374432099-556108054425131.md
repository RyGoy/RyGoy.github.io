   "message": "I have a similar situation but they haven't threatened me with any legal action. My question is, once a summary judgement has been made in the private...after all the deadlines they seem to respond, if we don't respond to their new contract offer, does that create the assumption that we have accepted it? If that is the case, these letters could go back and forth for a while, until we take them to court  to have the public court enforce the judgement",
