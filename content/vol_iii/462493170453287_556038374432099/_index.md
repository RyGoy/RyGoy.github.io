   "message": "Bit of advice needed if anyone wants to give their 2 cents...\n\nA toll road company sent a notice to my person a while back. I responded in my private capacity asking them to clarify who Mr. O Brien was and to forward the letter to Mr. O Brien, failure to respond within 10 days will constitute legal accord and satisfaction.\n\nI received no response so I sent another letter stating that and offered 10 more days to rebut my statement. No response to that so a notice of default was then sent and delivered.\n\nHowever the solicitors who deal with the company's legal proceedings have now sent a letter pursuing the matter. I notified them that the matter has been dealt with by default and should they want to review any paperwork pertaining to the matter to contact the company's officer with whom I dealt with.\n\nThey sent another letter stating they \"work within the legal framework of this jurisdiction and will be continuing with legal proceedings against you unless x amount is cleared or unless we receive repayment proposals within 7 days\".\n\nThey state that they are to proceed against \"you\" etc.... So my confusion lies with whether or not to start the who is \"you\" process again or just return their letter as they are acting on a void claim? I don't want to write back asking for a copy of a contract because as far as i can see the matter is closed by default. Would asking for a contract imply that I'm not standing on the default?\n\n(I can post the letters I sent if required)",
