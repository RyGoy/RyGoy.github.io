   "message": "I had the SAME situation...but it was not a toll road company, it was a Police Officer that seems to work for a Corporation of some sort....\n\nHe gave \"ME\" a ticket, addressed to the person I have in my pocket.\n\nAfter some verifications, I've found out that \"ME\" and/or the person I have in my pocket, have NO contract with that corporation named The city of Montreal.\n\nSo I sent back this Bill of Exchange to them saying NO CONTRACT on it :/\n\n4 months after, I received ANOTHER bill of exchange, saying that the person I have in my pocket has been found GUILTY, and has been JUDGE :/\n\nSo, I sent them a registered mail asking for the NAME, address and inscription number of WHO entered a guilty plea on the person I have in my pocket, and the NAME address and inscription number of WHO entered a judgement on it.\n\nThey've sent me a letter back to tell me I have to CALL them to discuss this :D\n\nSo I called, with my intelligent cell phone, who record EVERYTHING that is saying on it :D\n\nThat lady, named LISE, to whom I talked to, tried to bring me EVERYWHERE else but, on those 2 simple questions I've asked.... :D\n\nAnd \"ME\", I stood like a bastard on my 2 QUESTIONS....who and who, that's ALL I want to know.....she finally admitted that a COMPUTER SYSTEM entered a guilty plea and judge the person I have in my pocket :D ...I have this on tape :D\n\nSo I sent them back a letter saying that the ONLY way a computer system can do that, is if that computer system think I am one of your employee :/ , otherwise, it's completely ILLEGAL.....\n\nI am waiting for their answer.. :D",
