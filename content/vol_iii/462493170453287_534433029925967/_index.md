   "message": "Peace!\nI was detained for driving with out a license. I am married with a suspended drivers license. However the name on my old license and my state ID (which they found after searching my vehicle for \"inventory\") are different. I mention this because I am aware that my marriage license contracts me with the state. While being bonded out of jail I was given documents to sign stating that I waive my right to see the magistrate in order to be released on bond, I signed every document presented to me \"Without Prejudice, under duress UCC 308\" however I am extremely new to this entire understanding of me vs the entity created to abide by state Codes and statutes. From my understanding I have 3 days to hand this matter on the private sector before it goes public... Is there anyone who can provide any advice, suggestions, or clarity on my options to take towards the remedy? I have been pointed in the direction of a Notice of Mistake, and plan to research this right now but I am still in need of assistance. Much appreciation.",
