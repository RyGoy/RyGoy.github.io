   "message": "Some will say \"God is making Scott Duncan tell the truth\", and that only THEY have free will... Their imaginary friend is \"making me\"... I have no free will and Magic Sky Daddy is controlling my actions... because he works in \"mysterious ways\".\n\nHere in reality: Adults with imaginary friends are stupid. They also have to choke on the ugly reality, that I give more than their all powerful sky-daddy ever will. Choke on that, you fucking nazis. I'm BETTER than you Allah, Yahweh, and/or Jesus... Oh, and Jehova too... can't forget that stupid figment.\n\nTell me theists... How do you live in brains that small?",
