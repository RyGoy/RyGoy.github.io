   "message": "Thanks Sï¿½il Eile, as much as that is bloody disturbing, it brings further clarification that most people are totally messed up by belief systems (me included...I'm still doing the pruning), but more scary is that they are willing to destroy others because their belief systems differ...\n\nWhat bothers me most from all this, is after they have condemned, destroyed, tortured, maimed, murdered etc, they then claim to be the righteous good guys....this video was just a very small scale version of what western superpowers are doing virtually every day, either actively through invasion, war etc or passively by poisoning water supplies, introduced chemicals into the foodchain etc & various other methods we're probably totally unaware of.\n\nIt further imprints into my brain the Scottism that 'ALL BELIEF IS EVIL'.",
