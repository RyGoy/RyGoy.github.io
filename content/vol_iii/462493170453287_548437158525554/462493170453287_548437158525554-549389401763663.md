   "message": "And now a short personal vignette:\n\nI was ordering food in a restaurant and the proprietor took it upon himself to point to a woman and mention that she brings in her little daughter frequently.  He said it was SO SAD that the little girl spent all her time focused on talking to, and feeding, a stuffed animal.  \"They're just not right in the head\", he said sadly.\n\nI looked at him and said, \"You're a religious man, aren't you?\"  He proclaimed that indeed he was.\n\nSo I asked him to consider that he was making derogatory comments about a little girl with a stuffed animal which actually existed, while he was an adult with an imaginary friend.\n\nIn case anyone's wondering how he reacted, he looked vaguely confused, walked into a corner and stood there.",
