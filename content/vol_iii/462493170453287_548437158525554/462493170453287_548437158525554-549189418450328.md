   "message": "\"Believe\" can turn even the \"smartest\" into quite dumb people. I myself am a BIG example. \n\nI came to this group as a \"believer\".  Once here, I heard Scott bashing \"christianity\" (and all other forms of belief, as Scott is an equal opportunity \"belief-bashing-machine\"), I started asking questions. Questions, that before, my brain wouldn't even dare going there. \n\nTHEN it all just came crumbling down. There were no logical/factual explanation for ANY of my questions, other than acknowledging that what Scott, Andrew, and many others said IS TRUE.\n\nI was miserable for quite some time afterwards. Very angry. Angry at myself. \n\nThe feeling of \"guilt\" that religion had planted in my brain, I HATED IT! I hated been \"good\", yet feeling I was always screwing-up to my imaginary sky-daddy. I had MANY years of complete misery. \n\nNow I CAN SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT, the feeling of NOT worrying about non-existent problems/rules is one of the greatest gifts I have received from Scott Duncan, and TTFL.\n\nTHIS IS AWESOME! :)",
