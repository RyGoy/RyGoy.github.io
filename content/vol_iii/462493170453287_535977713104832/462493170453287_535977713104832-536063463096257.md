   "message": "ChiefRock Sino General I see your point, however alot of what has gone on, we remained silent on because we had no idea about what was illiegal or unlawful, much less that there was difference between the two. We have learned the very hard way what the cost of remaining silent is. And trust me it does not happen any more in this house. I guess what I could do is another affiavit to community services, their lawyer and the staff sergeant and ask by what authority. Their silence will be my law. I have as yet to hear back from the 5 RCMP. CPS and their lawyer will not respond back as well to any matter that I have contacted them about so far.",
