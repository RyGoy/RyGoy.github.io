   "message": "Pete Daoust, you may think that it is honourable. But they don't. I tried to serve 5 RCMP officers here in Nova Scotia by registered mail and all were refused. I even tried to go in person to serve the defaulted affidavits and I was pretty much kicked out of the detachment. As a matter of fact I was told by the staff sergeant Perry that if I tried to serve the papers at the attachment again that \"I will personally sue you, not as Staff Sergeant Perry but as Tony Perry. Are you good with that? Get ready! Get Ready!\" Who is not being honorable now? I have to say that I'm just shaking in my boots. LOL Staff Sergeant Perry of the Anitgonish RCMP Detachment. I'm so ready.",
