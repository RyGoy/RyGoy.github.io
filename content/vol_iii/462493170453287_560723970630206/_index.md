   "message": "Just got off the phone with Bell.  Told them that Rogers offering a better deal and I will no longer need their services.  Told me you still have a contract with us and it doesn't expire for another 2 years and if I wanted to get out of the contract it would cost $635.  Told them I never signed a contract or gave them authority to autorenew the contract.  Agent said that they sent the renewal attached to an invoice and that I never responded to it, so I was in agreement to the auto renew.  I said I wouldn't be paying the bill, they said collection will be calling you everyday and we will ruin your credit rating.  Filed a complaint with https://www.ccts-cprst.ca/complaints/complaint-form and am waiting to hear from them.\nAnyone have any info on the autorenew aspect of this contract?\nThanks",
