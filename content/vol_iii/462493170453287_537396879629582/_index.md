   "message": "Trial today:willfully obstructing a peace officer.I refused to show ID or insurance at a TRAFFIC stop for snow on my bumper covering the license plate. This was my fifth appearance re this matter.Previously I had deposited my Live Birth Record and Notice of Mistake into the COURT file the latter they just ignored.Today I walked in with 9 of my friends and family in tow.Judge asks are you(name)?Thats my name I own it.Is anyone disputing that?Supernumerarry interrupts me,I cut him of cross my arms and firmly say Is anyone disputing that my name is my property?while looking him right in the eyes.No one is disputing that he says.On and for the record no one is disputing that my name is my property.Supernumerarry \"Ahhhh it seems that crown has double booked the same spot for you and xxxxx case.sometimes bla bla bla you could come back tomorrow see if we can get you in bla bla bla sign some papers reschedule bla bla bla how do you wish to proceed?Im thinking sign some papers,ya I'll get right on that.I look,the judge in the eye and say\"what does your internal procedure have to do with me? I don't understand what you are talking about.I want to settle this right here,right now so I can get back to my family and my job.I go on a little rant and tell him I'm not coming back.I turn around and walk out.Sherrif tries handing me a paper I ignore him.My friends ,family and I get out into the foyer and start jeering the two cops that arrested me.Sherrif comes out and tells me to leave the building Right Now.I ask him if he is going to put his hands on me he says yes.I tell him he does not have my consent to touch me,my dad says let's go ,so we go outside.The cops leave ,more heckling .
