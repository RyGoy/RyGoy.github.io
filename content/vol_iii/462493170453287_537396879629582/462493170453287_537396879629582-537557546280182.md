   "message": "I was just happy to get out of there unscathed .I totally agree Andrew it was in my mind to say dismiss this right now ,I knew it was the proper thing to say but I couldn't get my words out.I have no knowledge of the lien process,I understand the concept just not how to implement it. Beverly I think you are correct I have not heard the last of this.regarding claiming the name my thinking is this,it is my property it was given to me by my parents,I am surety for the name but I choose where and when to act as surety.I never really felt comfortable with my tactics ,I was double minded in my approach, a hack, but I have learned soooo much and really appreciate this group.",
