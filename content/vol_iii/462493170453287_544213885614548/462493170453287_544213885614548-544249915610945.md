   "message": "Listen. The trick to understanding the natural law is this: You have to really concentrate. Every song has a bridge, verse, and chorus. Three dementions. Like... past, future, and present... beginning, middle and end. And the key to understanding it all, is that when two immovable objects come into a collision course, one has to move the hell out of the way. Like in this one song : Elvis, the King, starts out leading this thing, in the first verse, then he begins to move to the background in the second verse. as he realizes by the time the last verse comes around, that JERRY LEE LEWIS can sing it better. This is the key to all knowledge.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J53Jdqsmc54",
