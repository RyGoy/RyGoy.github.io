On or about the same time, President Roosevelt, quietly through Congress claimed all property, both real and living, to be \"subordinate to the interest of government,\" effectively seizing elodial and equitable title (as distict from legal title) to all property, including the people themselves, so that the government might borrow there upon the same serving as surety and collateral, for loans from international bankers, in violation of the 10th and 13th Amendments (prohibiting slavery).\nRoosevelt's unlicensed lawyer and top economic ad-visor, Col. Edward Mandell House, in support of the plan for econmoic enslavement of the entire population has been quoted as saying : \"...[E]very American will be required to register their biological property in a National system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient (admiralty Maritime) system of pledging (themselves as contribution or tribute to government)... By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will affect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency. Every American will be forced to register (by birth certificate, social security card, and drivers licence) or suffer not being able to work and earn a living. They will be our chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions ( or presumed obligations in statutory jurisdiction in corperate courts). This will inevitably... leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call 'Social Insurance.' \"\n\nHOW SLAVES TO LEAGALITY ARE LAWLESSLY RULED\n\nArticle Three of the Constitution establishes the judiciary for the people, fully vested with their rights. Article One and Four establish the executive and legislative branch, which can create \"administrative courts,\" that mimic law courts with legality, legalese, and leagalism (religion teaches is black magic, witchraft and sophistry - or, the art of lying) to handle internal government affairs of employees and agents of government, who have no more rights than military personnel who have signed stewardship and ownership of themselves over to government, to be treated as \"wards\" you might say. All Article Three Courts, which are empowered to recognize your rights as a free citizen, have been entirely supplanted, and replaced since the Civil War and the Great Depresion, with Aticle One, and Article Four, Legislative or Executive branch administrative courts, all the way down to your local circuit, district, or municiple state court, and their operations have aditionally been Privatised, to create a role reversal between you and government, to treat you, the private person, as a public institution, subject to the legaleese of fictions, while the government operates as a private corperation, masquerading as a public institution. These courts cannot recognize the rights of a person not employed, or owned by government.\n\nThe general misconception is that any statute passed by legislators bearing the appearance of law constitutes the law of the land. A \"Statute\" is not a \"law,\" (Flournoy v. First Nat. Bank of Shreveport, 197 La. 1067, 3 So.2d 244, 248), and a concurrent or joint resolution of legislature is not \"a law,\" (Koenig v. Flynn, 258 N.Y. 292, 179 N.E. 705, 707; Ward v. State, 176 Okl. 368, 56 P.2d 136, 137; State ex rel. Todd v. Yelle, 7 Wash.2d 443, 110 P.2d 162, 165), Nor is 'Code' \"Law\" (In Re Self v Rhay, 61 Wn (2d) 261) these being defined by Black's Law Dictionary as rebuttable prima facie, or superficial, evidence of law, a facade, represented by 'public policy,' being color-able, or 'color of law,' being 'counterfeit or feigned' as defined. As the Supreme Court has warned, \"Because of what appear to be Lawful commands on the surface, many citizens, because of their respect for what appears to be law, are cunningly coerced into waiving their rights, due to ignorance.\" ( U.S. v. Minker, 350 U.S. 179, 187 ). The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and any inferior federal or state act, code, title or statute, derived from or predicated upon the original contract for government, to be valid, must be In agreement therewith. - 16 Am Jur 2d, Sec 177 late 2d, Sec 256.\n\nThe courts today operate on the presumption that you are owned by government, (chattle property) an 'asset', or 'human resource', an agent, representative, or employee, an 'office,' or 'department' of government, only by the birth certificate, and other 'Union' memberships they have created for you, a contract for slavery, that you never knowingly and intentionally signed, bearing your foot prints. Clever.\n\nThe act of registering a child contracted them as chattel, and the birth record was a deceptive legal way of getting the parents to sign the baby away. The birth record was in fact a promissory note that was converted into a slave bond, which was then sold to a private reserve bank effectively giving ownership of the child to the bank.\nEach new baby�s contract was sealed by either a drop of their blood or by an ink impression of their foot onto the birth record, as was done with paupers upon their death certificate probating their estate. This �signature� was used to create their lifetime value, evidenced by their labor and the taxes and costs of that labor as monetized currency � all designed to keep people in servitude for their entire lifetime.\nThe banks have been the modern slave owners and as the saying goes, �He who owns the debt owns the people.� The way the Slavery System was imposed on us meant that even if we did end up paying off our house or our car, we never actually owned it, because our right to any Real Property ownership was given away at the registration of our birth.\nThis has been legal process since 1540 via something called a Cestui Que (Vie) Trust, and this was still in effect until the recent UCC Rulings changed the legal landscape and reinstated the un-rebuttable fact that no-one, and no corperation or government, can own our �selves or own our bodies. The slavery system has remained intact for so long because of educational doctrines, the influence of our community at large and because so many people accepted and embraced their slavery by waiting for others to help them or to tell them what they should/could or should/could not do. Enforcers like the police and courts made sure we stayed within the slavery system and incarcerated us if we chose to live as FREE individuals.\nIn fact, the slavery system was imposed on us all (and maintained for centuries) by building walls in our minds through propaganda and conditioning, creating the false belief that we did not deserve better, that we were not part of a greater plan and that we should instead be happy with the handouts, crumbs and �indulgences� given to us by the Powers That Were (PTW), while the system itself reaped in millions of dollars every year, directly from the sweat and blood of our labor in bondage to the witchcraft of legalism as slaves.\n\nBut you can remove yourself from their corperate jurisdiction, or begin to at any rate. Memorize this, and you will avoid a lot of trouble, a lawyer taught me long ago. The court calls the case of the State v Me (You). \"Im here on that.\" You state. \"Are you this (so and so) person the Judge asks? \"NO (you must say)... \"The name was given to me, but I am not the name, and I refuse to plead not guilty, a negative that cant be proved, as I am innocent of any crime, and i do not consent to being judged or tried in any court except an Article III constitutional court of record for the protection of my life liberty and property rights, and if the person of the court pleads for me surety is transferred to that person in his private capacity for the national debt.\"\n\nThat \"Fiat Paper Currency\" Col edward Mandel House proclaimed would \"secure a chargeback\" for your slavery, is in fact forged or counterfeited money or value, and any demand for payment can be responded to as follows :\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF INABILITY TO PAY COST AND FEES\n\nAN UNREBUTTED AFFIDAVIT STANDS AS TRUTH IN COMMERCE\n\nBeing Duly deposed and Sworn, Affiant, autographed in Blue and sealed by thumb print in red ink below, states as follows:\nI can make no Payment on any debt or obligation to pay pursuant to costs, fees, any contract, settlement, or order of the court, until the form of payment is clarified and defined, considering the following :\nFACT ONE\nNeither paper currency nor deposits have value as commodities, as deposits are merely book entries, and it is still a Felony to tender these or any such substitute, electronically or otherwise for lawful money in many States today including Texas. As Texas criminal law states �All recognizances, bail bonds & undertakings of any kind, whereby a party becomes bound to pay money to the State, & all fines & forfeitures of a pecuniary character shall be collected in the lawful money [gold or silver, not legal tender federal Reserve Notes] of the United States only.� TEXAS Code of Criminal Procedure � 43.02. the Supreme Court has ruled that \"Lawful Money of the United States could only be gold & silver coin or that which by law is made its equivalent so as to be exchangeable therefor at par, & on demand, & does NOT include a currency which though nominally exchangeable for coin at its� face value, is not redeemable on demand.\" Bronson v. Rhodes, 74 U.S. 229, 247, 19 L. Ed.141. �Checks, drafts, money orders & bank notes are not lawful money of the United States.\" (State v. Mellon, 73 Pac. 321, 43 Ore. 168. Black�s Law Dictionary 6th Edition defines �Real money,� as; �Money which has real metallic, intrinsic value as distinguished from paper currency, checks & drafts.�\nFACT TWO\nNo state may make any thing but gold or silver coin tender in payment of debts (Article 1 sec 10, US Constitution), yet no payment in gold or silver may be demanded in payment of any debt or obligation because of government declared bankruptcy. ( HJR 192; Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111, and 6260, House Joint Resolution 192 of June 5, 1933; 31 USC 5112, 5119;12 USC 95a; confirmed in Perry v. U.S. 294 U.S. 330-381, 79 LEd 912 (1935)).\nFACT THREE\n\"The legal tender quality of paper money is only valuable for the purposes of dishonesty.\" (Knox v. Lee 79 U.S. 457 (1871) \" and By agreeing to pay fines, court costs, or any other obligation or debt in monetary exchange or commerce with any public institution by such means, weather or not being tricked or coerced by rogue government or any representative thereof into paying any debt, obligation, or fine, in anything other than gold or silver, one would be as such either pressured, intimidated, coerced and threatened or induced under duress, drawn into, or conspiring to engage in the crime of 'counterfeiting' and forgery, a felony, and so should and must respectfully decline and resist any pressure to accept any offer and reject, any inducement to be pressured or drawn into contributing, aiding and abetting, weather directly or indirectly, any manner of criminality, such as defined in and by law as 'forgery' and the 'counterfeiting' of money or value.\nFACT FOUR\n�No person shall ever be imprisoned for debt.� - Constitution of the State of Texas Art. 1 � 18, 1876. �No man can give that which he has not... [nor that which he can not be required to have, such as contraband Federal Reserve Bank Notes counterfeited as money].� (Jackson v. Bradford, 4 Wend. (N.Y.) 619). �Incarceration to coerce bond is unconstitutional.� (Pullman v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522 (1984))\nLET IT BE KNOWN TO ALL OF YOU through this Declaration, autographed in Blue and sealed by thumb print in red ink below, not induced by force or compelled by fear, but of our own good and spontaneous will and by the common counsel of our law, that we do not offer or freely concede to contracts being brought into existence by extortion, counterfeit or forgery, that Begin and End in fraud, the poison fruit of an accursed tree, whereas as our rights, liberties and regalia; all of which things, as they have been by us published to you, we wish to have perpetually valid and firm; and we bind ourselves and our successors not to act counter to them, by charter, fealty, demur, or concession.\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nI the undersigned and above named do hereby Certify that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was served upon opposing counsel by placing a true and correct copy of the same in the United States mail, all postage paid, or by my own hand, notice to agent being notice to principle, on this the day of the month, this the year of our Lord Two Thousand Thirteen A.D.\nATTESTED VERIFICATION\nIn Witness, Whereof, knowing the law of bearing false witness before God and Men, I solemnly affirm that I have read the foregoing and know the contents thereof to be true and correct to the best of my own knowledge except those matters which are therein stated based on my information or belief and as to those matters I believe them to be true and will testify to these in the legal or lawful court of any nation on earth before both Man and God so help me.\nDated this the ___________day of the ___________month, this the year of our Lord Two Thousand Thirteen A.D.\nWithout Prejudice\n\n__________________________________ All Rights Reserved\n\n__________________________________ Witness\n\n___________________________\n(Witness Name)",
