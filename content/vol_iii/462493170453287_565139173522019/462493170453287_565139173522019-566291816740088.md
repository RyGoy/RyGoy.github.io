   "message": "So please explain why the concerns i loosely framed above are unwarranted Adam ?? i've already told you were i am as regards the BoE & for you to repeatedly brow beat me without answering my questions is pure bollox mate. any further mentions of BoE without that is SPAM for me........ so here we go.... uimhir a h-aon 1) Since it is an Act, is it clubhouse rules? 2) what care they how you interpret it, you are not a card carrying member of their interpretation society? 3) Is the BoE in principle not just Mernards AFV by a different name?how is it different 4) By discharging & signing, Is that not evidence you are operating in their system, in their jurisdiction? I know everybody is caught up in the outcome of this & STICKING IT TO THE MAN but will that really be the outcome?. I'm here to learn FIRST/FOREMOST.  Is the use of BoE not contrary to the lesson here?  For me any benefit \"freely\" given by them will always be poisoned!! Which one of us is thinking Wrong & Valuing the Wrong things? If its me i want to fuckin know ..... so lets be fuckin havin ye ;)",
