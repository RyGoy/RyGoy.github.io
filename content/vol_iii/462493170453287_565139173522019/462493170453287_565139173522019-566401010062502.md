   "message": "It's another form of dependence, people think wrong why would you need to BOE if you had value ?, you're depriving the banking system of an amount of currency doesn't cut it for me simply because it's not or never was about the actual money involved. It's about enslaving you into being a worthless eater. Now whether that is done through money, boe , rocks or unicorn pubes the end result is the same you still have a master. If you are independent and can generate your own revenue however without any interaction with the club(because all interaction costs YOU) that leaves you with no master. So for that reason I can't stand behind BOE as a form of remedy, a stepping stone at best with a view to getting you from A to B but don't be fooling yourself into thinking it's the holy grail and if everybody started doing it tomorrow it would drive consumerism through the roof.",
