   "message": "Is Scott Duncan the only one to notice and question the 'ethical standards' of the 'profession'? The ethical standards of the legal profession have been evidenced throughout modern history. It is common enough to hear someone say that all lawyers are liars. It is conventional wisdom that tells us to not trust a lawyer. The profession itself is an amalgamation of the closed system truths which adherents profess. A closed system truth is not necessarily true outside of the system. The legal profession is the professing of fictions and the claimed label of the professional society is 'Law Society'. It is clearly not a Lawful Society. (Queen) Elizabeth Mountbatten (or Windsor?) promised to uphold the 'true profession' in the coronation ceremony of June 02, 1953. The 'true profession' is as false as the label 'Law Society'.",
