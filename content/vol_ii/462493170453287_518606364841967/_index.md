I'd forgotten about \"Woe Unto You Lawyers\"! Thank you for posting this!\n\nPete Daoust: Always the same process...they want me to sign them a blank check and give them $5k in advance, and when I ask them to sign me a letter stating that they engage themself to reveale in court EVERYTHING I will ask the to reveale....they all refused...Some of those I asked to sign my letter, dont even want to talk to me anymore...lol...I pushed the questioning a little further with 2 of them\nWhy you don�t want to sign this agreement with me ?\nAnswer: I CANT\n\nWhy Cant you ?\nAnswer: Because I cant.\n\nAnd then�How will you be able to represent me fairly then..?...at that point, very evasive talking and clearly they have no intent on representing ME....and cant tell me the thruth on their real job....representing the justice....not me....\n\nScott Duncan: Yes, but look at YOU! YOU didn't waste YOUR time, you had an experience that frustrated and confused you, and instead of just venting to people who agree with you while smoking outside a bar, YOU INVESTIGATED WHY! I cannot over-express the profound RESPECT I have for that. It's a very positive character trait, that few people have.\n\nScott Duncan: I just do what works. Or use the method with the highest success rate.\nI know not to waste time with people who give ME such labels, I need only prevent others from \"believing\" them.\n\nPeople who give me such labels, ALWAYS value the WRONG THINGS.\n\nScott Duncan: Maximus Legis, In what capacity are you attending?\n\nMaximus Legis: Special attorney in fact for a friends fiction.\n\nScott Duncan: ACTING DULY AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR (DuuH!)\n\nThis video is actually MANDATORY VIEWING for ALL lawyers before they are ALLOWED to become a member of the B.A.R.: http://www.metacafe.com/watch/5999248/60_minutes/?noFBRedirect=1#_=_",
