   "message": "Since Scott has pointed-out that government is a TRUST. Then WSIB, would be operating as an extension, of that TRUST. However, WSIB is an INSURANCE board. And as Dean Clifford has said, anytime you bring an INSURANCE company into the mix, you have automatically subjugated and/or subrogated (i forget which one exactly) your RIGHTS to another. You THINK WSIB will treat you as the BENEFICIARY of this TRUST, and THEY the TRUSTEE. But, i suspect what happens, is that it becomes the exact reverse. THEY become the BENEFICIARY, and YOU become DEEMED the TRUSTEE. A TRUSTEE is an EMPLOYEE. An EMPLOYEE is told what to do. Kinda like the way everybody says they are being spoken to/treated by WSIB- being TOLD what to do. Sound familiar?",
