   "message": "..from the WSIB-page i posted on here\n\nTRUE STORY!: Mr. and/or Mister and/or Ms., is a term of ADMIRALTY LAW, that refers to a subordinate. When you let WSIB get away with addressing you as that, you are CONSENTING to them addressing you as THEIR SUBJECT. SUBJECT = SLAVE.\n\n\"Dear WSIB,\n\nHi - how are you? And please by all means call me Michel- as my mother called me Michel, and as i understand it Mr./Mister is a term of Admiralty Law that refers to a subordinate as i neither LIVE on and/or over 'navigable waters.'\"\n\nLet me first just start-off by saying that i am writing this in good faith as i do not WISH to create controversy as i WISH to remain in peace-and-honour, and, in a NON-adverse manner.\n\n(start body of your letter/NOTICE here)\n\nBy: NON ASSUMPSIT, WITHOUT PREJUDICE, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED_____(your signature here)_____\nMichel Belisle, Grantor, Donee, sole-LIVING-Beneficiary-in-RIGHT, Lawful-Holder-In-Due-Course, de jure pro domino, NOT a body corporate, Creditor\n\n*DISCLAIMER: DO NOT use these terms for yourself until you have LEARNED what they mean everybody.....this is just what I WOULD USE, because I JUST KNOW ;)",
