   "message": "So Wendie, you'll notice, just above in my description of what WSIB is, that the admin of the page Scott \"Liked\" what i had to say. He does that often so he doesnt have to spend the whole day typing-out full-blown explanations to people. He will just confirm to save time if you were RIGHT in what you had to say, by clicking the \"Like\" button. Always check the \"Like\" buttons to see if Scott was one of those who clicked on it.",
