   "message": "Side note? \nIt IS all about accounting with them...literally.\n\nSo...if you DO owe them and have to pay....fuck them up. If your tax is like $200 lets say....send them a properly signed and documented money order...for $201. They will send you a check for the $1...which you dont ever cash...because cashing it completes their ACCOUNTING processes and nothing gets \"finalized\" til you cash that check, but still shows youve paid and done your end. This was especially useful when I used to get traffic tickets, and prevented loss of demeirt points (you know...that whole brainwashing bullshit where they have you thinking driving is a privilege, not a right, as it is). \nSo if/when you DO end up paying what you owe, mess them up by overpaying and dont cash the balancing check!",
