   "message": "i dont know what court you have but if the truth be nothing (as in you have nothing they could claim), it is illegal to force a person from being broke (but having a few things) to being a peon. PEONAGE http://blacks.worldfreemansociety.org/2/P/p0888.jpg and to note i did once find in Mass Law somthing to the affect of it being illegal. BUT them taking your lawnmower or other such property may NOT constitute peonage.",
