   "message": "The \"Stone of Destiny\" used for the Queen's inauguration was a fake. The original required, was removed. It is an integral part of the coronation. Sooo, she is not the Queen. Also, she violated her oath \"not to legislate\", per God's order, so, again, she is not the Queen. I figure that would make all BAR members, under her, powerless and acting in their capacity is fraud.",
