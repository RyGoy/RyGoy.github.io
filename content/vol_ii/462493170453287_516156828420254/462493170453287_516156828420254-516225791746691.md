   "message": "Yes, Blake, but here in reality, none of these things exist. None of you even know what money is, muchless how to fix it. Who are these imaginary people who will fill the roles to \"fix the system\"?\n\nI've been teaching the Noble Lie for DECADES, and I am here to say that NONE of thse imaginary \"qualified ethical\" people exist.\n\nThink I would participate? Not a chance! I'd wipe the lot of you out for being so stupid. I'm a bad choice. I will spend 2013 trying to wake up who I can, then I vanish and exploit the incumbent idiots.",
