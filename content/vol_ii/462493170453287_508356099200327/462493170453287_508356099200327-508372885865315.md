   "message": "What legitimacy is there to this scheme? Research into the matter has probed deeply enough to find that the entire scheme operates under commercial and maritime presumptions based on municipal corporation structures and authority over commercial entities. If and when State or Federal entity, including courts, issues a liability or executes a judgment, the subject, and defendant, is invariable a juristic or corporate entity, i.e., JOHN DOE rather than John Doe. John Doe is presumed to serve in a fiduciary capacity for the juristic JOHN DOE, and by way presumptions described as constructive trusts, is subject to both civil and criminal penalties.",
