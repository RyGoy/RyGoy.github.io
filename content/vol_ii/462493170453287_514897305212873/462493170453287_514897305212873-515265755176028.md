And all of you certainly\nneed me (or another competent lawyer willing to sacrifice his \"legal\" career) to properly handle this action.... We can [and will] win this, but to win a case of this scope and nature will\nnot be easy, fast, or inexpensive. Even as the sizable group we are, this will still be very much a 'David & Goliath' battle.\"",
