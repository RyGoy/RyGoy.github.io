   "message": "\"Laws are not \"written\" into existence. Rather, laws are discoveredï¿½in nature. To write them is only to acknowledge them. \n\nContrast this with legislation. Legislation CAN be written into existence. But legislation is not law. It is something different. Something lesser than law. Indeed, sometimes written legislation runs contrary to law. It is different in another way, too: in order for government-written legislation to be binding on an individual, the individual must consent to being governed. That consent must be voluntarily given. It cannot be coerced or forced or obtained fraudulently in any manner and still remain legitimate. If the individual does not consent, the legislation can have no binding effect on the individual.\n\nThe people need to realize that legislation is not law, and that the individual does not lose claim to the title of \"lawful citizen\" or \"law-abiding citizen\" if they choose to disregard legislation that they do not consent to.\n\nFor example: some people feel they must register their firearms if they want to be able to say with a straight face that they are a \"law-abiding gun owner\". But this is not true. They can ignore the patently unjust legislation, and still call themselves law-abiding citizens. It is only the criminally-corrupt government which will conflate law-breaking with legislation-breaking and try to label the gun owner a criminal.\"\n\n- Christopher Sanborn",
