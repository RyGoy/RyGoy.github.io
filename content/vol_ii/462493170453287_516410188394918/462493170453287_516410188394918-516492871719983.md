   "message": "\"Presumptions\"...can you give me a few key examples? And defining definitions is critical? What if they tell you that your ignorance of their definitions is not an excuse? Whose definitions matter? And...lose strength? (I asaume you're not saying that they possess wanton power? That the power of their definitions run unabated? Rrue, but ia THAT what youre saying? Loose/Lose...)\nEither it has atrength...ans validity, or it doesnt. Theres no varying degree! Its either valid or its not, it doeant decrease in validity or applicability....their preaumprions and definitions cant \"kinda sorta\" apply. They either do or don't. \n\nI hope my advocacy with Saitin  (metaphor for those ready to jump all stupid on my parables, analogies, and examples. Its not a literal comment, for those that love to get shit off track) proves constructive sparring. Train hard fight eaay right?",
