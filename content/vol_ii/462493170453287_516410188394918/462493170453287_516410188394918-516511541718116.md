   "message": "The government (corp) Does this with our consent. Once I take away my consent they lose jurisdiction. They cant deal with the LAWFUL MAN because they no longer have a contract with the person. Statues or nothing more then company by-laws. if I am no longer a company employee I don't fall under them. When I quit a job at lets say McDonald's can McDonald's come after me for going to work for burger king? No this is foolish and they would look foolish filling claim. Only by fear do they keep us thinking we have to stay on board, if we don't we will get into a lot of trouble. This is what the notice of mistake does it removes this presumption that we still work for them it end's the contract we was tricked into.",
