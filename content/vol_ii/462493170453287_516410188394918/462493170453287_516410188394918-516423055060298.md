   "message": "Is the state not a trustee of your human rights and fundamental freedoms?  Does that not make you a beneficiary of said rights and freedoms?   Did you not place your trust in your trustee, your trustee having far superior legal knowledge, not to take any action to induce you into any type of contract which would abrograte your human rights and freedoms absent your clearly knowingly and willingly agreeing to such abrogration?  Could your conduct now of relying upon a provision of an Act (contract), which I suspect you never knowingly and willingly agreed to enter into at the expense of your human rights and freedoms, not imply that you willingly and knowingly agreed to be bound by that statute?",
