   "message": "Here are the facts.  One, if you don't show up for court a warrant will be issued for your arrest will be issued.  Two, if you do show up, and you know how to deny jurisdiction, they will likely proceed with scheduling a trail regardless.  Three, the facts of the matter will largely determine their ability to properly gain jurisdiction regardless whether you subsequently deny it at court.  Four, if you do not show for that trial they will proceed in your absence and a warrant may very well be issued for your arrest.  So what do you do when the facts of the matter establish that your rights have been violated and they are proceeding against the person regardless?",
