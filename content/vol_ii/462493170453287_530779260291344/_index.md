   "message": "Since it's Friday, I shall end my week of theist-bashing, with a question asked of me in private. I don't mind answering legitimate questions from people SEEKING answers, and not declaring the already have them. That conflicts with reality. I already have the answers and imaginary friends conflict with those answers (reality). The discussion was compelling, but in the end they didn't want to \"be seen\" asking the questions in public.\n\nI get that.\n\nThere where two questions that stuck out as compelling, and I thought I would share them.\n\nThe first: What religion do you think is the \"wisest\"?\n\nThere was a bit of disclaiming preamble of understanding that adults with imaginary friends might not be a good foundation of which to build \"wisdom\", so I suspect she was looking for the \"best of the worst\" in my eyes. :D\n\nHinduism was my immediate reply.

Hot Girl-on-Girl action is as close to \"divinity\" that I have seen. If there is a god, he created Hot Girl-on-Girl action, just for me.\n\nIf you can declare the \"nation under God\" crap, I can declare that:\n\nHot Girl-on-Girl action, is a universal human right.\n\nIn the spirit of this, I give you:",
