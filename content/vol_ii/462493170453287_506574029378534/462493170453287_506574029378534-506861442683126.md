   "message": "Made up bullshit as opposed to the STANDARD bullshit of the \"Clubhouse rules\" and the relevant bullshit that cops believe, and pretty much ANYTHING I'm not discussing.\n\nI make the rules clear:\n\nNONE OF THIS IS HIDDEN, and the reason you cant see it and I am CONSTANTLY pointing out the OBVIOUS, is because none of you actually read what I write.\n\nMade up bullshit, is the \"new\" concept the eventual recipient of a ban invented.\n\nSeriously, this isn't Day of the Fucking Triffids. I Don't CARE if you are blind anymore. If you don't get it, it's because you love your programming and the idiotic things they produce... Like \"respecting\" that people who believe in imaginary friends from Jewish Mythology, actually BELIEVE such crap.\n\nYou read what I write (ACTUALLY read), and then you ask questions for clarification. THAT IS IT!\n\nYou do NOT make shit up. \nYou don't talk about your imaginary friend. \nYou do not make some shit up so it fits in with your \"belief\". \nYou don't do ANY of those things, because you will be made an example of.\n\nI think that's pretty clear.",
