   "message": "Scott Duncan: \"You know, when we fought Scott, we did it to save ourselves from extinction. But we never answered the question \"Why?\" Why are we as a people worth saving? We still commit murder because of greed and spite, jealousy, and we still visit all of our sins upon our children. We refuse to accept the responsibility for anything that we've done, like we did with Scott. We decided to play God, create life. And when that life turned against us, we comforted ourselves in the knowledge that it really wasn't our fault, not really. You cannot play God then wash your hands of the things that you've created. Sooner or later, the day comes when you can't hide from the things that you've done anymore.\" - ADAMA (Paraphrased with Search & Replace)",
