   "message": "Top of my head/out of the ass reasoning here...the valuable security is liened into trust (taking it out of the public domain & into the private), the lien has (face) value and the security serves as a form of collateral/secured debt (I think)...\n\nIf that reasoning is correct, then the trust may be equivalent to an account holding the security, so the valuable security could be marked in the books of the company as an asset held in trust (account), which would probably make it money of account with its face value being the amount you liened it for.\n\nYou can then 'use' this asset to acquire credit...\n\nI don't think I quite have the terminology correct, but my guess is that the lien can be treated as 'like money'/a negotiable instrument, which would make neither the valuable security nor the lien an account as such, but the trust may be considered an account.\n\nDamn it, there goes my relaxing evening...time to hit the books & learn how securities and liens are accounted for :P",
