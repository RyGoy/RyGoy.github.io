   "message": "So, I was in court on Wed, and I used the point of order, the Justice said they don't do the point of order.  I had filed the notice of mistake, he said he didn't understand or comprehend it.  I asked him to recuse himself, he wouldn't!  These fucking people are out of hand!!  So I sent him a notice of I am going to fucking lien your law licence!!  He will be in front of ME on Wed. I will see if he has changed his tune!!",
