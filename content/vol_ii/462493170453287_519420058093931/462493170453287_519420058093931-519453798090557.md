   "message": "@Joseph. I recently discovered that any document filed is placed 'face down' in the Magistrates file folder, the same goes for 'handing up to the bench' a file; it is presented and placed face down on the bench. Placing it 'face down', the magistrate can only see the blank side of the last page ... consequently, if the magistrate can't see anything, then it doesn't exist .... the sneaky, dirty, shit-faced fucking arse-holes.\nHowever, writing double-sided, overcomes that problem. Preferably, the NOTICE OF MISTAKE should only occupy 1 (one) page, using a smaller font if necessary. If there is an attachment, such as a Birth Certificate, have that printed both sides and witnessed by a JP or Notary Public. You then insert that in between the (two) 2 front pages. Consequently, it matters not which way the document is filed or presented as the Magistrate will see the front page.\nDoes that make sense?",
