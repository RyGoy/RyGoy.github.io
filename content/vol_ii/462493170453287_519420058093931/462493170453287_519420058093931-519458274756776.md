   "message": "yep exactly - double side all documents - though in what u said - when I filed my 'NOTICE OF UNDERSTANDING and DENIAL OF CONSENT\" with the district court in Manukau, Sth Auckland, I spoke to the then court manager and insisted that the documents be presented to the judge before the alleged case against the legal fiction was called - I insisted that the judge be given the opportunity to read it cos it would effect what the public got to hear if I went into legal argument about the documents - and I made sure that he understood if that happened I would make dam sure everyone in the courtroom knew the court was a sham and it had no jurisdiction over all those called that day or in the future - thats how important it was for the judge to read what I was filing with the court.....he said it was very unusual but he would try, I told him not to try but to do it or the shit would hit the fan and his not doing it would make him responsible for what the public got to learn about the legal system that day....the judge was 40mins late coming to the court and my name was suddenly called first when it wasn't supposed to be called for at least another hr or so.....So its NOT WHAT YOU DO - BUT HOW YOU DO IT that really counts....but DOUBLE SIDE ALL DOCUMENTS IS THE WAY TO GO, same when you get business cards printed - always ds them.",
