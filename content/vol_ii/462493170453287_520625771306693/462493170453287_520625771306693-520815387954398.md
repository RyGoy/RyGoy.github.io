   "message": "In any communication make it very clear...'I am a peaceful man, I am an honourable man, but right now I am a very afraid man.'   \n\nExplain very succinctly that you got a 'stay' on proceedings & for some reason, you feel that certain officers may have taken this personally.\n\nExplain that you were peacefully minding your own business when you were tackled by an officer who somehow perceived you as a threat.  Somehow a bag of weed (which may have been on the footpath) was assumed to have been in your possession.  Make it clear that you do not use weed & that you are willing to undergo hair analysis to demonstrate this fact.\n\nFighting words just make you a target, same with unfounded/unprovable accusations...send your concerns to the police station, senior officers & all the way up the tree to the minister...now if anything happens to you it looks very suspicious...treat your letters like a PR insurance policy.\n\nDemand a right of reply from the newspaper that reported on the incident...state facts & your fears...above all, keep your head...the media will provide the emotion.\n\nYou are more intelligent than these people...they are relying on you doing something stupid under pressure, so stay calm, think before you react & let your administrative process do the talking.\n\nAll the best mate :-)",
