   "message": "Since I'm in a believer-bashing mood, I also want to point out how much you all LIE about people who have no imaginary friend.\n\nSam Harris points out this ugly emerging trend. You \"believers\" know that you sound like idiots, and science is PROVING your idiots, so you \"believers\" resort to doing what you do best; Lying about prominent atheists.\n\nEventually we'll just round you up and eat your babies... that's what you \"believers\" think right?  Well whatever you think, I won't stand for it if your idiotic beliefs touch MY life.\n\nThat's the problem with believers; You really are all the same. You're programmed to be.\nThat's why I know what the result of this ugly trend will be.",

   "description": "Salon.com has published yet another article vilifying Christopher Hitchens and other prominent atheists:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/19srVfK\n\nThis is part of a trend:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/Hy03be\nhttp://bit.ly/16t39u0\nhttp://bit.ly/rYWbiV  \nhttp://bit.ly/QTgiGe\nhttp://bit.ly/UPgDz0\nhttp://bit.ly/13GOSN5\n\nI do not object to hard-hitting debate, but I do object to bad journalism and the malicious distortion of our views. \n\nAmong the many charges in the current attack on Hitch were are told:\n\n\"Nor did he take the trouble to learn about the secular Buddhism advocated by lay scholars like Stephen Batchelor, author of 'Confession of a Buddhist Atheist.'\" \n\nWhen in truth, Batchelor's book was among the last that Hitch ever blurbed:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/a3u1BK\n\nPersonally, I will have nothing to do with Salon in the future--and I recommend that atheists and secularists who care about rational discourse boycott the website.",
