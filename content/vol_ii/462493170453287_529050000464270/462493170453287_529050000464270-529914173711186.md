   "message": "No I'm tired of declarations that there IS \"something more intelligent than man\" with no evidence.\n\nI'm tired of delusional fuckwits declaring it's true without evidence, and declaring that I am somehow less because of their delusions.\n\nI'm tired of idiots LYING about people who don't share their delusions. Like this fuckwit, Marty Oneill declaring that I am having a \"tantrum\" because I don't like being lied about.\n\n...he, of course can feel a tingling sensation, followed, by \"BANNED\"!\n\nYou fucking theists are always lying. It's what you are and what you do. No lies in here...\n\n...ESPECIALLY ABOUT ME!\n\nHow's THAT for a \"tantrum\"? :D",
