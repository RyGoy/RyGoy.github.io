   "message": "So for those who can make it, Again round 3, MR Green is going into the Court, i feel this is one of his last times to do his verbal contracting correctly or affirm his status. So, 1pm North Vancouver Provincial Court house. I hope many of you can come as, they try to clear the room for this man, as they done last few times, it would be good if we can have many there to show a presence. Comment if you are able to come, men and ladies. Come witness contract law live and direct :P",
