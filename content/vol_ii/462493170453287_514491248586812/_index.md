   "message": "Here's something that might interest some of you. If you'd like to know how this system was created; why it was created, and how the foreign corporation known as the United States has attempted to enslave you, these are the four foundational issues that will answer your questions:\n\n1. Federal Reserve Act 1913\n2. The State of Emergency 1933\n3. Social Security Act 1935\n4. Alien Registration Act 1940 (where your birth certificate was brought into play)\n\nAnd the Lieber Code: Government rules for the military 1863.\n\nYou can listen to Rod Class explain it in this one hour Cliff Notes version if you feel so inclined to understand each step that led us to where we are today in the united States of America. This may be very similar in Canada as well, but I'm not as familiar with your laws and statutes.\n\nDirect mp3 link .... http://recordings.talkshoe.com/TC-48361/TS-739563.mp3 \n\nOr you can go to Rod's talkshoe page and scroll down to episode #723 on April 19, 2013.
