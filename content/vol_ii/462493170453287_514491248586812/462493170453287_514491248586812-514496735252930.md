   "message": "Yes, Rod covers the 14th a lot. He may speak of it in that episode, I can't remember. If not listen to a few of the shows before and after and he covers it.\n\nBeware: The 14th Amendment is not what enslaves us. That Amendment was to create another class of citizen for THEM; to separate them from us. It's not what everyone thinks it is, and Rod does a pretty good job of explaining this in his shows.\n\nWhat enslaves us (or attempts to) is the Federal Reserve Note, which we are not even authorized to use; it is an INTERNAL currency, meant only for THEM, but they've forced it on us.\n\nAnyone who takes an Oath of Office surrenders their American Nationality and becomes a Foreign Agent, Employee, Officer, Elected Official of the UNITED STATES.\n\nThe 14th Amendment is their \"give up my nationality card\", and has absolutely nothing to do with you and I, unless we want to become one of THEM ;)",
