   "message": "yep, but i bought retail goods, the first sentence is related to goods while being delivered to the retailer. your second sentance is relative to a vehicle, which the state does NOT TAKE the MSO, you GIVE IT TO THEM <keyword> volintarily [out of ignorance].\n\nmy friend just bought a trailer, shipped from Pensylvania came with the MSO, to the dealer and signed on the back delivered to the consumer, which IMHO is wrong and should not have the dealer's name on it as my friend is the retail purchaser. I bought a trailer from LOWE'S and they gave me the MSO (which I still have).\n\nhere we can just pretend to home made the trailer from spare parts and stock from the steel yard, and the plate can then be used pretty much on any trailer as long as it's under 3000#, but i've hauled 12 ton boats with plate. nothing is illegal until you get caught doing it.\n\nBUT lets get back to the original question as I will deny the statement's validity unless it can be qualified: what HIDDEN LIEN can be attached to the use of Federal Reserve debt Notes as a medium of exchange between parties, private OR public (retail).",
