   "message": "yea im here in Ann Arbor Michigan and female students are claiming rape and sexual assault all the time while in public lately (more common in dorms). The alleged attackers are never caught it seems, just google it, to me these attacks are possible because the women walk and jog around half naked all over so im sure some guys cant control their behavior, however, since nobody gets caught it looks like a feminist based ruse for these kind of dumb laws.",
