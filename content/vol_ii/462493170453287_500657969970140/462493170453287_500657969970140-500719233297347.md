   "message": "darn you and your common sense....well, if I have to let that go I will let it go...but not just yet.  what about the equitable compensation?  SCOTT?      and i have paid my dues and spent two years researching. so i do not apologize if people think I am looking for short cut answers,  my perspective is that a real live human child, many more than one, is sitting in a group home somewhere getting the shit beat out of him.  that child doesn't care how i get the info to help him/her.   I expect the gov. to be evasive and keep their knowledge hard to aquire.  I will look into correcting the record, thank you.",
