   "message": "ok, Brenda has some questions about your guys take on this, but I don't remember what they are.   she can ask later.   I made this document,  wasn't sure I wanted to admit that publicly, but oh well,   and This is NS point of view, but I think it still applies well everywhere in canada. this document is how I make sense of how cas can get away with so much obvious contradictions in law and jurisdictions....they are giving parents a penal sentence of sorts, but they do not have to use federal standards of proof to impose these restrictions of parental rights...they claim legal investigative powers that have no true legal standing.....The federal gov. allows provincial agencies that claim legal investigative powers to request individuals criminal records and the RCMP give them the records. well, if cas has legal investigative powers, why cant they lay charges? they have civil investigative powers and that is administrative law. the SPCA can't investigate or even take your dog unless it is a duly appointed special constable under the police act. so what gives. To me, the scam child protection is running has been to treat parents authority to protect their children from harm as if it were a gov. duty and that can be regulated. the cfsa proclaimed it in the preamble, we the gov. declare that parents and guardians have a responsibility to protect their childs rights. and if they don't we will step in with all authority we have given ourselves...???I am just rambling now.      http://nslegislature.ca/legc/statutes/childfam.htm",
