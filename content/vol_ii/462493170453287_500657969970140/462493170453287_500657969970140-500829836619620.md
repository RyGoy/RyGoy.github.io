There's some honesty for ya.     do you have any money at all?  who did you get it from.   honest to gosh,  I have leaned that the gov. owes me for the pleasure they have had screwing me, but don't bother trying to collect payment cause there is no such thing as money.   so lets not even worry about how/ process, what forms to use, you could use,  lets say,  if they had a secret ACCOUNT somewhere you didn't know about.",
