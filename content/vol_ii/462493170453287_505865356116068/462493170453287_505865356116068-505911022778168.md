   "message": "AN ABBREVIATED ACCOUNTING OF EVENTS:\n\n:My friend/s have been keeping an apartment in Toronto for over a decade, which they utilize on a part time basis (usually every week or every other week). They have younger FAMILY members living there on a full time basis, and as you can imagine, over the course of more than a decade, there have been numerous family members coming and going, as they get themselves situated or require help in this game of life. Most matriarchs and patriarchs have helped their family members in similar ways throughout history.\n\nMy friends spouse passed away about a year ago, and the applicant/s were very upset that the deceased was not the registered OCCUPANT of the rental unit, since then the applicant/s have proceeded to TARGET my friend. (i.e. Calling for meetings with �management� to discuss grown men bringing UN-opened cases of beer into the unit, threatening to tow family members vehicles, eggs and other food stuffs tossed onto vehicles, etc., etc...). I should mention that not a single complaint has EVER been brought against ANY member of this household.\n\nThe applicant/s impotent fury led them to making claim to the board that my friend had VACATED the unit and �TURNED OVER CONTROL� or �SUB-LET� without consent from the landlord. The applicant/s did not submit ANY evidence until today (which I predicted they would do weeks ago). The applicant/s produced a single photo-copied cheque with my friends alternate address highlighted, as PROOF of their claim.\n\nSo... I started things by having the �adjudicator� show some true colours by stating �GOOD MORNING *insert FIRST name*!�, and being such a down to earth character, the �adjudicator� stopped in her tracks and responded with �EXCUSE ME!, DO I KNOW YOU SIR?!� -->> Bartard fuming -->> CHECK! NOW, we let the applicant/s proceed to share THE SHIT THEY MADE UP and wave the photo-copied �PROOF� of VACATING around as if it were a shining beacon of truth.\n\nThe �adjudicator� seemed quite pleased with the applicant/s presents, and was quite intrigued with this photo-copied �PROOF� showcasing an alternate address, UNTIL we gifted her with OVER TEN YEARS of photo-copied cheques ALL with the EXACT SAME ADDRESS! -->> Bartards anger RE-DIRECTED, good times.",
