   "message": "Apply for a BIN number from the CRA or EIN number from the IRS. Should be a good discussion for later.\nEnjoy\nThe last time I e-�-mailed Eldon about his method he did not know about a T5008 or how to use them? He told me to try my own methods and was not interested in discussing it.\nMost do not understand that you have to apply for a BIN number to make it work. That number ties the Living human as a labor for the strawman.\nThe human has expenses to pass along to the strawman for just living.\nWith out the BIN number you have no connection between the two identities and therefore the CRA can not see them as employee working for the employer. The government issues the T5 for benefits paid to you from your SIN trust Account because you asked for a dividend payment as a beneficiary. A T4 is for earned income only. You are issued a T5 for bank interest over $50.00 ,this is not a one way street. You are to issue a T5 to\nthe bank for interest payments (dividends) for a loan but you have to use your BIN number to do this.\nAm I correct in my assumption that...\nSIN (employee) = Registered & controlled by the Crown in right of Canada BIN (employer)= Registered & controlled by man\\woman in their own right???\nYES Somebody is starting to see the picture. Congratulations MAGPIE369 SIN= lower caps name register as employee\nBIN= UPPER CAPS NAME Register as employer\nEverything is simpler than you think and yet more complex than you imagine. You asked for freedom, you now have the knowledge on how to receive freedom from the world of commerce. How you conduct your business\nusing the BIN is by your own due diligence. If you cannot handle freedom then do not register and let the nanny in charge of the SIN number look after you. One has to be careful of what they ask for. You are now on your own!\nI do not understand what you mean �How do I verify the BIN�. The BIN is applied for the same as a SIN number. The SIN number is for the living man to receive benefits from the feds. You are to APPLY for a BIN number to survive in the world of commerce. You apply for one of these when you turn 18. You have to notify the CRA that you want to use your strawman name. If you do not they will only see the SIN being used and you are liable for its use as a beneficiary. The corporation (yours) is already set up now apply to use it and all of its benefits. This is a simple corporate merger. You can apply for the BIN via internet , phone or by mail. I suggest downloading a copy to read and understand the application. Phone if you\n32\ndo not understand.\nThe BIN number is the get out of corporate slavery jail free card! Do you want to be a corporate slave for all of your life? After you receive your BIN\nnumber, order T7DR vouchers with your BIN number on them, to pay your bills. You have to think like you are running a business. The SIN number belongs to the feds and is their property; you cannot order them what to\ndo. Can a slave order its master what to do? Become the master of your\nown affairs.\nPeace and enjoy\nHave fun playing!\nTaken from MASTER TRUST CONVERSATION",
