   "message": "I see the most important problem we have, us the older guys, is that we are HAVING a hard time following instructions....we THINK we may know something, we mix the ego with this, we THINK we are tuff enough and we fuck things up....I realize that when someone I found give me INSTRUCTIONS on something I know fuck all about, that I should shut up, and STOP trying to find answers from some other sources, and become sooooo fucked-up that I will do WORST than when I knew nothing...Plus, I see people in here taking instructions From Dean Clifford, and from Scott Duncan. I think this is NOT right, I think I have to choose beetween the two....I either follow Scott's instructions, or Dean's instructions....that's my 2 fucking cents on it....in semi-english and semi-french language :D",
