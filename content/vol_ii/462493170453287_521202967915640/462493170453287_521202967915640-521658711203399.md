   "message": "Should I get mad if a monkey throws a banana at me, while at the zoo? Should I get mad if a parrot calls me a name, while in \"Parrot Jungle\"? There is plenty of reasons why many monkeys, and parrots, are behind bars. \n\nPerhaps, you should transfer your case here, to Puerto Rico. There is plenty of space at the zoo here, and we sure love monkeys... A LOT! Then, I could bail you out with bananas, and rice. We can repeat this over, and over. When I get tired of this, I'll sell you to a chinese restaurant, to turn you over into a delicious Poo Poo Platter.\n\nYou don't need an ID, or driver license here. Monkeys have the right to travel, so don't worry. Monkeys are protected by the Monkeytution, the Supreme Law of the Apes. And remember, whoever holds the banana, is surety! Pass that shit around.",
