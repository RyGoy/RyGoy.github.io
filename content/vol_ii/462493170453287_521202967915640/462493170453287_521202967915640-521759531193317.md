   "message": "Philip, I've gained NOTHING on this exchange. I am/was honestly trying to help you, and Dean out. You have court in June and October. To me, insults can only come from people that have VALUE to ME. If not, then I call anything else a JOKE. I am on YOUR side, I gave/reminded you an idea/advice that I know has some kind of VALUE, and can help you. I see it's futile.\n\nIn exchange, you want to turn this into a \"who's-got-the-bigger-balls\" challenge, just because I am NOT politically correct. Your EGO wont let you see past your eyelashes.\n\nNow I can understand Scott when he says he wants to kill us all. I don't have to suck-up to ANYBODY, Scott included, but I do respect, and VALUE peoples' time and effort, including MINE. I will point you to the following post, as a reminder of what I am talking about. https://www.facebook.com/roguesupport/posts/10152550522890471\n\nBut, by your own admission, you LIKE jail. If fact, you prescribed jail as \"fun\". <<Jail is fun anyway, really, spent nine months in once, one of the best experiences of my life!! Everyone should try it once anyway ...>> Dean liked your comment, as well. Hurray! You have a cellmate!\n\nRegardless, I still wish you, and Dean, good luck on your cases/charges. You should listen to Pierre's advise. THE TENDER FOR LAW is a place for TOUGH LOVE. Man-up, or get out!",
