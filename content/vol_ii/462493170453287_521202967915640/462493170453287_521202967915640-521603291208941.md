   "message": "I do not think anyone has all the answers, at least we are trying, that is better than doing nothing at all. Scott has not said one thing to me in regards to anything I have done.  As far as Dean Kory goes, his method of remedy is fully acceptable.  It may take many tries to find a perfect solution.  The justices in my area are arrogant and do not listen to anything.  They are afraid of me however and are sending in out of town crown and justices for my case.  Are you suggesting that I just do not show up for court?  I can do that, but I assure you they will put out a warrant for me and I will end up right where I started! Perhaps you have missed what I have said.  They refuse to acknowledge the Notice of Mistake and point of order!  After I posted that information, followers of this page did offer some suggestions that I can use.  As Scott has said you are in their house, so their rules.  I do not like this a bit, but I feel as I am making some headway. If you have any better suggestions please let me know, I am open to any and all advice.",
