   "message": "Scott's \"Dean Kory\" thread, and Derek's consolidation of \"notice of mistake, and point of order\" threads, seem to be the best and simplest (easiest to understand) pieces for us (me anyway) to retain... the hardest part is properly holding \"them\" to answer to the questions presented within the notice of mistake...I've recently witnessed them denying to acknowledge it, (the crown took it glanced at it and tossed it back at her, the judge wanted no part of it whatsoever)...not that it wouldn't have worked, so much as it was not properly put to them, and therefore: \"FAILURE TO APPEAR, DEEMED TO... PLEA GUILTY?  or something to that effect, I was too far back to hear the exact wording...we were threatened with arrest for \"contempt of court\" for not standing when \"ordered\" the sign out front says \"please stand\" \"please\" must be defined as \"fuckin do it\" in one of the many definition sections, lol I asked if that would be a civil or criminal, one guy said ask a lawyer, and the cop said criminal, I asked where/who is the injured party, he said there doesn't have to be one, and on the way out he was just to busy to elaborate any further, lol",
