   "message": "Doing my first one today.  You can place the lien first it is an imperfect lien, then you need a court order to collect. I have watched videos where in the U.S. they are telling cops, judges etc. to put their property in their spouses names.  Even with an imperfect lien they cannot remove it, so if they want to continue working (if you lien their bond or licence) they have to pay.  If Dean is going to follow through with a lien, then this method is fine.  I prefer the other way, lien first, invoice later!",
