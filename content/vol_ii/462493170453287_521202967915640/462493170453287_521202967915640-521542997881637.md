   "message": "I am new to this so....someone on this page just said lien the charges, no talk of invoices, statements etc.  I suspect it is the same as a lien on the warrant. Scott Duncan had mentioned  that, what is the process, do you have to sent a statement etc., for that.  My name is on the charges so I am a party to it.  I think it is different than putting a lien on someones else's property.  I am willing to try these things and not afraid to make a mistake.",
