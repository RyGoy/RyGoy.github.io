   "message": "I have never used a notary in the cases I have used the NOTICE OF MISTAKE. I have ALWAYS followed ALL of Scott's instructions/suggestions.\n\nBut in the case of our ungrateful friend Philip, I suggested the use of the NOTICE OF MISTAKE in form of an affidavit, and affidavits of witnesses as \"friends of the court,\"making the court aware of the mistake, because of the level of alleged corruption in that county/district. That should itself create a fatal flaw in THEIR procedures. \n\nBut, if Philip does not understand WHY is that he can do this, then it wont matter, because they will KNOW he does not have a clue of what's happening, and that he is just \"pulling shit from the Internet\".",
