   "message": "Blake Gardner I put a lien on my charges yesterday, without the due process.  I guess we will have to see what happens. Due process of law, do those people even know what that means? I am certain I am the only person that could do it in this instance as no other PERSON is involved, only the Ministry. As I said it is an imperfect lien, you must have a court order to collect make it perfect. To get the order I would guess you have to go through the due process of law. It is my first, live and learn.",
