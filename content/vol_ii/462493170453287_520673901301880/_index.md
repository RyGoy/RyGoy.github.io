   "message": "We send men and woman to fight the terrorists. We put our men and woman in danger for the cause of freedom. We drop bombs, torture, and assassinate to ensure that freedom can be brought to the entire world so that the terrorist, which so very much hate our freedoms will fail, yet; we brand those at home who want freedom as the greatest terrorist threat to our country. Hmm? GO FIGURE!!!! Does anyone sense a snake that speaks out of both sides of it's mouth? When did lies become legal? Who wants to talk about the COLOUR OF LAW?",
