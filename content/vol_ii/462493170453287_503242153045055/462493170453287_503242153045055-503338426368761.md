   "message": "As i understand it the \"state\" is just an enforcement/administration agency. I believe the councils were crown created, Dublin City Council for example was created by fee simple title in 1539, nothing that happened after that interfered with its commercial activities. They issue driving licences, collect taxes tolls, rates for business etc. The council area's are jurisdiction areas, they are also outside the jurisdiction of the state, no case to answer. Judgments against councils for human rights breaches are paid ex gratia.",
