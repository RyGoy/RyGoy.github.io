   "message": "Without form there's no substance. There's just the impression that you don't care about what you say, and that you can be ignored for the ignorance-celebrating dolt that you are.\n\nIf you write like an 8 year-old, people see the writing of an 8 year old. When was the last time you looked for substance in the writings of an 8 year-old? Even if there was any to be could you dedicate the effort to suffer through the bad form... you just wouldn't bother.\n\nDon't celebrate ineptitude and sloppiness. That's what they want.",
