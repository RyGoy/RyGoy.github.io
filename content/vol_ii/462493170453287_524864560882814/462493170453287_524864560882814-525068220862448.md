   "message": "The OP was ï¿½When Scott says\"....so the statement is from Scott's direction. Beverly is asking what we thinks he means when he says it. Above is my answer to the OP.\nSorry, I can't get mobile FB to copy FB names. Most likely I have yet to learn how.\nPete your slipping, what happened to the usual statement of who you are.?\nConversation? Good conversation or bad conversation? A comment on topic or off topic? How about a random statement just thrown in?\n\nPLEASE clarify what you mean by getting a conversation going with everyone in context to the OP..............:/ .",
