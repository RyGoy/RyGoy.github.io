   "message": "Hey....Pete Daoust, it is not that I think you are wrong in what you say. It IS that I think that a member has asked us individually to tell the board what we each think Scott Duncan means when he says a phrase. (See OP)\nWe might even be right, only Scott Duncan knows. It is a good question the OP brings up, as Scott repeats that phrase many times and with vigour too I might add.\n\nONLY Scott Duncan knows the answer. (Can you read Scott Duncan's mind?) No, I did not think so. We can spout crap for the next 20 years and in the end as to the OP it really is just our opinions UNTIL Scott \"TELLS\" us what he means when he says that phrase. To think otherwise is to be foolish.\nI love leading you on, you made me win a bet.\nThe OP is not about what you can convince others of but rather your own opinion of a specified matter.\nPete Daoust! You are right! Nothing I have heard from you is wrong!\nThe above might be true I DO NOT KNOW! Most of the time I do not know what you are talking about, or even if it pertains to the OP! You want to be heard, I can understand that. Continue to be heard.\nTick.....Tick.....Tick",
