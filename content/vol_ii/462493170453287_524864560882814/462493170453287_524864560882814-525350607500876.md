   "message": "Now Scott can tell us or.......not tell us resulting in us thinking about it and by doing so it opens our minds to further learning and inquiry.\nNow back to the OP, We where asked what \"WE\" think Scott means. If you read the OP it is not being asked what \"Scott actually means\".\nTo be very blunt and in your face, We are being asked for our opinion to something that can never be verified without Scott speaking up.\nBut Scott was never asked in the OP as to what he means by what he says.\n\nNuff said.",
