   "message": "The MOST important, and VALUABLE information I have gained from TTFL Group is precisely realizing I \" think wrong and value the wrong things\". Which I would also read/analyze backwards: I value the wrong things, therefore, I think wrong. \n\nWe were programmed with a really crappy software that assigns value to the incorrect information, and subtracts, and/or even nullifies value from certain information. That's why things are \"hidden at plain sight\", and we can't see.\n\nBELIEF is an application for that program  (with the crappy software) that dictates HOW is that we are to process, and/or assign value the information given.\n\nThank you for turning my life into constant misery, Scott Duncan.\n\nPS: Excellent post, Beverly.
