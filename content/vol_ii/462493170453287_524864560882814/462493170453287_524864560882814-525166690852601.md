   "message": "I physically can not use an axe, chainsaw I can handle. So I get my heat from the chainsaw yet will never see heat produced from the axe.\nThe is of no value to me, the chainsaw has value to me BUT only while I'm using it otherwise it just sits there doing nothing. Now if, IF I rent out my chainsaw while I am not using it the the chainsaw has value in and of it self. \n(How many people are watching this laughing away while drinking eating and getting Mary?)",
