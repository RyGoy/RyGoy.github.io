   "message": "Yes, that's why I have a chair \"Rail\" around my place.\nThey get every thing provided for them and more. They have the Right to leave anytime they want or Stay as they choose. They have a virtual Boarding Pass 24 hours a day. The Galley is open 24/7. The Head is kept clean for their enjoyment and use. The Decks are kept clean and clutter free.\nThey have all their \"Bills\" taken care of from the ships account. They are Given Disbursements as can be afforded for their own personal use.\nThe First Officer is cute and fuckable and even performs her other duties very well.\nThe passengers are happy and content with the Accommodations and Direction of the course set. \nEvery one aboard is doing what they want except for me. As the Captain of this ship I am responsible for the Health, Happiness and Welfare of every one aboard.\nSince I hold Value in the people aboard I ACTUALLY am doing what I Want to do.\n\nTaking care of Business.\n\nThanks for asking.\n:)",
