   "message": "THE BANKS ARE NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK.\n\nTHE BANKS ALWAYS TRY TO CATCH YOU WITH THEIR RULES AND REGULATIONS. IF YOU BREAK ONE OF THEIR RULES THEY ARE QUICK TO COME AFTER YOU AND POINT OUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO TRANSGRESS. THIS VIDEO BELOW WILL HELP YOU SEE THAT THE BANKS ALSO HAVE BROKEN THEIR OWN RULES , BUT THEY DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW. THE RULES THEY BROKE WILL PRODUCE FREEDOM FOR YOU FROM YOUR DEBT ACCOUNTS. WATCH TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY DID WRONG ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN PLAY BOOKS.\n\nThey are operating with electronic accounts and creating money through the computer by hitting some keys on a keyboard. Watch the below video to see that banks create money out of thin air and then try to obligate you to THEIR CREATION.\n\nBank Act\nBills of Exchange Act\nFinancial Administration Act\nAll the information shared here on this page and all other pages on this website are for your own personal growth and information. My work should not be copied and used in a commercial capacity without my express consent. All those who engage in such actions have been placed on public notice.\n\nThere are so many myths out there concerning the commercial system and the structure of the banks. The number of opinions out there are vast and the majority of them make no sense at all. For example there is a man teaching that you must forgive your debts then you will escape the liability. This understanding is taken from a bible passage and has no force of effect in the real commercial world. It is sad to see those who teach such falsehood.\n\nWhen you went into the bank and opened up an account you agreed to many terms and conditions or at least the bank claims you did. Below are some of the terms and conditions that you agreed to. You will see that they are claiming that by agreeing with them you have bound you heirs to these terms and conditions.\n\n",
