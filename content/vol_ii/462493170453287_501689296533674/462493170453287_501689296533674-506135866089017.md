   "message": "Maximiliano Pï¿½rez, the Notice of Mistake should deal with the issue of surety, then the writ would deal with instructing the court how you wish to proceed/dismiss the case.  The praecipe from the judge then orders it so.  It's my understanding that a motion grants jurisdiction by making a request, which in turn recognises the court's authority...that's my take on it.",
