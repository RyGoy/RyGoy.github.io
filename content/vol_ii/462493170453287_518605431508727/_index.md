The Crown is trying to portray her as a victim and that she is in fear for her safety! you be the judge!...everything she is yelling at me is a lie meant to get me into a fight with the other men who live in the rooming house where this took place,it worked because i was attacked by a man with an axe handle only moments after she left! Who's the victim again?",
