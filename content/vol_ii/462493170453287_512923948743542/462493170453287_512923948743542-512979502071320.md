   "message": "Scott...In response to 1:  Thank you and this motivation is exactly the same as my reason for being here and learning legal babble from you and with you and others.  2:  I am quite qualified to make such clinical observations because, in that area of expertise,  I've done much more than you, know much more than you and see things that are of great value to all concerned here.  You ignore this aspect of philosophy, psychology, spirituality at fatal risk to your goals and standing.  My main purpose and contribution here will specialize in the 'mental health' diagnosies and defenses against those who do what I just 'played'.     Your flavour of banter and style of presentation when talking to your 'friends' is of the same manner that I use when educating the fools on my 'home turf'.   I seek to 'endear' myself to you with obvious 'tongue firmly in cheek' and clever wit of inventive verbal  humour.  If you don't want to play like this then fine.   You wanna kick me off your boat for insubordination?",
