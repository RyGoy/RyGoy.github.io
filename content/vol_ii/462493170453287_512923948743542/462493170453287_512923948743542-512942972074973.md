   "message": "Dear Scott;  I am still grateful for your creation that I borrowed.  I offered therapy and advice concerning your 'hungry ghost syndrome' and gave an introductory lesson as exchange for use of that ...shall we say...prophylactic document.   I see that my 'friend' offer remains unaccepted.  Good.  It's not appropriate if you are considering therapy.   I have no wish to judge Max Hardcore's work...(it may be (b)anal)...but this pirate and accumulation fetish is something you are disguising as a 'legal rights' issue claiming pirate jurisdiction.  I've seen this before, but usually the sufferer is claiming there is 'nothing wrong with porn'.  You are not making that claim and I personally love to jerk off to specific flavours of porn.  But to download means to accumulate and hoard.  This is a dyfunctional psycho-social illness as described in the newly revised DSM 5....\"Pornocopya''.",
