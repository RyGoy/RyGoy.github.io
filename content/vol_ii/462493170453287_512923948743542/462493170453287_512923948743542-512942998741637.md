   "message": "So...they are gonna tell my neighbors if I pirate porn? But if Im not illegally distributing it, or doing any of my definitions above...but just WATCHING PORN...what then? They gonna invesgigate me, my friends and anyone within range of.my wi fi? And then say oops you were just watching not pirating, our bad? \n\nAs for armies....is there a war going on I dont know about? Have I been determibed to be beligerent...esp if I decide to watch porn? Because if they did all that shit against me because they suspected I \"pirated porn\" they would be declaring war....on me. And if thats the case, then all bets are off. Im at war, that they declared.on me, and, as such, being a sovereign (since they declared war on me I must be, riiiight? )... I might as well rape pillage and plunder away!  (All of which, incl porn, aint my thing...hypothetics, but hey... lol)\n\nAlas...its all well and good we keep pointing out and identifhing the litany of lies, deceprion, bullshit and control and collering of the sheeple...but when are we gonna stop talking and statt DOING.\nCuz the shit ia getting deep",
