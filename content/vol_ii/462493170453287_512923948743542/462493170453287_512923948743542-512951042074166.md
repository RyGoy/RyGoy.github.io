   "message": "Rainhard Pitschke, while I'm sure you got all that psychobabble from some professional name-caller, and you think you are using \"science\" to \"diagnose\" some sort of \"fault\", you should know that following before you attempt to make a clinical diagnosis:\n\n1: I'm not doing it for any other reason than the fact some stranger says I shouldn't.\n\n2: You aren't qualified to even grasp the outer edges of what motivates me. I have DONE more than you. I KNOW more than you and I do not consider ANYTHING from unqualified sources and anything but white noise.\n\nCiting the babblings of professional name-callers is NOT the way to endear yourself to anyone running THIS forum.\n\n...oh, and I ignore most \"friend\" requests. Accepting such a thing would diminish those who actually EARNED the title of \"friend\".",
