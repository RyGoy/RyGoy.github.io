   "message": "In my case, I have been sending letters to the cops, crowns and justices promising liens!  They are simple to do, but I have yet do place one.  I would rather not and be able to defend myself in court.  Like you I am just learning.  I know they are nervous about me in court and have brought in out of town crowns ( I call them clowns in my letters) and justices.  I may proceed with liens, it seems like a nice way the generate extra income!!",
