   "message": "Terrorism Etymonline.com terrorism (n.) \n1795, in specific sense of \"government intimidation during the Reign of Terror in France\" (1793-July 1794), from French terrorisme (1798), from Latin terror (see terror).\nIf the basis of a popular government in peacetime is virtue, its basis in a time of revolution is virtue and terror -- virtue, without which terror would be barbaric; and terror, without which virtue would be impotent. [Robespierre, speech in French National Convention, 1794]\nGeneral sense of \"systematic use of terror as a policy\" is first recorded in English 1798. At one time, a word for a certain kind of mass-destruction terrorism was dynamitism (1883); and during World War I frightfulness (translating German Schrecklichkeit) was used in Britain for \"deliberate policy of terrorizing enemy non-combatants.\"",
