   "message": "One of my FAVORITE moment of THE TENDER FOR LAW :D\n\n\"I do not understand the charges, your Honour\"\n\"Why don't you understand?\"\n\"I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings\"\n\"What don't you understand\"? (This is where they expose themselves)\n\nNOW you go for the throat...\n\n\"Who's the injured party\"? (This one fucks them up)\n\"Is this a commercial transaction\"? (if yes, then say that you do not consent and waive the benefit... then THIS gem: \"If the court was lead to believe that I was a surety in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE. Please forgive me\".)\n\nIt gets easier once you understand that THEY ARE ONLY SEEKING SURETY, and the rest is just \"busy work\".\n\n:D",
