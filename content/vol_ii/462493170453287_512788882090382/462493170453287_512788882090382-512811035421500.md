   "message": "Just in case we want to get really fucking nasty. We don't know about Canada, but we assume it to be similar to Australia here, the judiciary and cops swear an oath to HRM QE2, however, since Aust and its States have become corporatised, these officers of the crown and state now [also] have an allegiance to a foreign power, the US; consequently, that could well be an act of Treason.\nThe fraud is about them trying to hang someone else's offences on ourself ...capitis deminutio... like the NOTICE OF MISTAKE clearly explains. An act to defraud us of our liberty, freedom and property.",
