   "message": "Hi Colin - situation is same here in NZ, approx 18yrs ago helped a friend to lay charges of treason against the then NZ government, when they got wind of what was about to happen , (was all to do with the BNZ sell off), in the early hrs of the morning a bill was passed in parliament (when hardly anyone was present) which changed the penalty from a death sentence for treason to merely a fine with no imprisonment possible. NZ is just as corrupt as any other corporation any where power and money are obtainable, John Key (his supporters? call him donkey) has just done a deal with a SKYCITY Casino here in Auckland to build a convention centre, \"con\" being the operative word, tax payers have been shafted in the name of money, funny that.Oh yea, I ain't a tax payer, haven't been since 2004, when decided to take on the Inland Revenue dept about the legality of their stealing income tax from employees, threatened to lay charges against them for theft, fraud, deceitful practice and manslaughter, why manslaughter cos I told them they had stolen peoples property, businesses, futures etc and thus some have committed suicide - which makes IRD complicit to causing their deaths hence I deem them guilty of manslaughter, you should have heard him yell down the phone \"u can't do that\" I responded \"oh can't I, push me hard enough and find out\" i made one or two other threats as well but this is long enough for now, ---- SCOTT, and ALL the other contributors of this FB page - A BIG THANKS for what you all do - fucken good to know there are other intelligent species out there, they are few and far between here in NZ, just a pack of deaf and don't wanna know sheeple.....in the coming years WE WILL ALL NEED TO UNITE the battle is just beginning.",
