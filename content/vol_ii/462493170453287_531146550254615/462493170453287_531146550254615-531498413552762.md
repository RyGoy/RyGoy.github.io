   "message": "I'm going to post a section of a private conversation that took place, oh, about the same time Kate made her original post - apologies for making the private public, but I don't want to retype the same basic thing.\n\nNot paraphrased, it goes exactly like this:\n\n\"On another note, welcome to the world of posting interesting and relevant commentary. If history has shown me anything, you will now need to post-sit for a while and drive the point home.\n\nA large number of people will \"like\" the comment and think it is meaningful and relevant. Some of those same people will heed your advice for 10-15 minutes, and eventually it will devolve into conversations with [edit: people] posting bad videos, talking about their throbbing erections, and squabbling about the direction of the post.\n\nEnjoy!\"",
