   "message": "I'm not a big fan of arguments.  Discussions maybe, but I never find arguments are productive.  My personal life involves people with uber-alpha personalities who rarely, if ever, have arguments.\n\nWe're all human (presumably), and it is human nature to take things personally.  The problem with doing this is that you tend to be less effective in your interactions.\n\nObservations are good.  Questions are great, if they're relevant.  It's even fine to have fun - I'm also a big fan of this, otherwise, why do anything?\n\nKate is right in that people whose retarded comments are ignored will either think of something more productive to say, or wander off eventually.\n\nDon't worry too much about making a comment or asking for clarification just because you think it may have been covered elsewhere.  If you ask the same question 15 times, however, it may be time to think about finding a hobby that doesn't involve deep thought.",
