   "message": "Pete Daoust, just another tip here on how to learn from reading posts. When I print out a great topic that has over 500 posts I redact all the posts by certain members. It shortens the useless reading which takes time otherwise. Sometimes I redact mine too, as they make no sense to the OP and why re-read shit I posted myself. \nOnly problem is the black ink cartridge just does not last like it used too.",
