   "message": "We're wasting a valuable fuel (and porn) source here so let me just say this.\n\nThe best web site disclaimer I ever saw was, \"By entering this web site you agree not to sue me for any reason.\"\n\nPerhaps another choice in telling people to stop pissing on the threads (see how I worked this in?) is to request that they only make comments that add to the discussion and/or don't piss everyone off.\n\nI have often thought a play area for people who take things personally, or who can't stay on topic, would be a great idea; sort of like the short-bus thread to practice social interaction before going off into the adult area.\n\nThanks, Kate, for reiterating a good point.",
