   "message": "So.....that's why you never leave an endorsement blank. Huh. Thanks Chad. If I am getting this garble de gook correctly, the other party has the chance to fill in whatever he/she wants and unless you rebut it, you have to \"pay\" or fulfill the \"bill of exchange\".  So if one receives an endorsed piece of paper from some one, can they technically claim they have a bill of exchange if they sign and file their request on said paper? I am retarded in this area so please anyone jump all over me if I am wrong.",
