   "message": "Basics for Idiots by an Idiot\nWhat 2 points best assist learning an Act (The core points)?\n\nI have noticed that there are few main posters and many lurkers here. This is a good thing. To much crap floating around just stinks. From questions raised in every OP I see commenters stray from the basics of the OP.\nThis is my method of approaching something I do not understand. Maybe others may post theirs as it may help others.\nI pick 2 points only, no matter how large the document. I have been going over the Bills of Exchange Act.\nPOINT 1 \"\"Bills of Exchange Act\"\" (The title it self speaks volumes) many long hours have been invested into those 4 words. Fantastic learning!\nPOINT 2 \"\"Section 30\"\"\nPerfecting bill\n\n30. Where a simple signature on a blank paper is delivered by the signer in order that it may be converted into a bill, it operates, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as an authority to fill it up as a complete bill for any amount, using the signature for that of the drawer or acceptor, or an endorser, and, in like manner, when a bill is wanting in any material particular, the person in possession of it has, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the authority to fill up the omission in any way he thinks fit.\n\nThe point of a method such as this is that if the above is always used when reading this act there is always a base to referance to. To help stay on track so to speak.\nI use the above 2 points since I see the Entire act as having;\n1) Everything is an Exchange of some nature and,\n2) Every thing in this act starts from Just a signature and nothing else. \nSo when ever studying portions of this act I always start with the above 2 items as a base.\n\nDoes anyone else use 'tricks' like this to help learn and what are they if you want to share.\nRipping things apart is always fun as long as you have a referance.",
