   "message": "Sect 92, Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900/1901, clearly states that we have free use of the roads and waterways. However, if roads/waterways used for commercial activity, then the operator of the vehicle requires a licence and, in so doing, the operator becomes a 'driver'. The Motor Traffic Acts knows it cannot enforce a driving licence onto a private individual; that's why you do not have one, but a commercial licence in it's stead. Just compare the name on your Registration of Birth (not birth certificate) with the name shown on the issued Commercial Licence, they are not the same ... look very carefully.\nBTW: The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900/1901 was never repealed by a referendum, consequently, it remains in force.",
