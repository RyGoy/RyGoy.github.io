Charge 2 times the rate for fiat currency, and make people BUY BITCOINS.\n\nYou can hire ME for one BTC per hour.\nPaying CA$H will cost you $300 per hour (Actually a very good market rate), but if you buy Bitcoin and pay me with that, it's 1/3rd the price (approx.)\n\nJust make Bitcoin too much of a bargain to refuse!",
