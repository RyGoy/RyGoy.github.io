   "message": "So Scott, as it is my understanding that when we pay a debt with a debt (cheque, online payment) it creates more debt. As they now hold our cheques and do not return them, they borrow (however many times the amount) and hold and/or sell them as securities, correct? How then would accepting a remittance coupon (as a money order) not do the same thing, being a creation of \"money\"? Is this because the \"paying account\" is not our private \"signature\" anymore and thus doesn't get borrowed from, thus \"discharge\" debt? ï¿½Additionally this also is the idea of thinking right and valuing the right things?",
