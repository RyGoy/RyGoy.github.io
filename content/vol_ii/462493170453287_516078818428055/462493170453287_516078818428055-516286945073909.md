   "message": "Accept...not except. I get you Dean, but using correct wording HERE AND NOW will save you alot of fuckery later, esp if youre gonna dance with judges about definitions. Start with making sure you write precisely what you mean bro. \nWho is the \"person\"? Where is the harmed party? How did you fail to \"appear\"...not with just what Scott said...if you were \"there\"? At worst you failed to identify yourself...in a way they wanted. I cant find the code for that one. I mean, do people have to produce I.d. at court? \nAnd yeah....what did you \"take\" physically? Who sis you deprive of what? Ia a court a private place or a public one of the People? Did you infringe someones copyright? \nAnd id tell them to fuck off with their disclosure...\"accept\" nothing!",
