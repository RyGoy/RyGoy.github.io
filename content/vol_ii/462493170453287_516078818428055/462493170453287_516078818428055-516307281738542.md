   "message": "I still cant get past they used the term 'UNLAWFULLY,' as opposed to what i would've expected them to use, 'ILLEGALY.' UNLAWFULLY implies to me that they are acting under common LAW, yet, they cite a LEGAL Act-and-statute. There's a MAXIM-of-LAW somewhere in the back of Black's 9th that effectively says: \"Those who contradict themselves must NOT be heard.\" Even the Sergeant in 'TV Man and Police' knows: \"Lawful is common law, and Legal are acts-and-statutes.\"",
