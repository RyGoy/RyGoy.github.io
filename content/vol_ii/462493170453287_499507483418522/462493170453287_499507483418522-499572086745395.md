   "message": "Actually its the same shit , this individual who is a good friend of mine was going the same  sovereign/freeman route.He had all his documentation ready has been looking for full disclosure of the contracts for 3 years now. He was railroaded in court and unlawfully inprisoned. He also reminded the judge of his oath of office and tried to involke his human rights but to no avail !! He is the first here to challenge the court here in waterford and has been doing it for a few years now, really pising them off . since the tourettes judge video appeared on the net the irish court services have been shaken badly and are now lashing back, hence the result in limerick. The crown dont like being questioned or challenged. As i said the whip is out now !!",
