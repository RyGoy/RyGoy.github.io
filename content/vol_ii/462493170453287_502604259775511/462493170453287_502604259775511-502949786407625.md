   "message": "If You Have Financial Problems\n\n    COMMUNICATE with the BUSINESS or landlord and TRY to work through your problem. Creditors may be willing to discuss how to manage repayment and avoid repossession or eviction.\n    If you simply cannot pay what you owe, it may be better to surrender the article and avoid the costs associated with repossession.\n    Credit counsellors can help you find solutions to debt problems and work with creditors to solve repayment issues. The Ontario Association of Credit Counselling Services can help you contact your nearest credit counselling service.",
