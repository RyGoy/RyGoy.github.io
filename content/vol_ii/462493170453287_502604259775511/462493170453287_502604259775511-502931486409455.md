   "message": "I don't believe there is anything you can \"say\" to a baliff at the door to stop him.  He is going to go ahead and do what he came to do.  I suggest having a well drafted document ready for him which will rebut his presumptions and assert your position at law respecting the matter.  What you will do is largely create evidence so as to show he acted unlawfully and is now liable to you.",
