If there is no signature, then it is a STATEMENT or a NOTICE, begging the question \"by what authority\".\n\n..now what about in the case of where there IS a SIGNATURE, but, 'the law' has still been MISAPPLIED/applied inappropriately and/or improperly, how does that change things with 'calling bullshit' THEN?\n\nScott Duncan: The signature is the surety (Authority) behind the bullshit. If you do not ACCEPT that authority, the onus is on the SURETY backing the bullshit in question, to demonstrate \"higher\" authority.",
