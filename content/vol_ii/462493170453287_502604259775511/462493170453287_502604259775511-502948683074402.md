   "message": "Quick Tips On the Role and Rights of the Bailiff\n\nPrivate bailiffs are appointed under the Bailiffs Act and are not employees of the government or of the courts, nor are they peace officers.\n\nBailiffs may sell repossessed goods in order to recover money owed to their clients.\n\nBailiffs charge debtors for their costs � the money is taken from the funds received when goods are sold or you may be required to pay the amount before getting the goods back. The bailiffs� costs are subject to those allowed by the Costs of Distress Act or the Repair and Storage Liens Act.\n\nBailiffs may evict commercial tenants and manage a commercial property or unit on behalf of the landlord. If a commercial tenant is evicted, the tenancy is ended although the landlord may allow the tenant to regain possession upon payment of the arrears.\n\nhttp://www.sse.gov.on.ca/mcs/en/Pages/Personal_Finance_Bailiffs_Role.aspx",
