   "message": "Scott Duncan Not really. When a contract has been fundamentally breached, you can set the terms of remedy. My part of the contract was to do the job and keep my mouth shut. I've done that.\n\nTHEIR part of the contract was to leave me and my trustees ALONE. NO \"LEGAL\" processes where ANY of us are surety.\n\nNow the public record has been altered.\n\nI have a VERY clear conscience regarding this. ALL parties who contract me are bound by the terms which CLEARLY claims my rights to do this.",
