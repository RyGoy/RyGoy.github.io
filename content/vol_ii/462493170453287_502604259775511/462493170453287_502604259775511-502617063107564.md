   "message": "6. Municipal Tax Sale Proceeding\n\nOnce all other collection efforts are exhausted, and the City has been unable to secure payment of the tax arrears, or a firm, suitable repayment plan, the City commences Municipal Tax Sale Proceedings as prescribed by the City of Toronto Act, 2006.\n\nMunicipal Tax Sale proceedings can begin once taxes have been in arrears for at least three years. The first step in the Municipal Tax Sale process requires the City to register a Tax Arrears Certificate on title of a property.\n\nThe debtor has one year from the date of registration of a Tax Arrears Certificate on title of the property to pay the cancellation price (which includes all of the taxes levied and outstanding, all accrued penalty/interest and costs).\n\nFailing payment within that year, or the entering into of an extension agreement, the Treasurer is required to proceed with a sale of the property through a public auction or public tender.",
