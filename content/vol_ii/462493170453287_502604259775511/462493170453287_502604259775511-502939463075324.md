   "message": "\"Unfortunately, nowadays, no one seems to know what a Bailiff does.  Often, this works to our benefit because debtors DONT REALLY KNOW what we can or cannot do, so THEY USUALLY err on the side of caution and COOPERATE WITH US.\n\nIronically, �Public bailiffs� cannot be hired by the public. Only �private Bailiffs� can.  If an individual person or business wants to enforce their rights of seizure and sale based upon a lien or other security, they can only retain a �PRIVATE� Bailiff to do it for them.\n\nA �PRIVATE Bailiff� CANNOT act on enforcing a Judgment, unless the Judgment or the RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE specifically entitles them to.\"\n\nhttp://laingparent.com/?page_id=102",
