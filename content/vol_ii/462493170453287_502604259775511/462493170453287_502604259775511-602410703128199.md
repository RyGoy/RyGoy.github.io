   "message": "Derek Moran *lightbulb-goes-off* \"When a contract has been fundamentally breached, you can set the terms of remedy.\"...... interesting. Using that same logic, lets take the City of Toronto's Charter of Expectations, basically a run-down of THEM stating how they will act as our public-servants and treat the rest of us. HOWEVER, if they are in BREACH of their OWN Charter, then, WE too can set our own terms for the REMEDY??\n\nhttp://www.toronto.ca/employment/life_tps/values.htm\nToronto Public Service Charter of Expectations and Values\nwww.toronto.ca\nCity of Toronto Public Service employee values\n\nScott Duncan Unless they can prove that there was no breach. If they rebut your notice, then the onus is on you to PROVE a breach.\n\nDerek Moran Fucking-eh, Scott Duncan..thank you, thank you very much for that NUGGET.",
