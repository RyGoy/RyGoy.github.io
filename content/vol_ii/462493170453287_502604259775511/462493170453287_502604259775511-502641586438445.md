   "message": "No. This is about a by-law violation about 2 years ago they charged my dad with while i was living in Windsor. When i came back last year, for Dean Clifford's seminar last March incidentally, they had already sent him SECOND NOTICE. I told my dad, that- \"You may not wanna pay it, because you feel its not fair-or-right, but you just cant IGNORE it either. You will have been DEEMED to be in DISHONOUR and to have CONSENTED to their claim by your ACQUIESENCE through TACIT-AGREEMENT to it.\" He asked me what was the alternative then? I said, \"Send them back your OWN Notice, asking them for their PROOF-OF-CLAIM that you've SUPPOSEDLY broken the law!\"",
