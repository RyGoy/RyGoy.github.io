   "message": "Your Rights When Dealing With Bailiffs\n\nBailiffs may not use force to repossess goods or evict commercial tenants. Bailiffs must withdraw if you tell them to do so.\n\nIf a bailiff uses threats, coercion or force, report it to the police and complain to the Consumer Protection Branch.\n\nThe statute under which the bailiff is acting controls the amount you are liable to pay for costs associated with a repossession or seizure. Your liability will vary according to the statute. You should refer to the statute to determine your liability and how you can challenge the costs.\n\nGoods purchased on an installment plan cannot be repossessed without a court order if you have paid two-thirds or more of the payment obligation.",
