   "message": "LaNi, every commonwealth state/province, as far as I can tell, is referred to as 'The Crown in Right of (insert corporate entity attempting to cause you harm here)'...Manitoba, New South Wales etc etc, (check it on Dun & Bradstreet www.dnb.com so depending on where you are, that will depend on the corporate entity attempting to drag you into their jurisdiction.\n\nThe 'Crown Attorney' who is attempting to contract/coerce you is an agent for the corporation...their details, if not on the 'charge' should be easy enough to look up, so send them the 'NOTICE OF MISTAKE' registered mail prior to trial, send another to the court, get a receipt for it and/or send it registered mail.\n\nAfter all, you are trying to make peace with your brother and correct a mistake, before it ever gets to court, which is the honourable thing to do ;-)",
