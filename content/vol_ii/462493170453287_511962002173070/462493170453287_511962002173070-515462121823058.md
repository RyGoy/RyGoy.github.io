   "message": "A \"new\" copy implies theres an \"old\" copy...I have no old cooy. A new copy costs $35, your FIRST copy costs $25. They would be charging me the $25.\n\nWhen I went to get a NEW copy of \"my\" SIN (my second one Issued) they asked for a bc to verify my I.d. I said I dont have one and at first the woman said my \"document\" (my b r ) was no good... I insisted it was and she looked it uo with her boss...and heo it was. My photo I.d. I was using ...was my release papers from jail that they give you. Of all the so called I.d. ive owned, my federal parole card was by far the best ine to pull out on people.\n\nInteresting to nite that in my caae, none of the I.d. I do have has my full correct name. Is this a bug deal? Yeah....like when I was beld in jail for SIXTEEN DAYS before they checked middle names and DOB's and realized I was the wrong guy.\nMaybe ive been someone who REALLY doesnt exist at all!",
