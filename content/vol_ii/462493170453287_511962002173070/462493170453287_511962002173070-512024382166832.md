   "message": "Maybe just a couple of witnesses and a notary?\n\nBIRTH CERTIFICATE = BILL OF LADING\n \nParents were the GRANTOR (one of the parties that created the bill of lading).\n\nYOU ARE THE CARRIER!\n\nA Truck ACTING AS CARRIER is NOT \"120,000 RonCo Turnip Twaddlers\"!\nIT IS, IN FACT, A CARRIER THAT HAS \"120,000 RonCo Turnip Twaddlers\"!\nIt's delivering it to YOU (The Beneficiary). It just hasn't arrived yet. \nYou don't know that YOU own the CARGO. If you OWN the cargo you are transporting you are no longer in commerce. You are transporting PROPERTY.\nThe NAME is the CARGO, and the BIRTH CERTIFICATE is the BILL OF LADING. It's valueless on it's own. Hence the term \"Sold a bill of goods\".\n\nWith a lien you are letting the world know that the cargo is in fact YOURS. Nobody has the right to presume your cargo is for commerce now. That is ALL a Lien is.",
