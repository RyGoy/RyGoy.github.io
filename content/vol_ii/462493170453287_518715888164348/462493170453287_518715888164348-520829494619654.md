   "message": "How long shall I suffer.?  I say no more will I consent to my slave masters. I will not waste any more of my time in fear. I will look at my self and know this day I am a man. I will make plans to protect what I value to the best of my ability.  I realize my suffering is caused by my attachment too things I once valued wrongly. and it was my wrong thinking that lead me down this path. I take this oath to myself and only to myself. Too never value the wrong things again and to not have false pride in thinking I know it all. I also will give freely of this knowledge to any that seek it in truth. Sincerely your's John wade Frisbey.",
