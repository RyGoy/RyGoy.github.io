   "message": ". . .. \"THE TENDER FOR LAW, is all about that mysterious phrase, �THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER�. . . . TENDER FOR LAW that contains the ACTS and STATUTES! THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER is a TENDER FOR LAW. If you BENEFIT, then you have OBLIGATION! . . . . you have ONE unalienable RIGHT; THE RIGHT NOT TO CONTRACT. . . . . . . . . �I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS�. If they ignore your question, then your next response should be, �OBJECTION. If the court cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.� Keep repeating that, and repeating that, and repeating that...until they answer your fucking question.. . . . . . Here is my court room position in a nutshell.\nYou do not accept surety � EVER. Step 1: Reserve all rights. (get Derek Moran to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)\nStep 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed. Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS. If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. . . . . the court will not allow the presumption that you being a novice is a lawful excuse. The only method to extract yourself �with honour� is to accept responsibility for the mistake in presumption. They are presuming something wrong...and you are acknowledging it's your fault. The court must accept this MISTAKE, and your entreaty for forgiveness for the unintended debt created. The court MUST do this.\nYour name should never come into it. Your name is but a piece of evidence in a much larger presumption that the court has the right to attach a name derived from a public document, to a living man.\" - Scott Duncan - December 3, 2014",
