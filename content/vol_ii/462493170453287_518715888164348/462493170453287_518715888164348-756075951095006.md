   "message": "I really enjoyed re-reading this. I've been in this group for 2 years. Every time I go back, and read something the Admiral wrote months, or even 2 years ago, I get to understand things that I simply could not see the last time I read it. The words where there, but I could not see/understand. Which scares the shit out of me, because that's when I remember what is the \"Dunning-Kruger Effect.\"\n\nI cannot imagine being new to this group, and grasping most of these stuff. Reading the Admiral's works it's something I have taken extreme pleasure in doing. Enjoy the \"one-way trip\"!",
