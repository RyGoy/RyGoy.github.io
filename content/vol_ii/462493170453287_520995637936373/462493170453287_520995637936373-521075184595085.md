   "message": "K - I sent the NOTICE OF UNDERSTANDING AND INTENT PLUS DENIAL OF CONSENT - Notarized by a JP, to the man acting as prime minister of nz, solicitor general of nz, attorney general of nz, head of nz police, head of Auckland police, filed it at the district court where they were inviting me too attend and made sure the judge got to read it before I decided to appear. Then in court I sat at back of court, when judge entered refused to stand  and when name called yelled out \"that sounds like my name\" ........when asked to stand replied from back of court...I will stand your honour on condition I do not waive my commonlaw rights nor do I consent to In-persona jurisdiction, the judge said \"oh stand up then\" then I walked to front of the public gallery not entering the bridge of the ship and told them the name on the summons was not my name - it was the identity of a legal fiction created by government - my name was as on my birth cert in upper lower case, as I held it up for them to see,  he replied  \"are you sure you aren't that person - no! your honour I am not, I replied, he then issued an arrest warrant for the all caps name for failing to appear in court .......then cancelled it after I turned around and walked out.",
