They may have only been exposed to that I've option. So their ignorance is not due to a cognizant \"choice\". Then there are those that the OP target: those that are aware of both option A and B, but CHOOSE to ignore or not consider option B because all they have known is option A. They are aware that there is more out there than one option, but, for a myriad or reasons, elect to stick to that one option even though they know there's more than just that. And these are the foolish ones...for they are conditioned....slaves...sheeple...who want to stay that,was and choose to remain ignorant to anything that isn't  option A and goes against their conditioning",
