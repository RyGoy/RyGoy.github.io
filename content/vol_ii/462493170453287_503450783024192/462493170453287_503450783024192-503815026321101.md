   "message": "Joseph Pierre Gillies, one can choose to be ignorant. On another site I have pointed out to people on that site about the birth certificate, and that there are other options available but you have to choose to teach yourself and learn for yourself. I gave them some hints as to videos to watch and people to look up. All I got from one is that she prays every night, and that leaving it in His hands DCS will crumble shortly. How can you fight that kind of logic? I'm not religious, but I'm not against whatever anyone else wants to believe. If that is what floats your boat, but I know that it takes more than that. They choose to do nothing, even though they could try and investigate for themselves. They choose to be ignorant. For many sheeple it is a choice. But there is a difference in people that don't know that there is something else out there and people that choose to not inform themselves.",
