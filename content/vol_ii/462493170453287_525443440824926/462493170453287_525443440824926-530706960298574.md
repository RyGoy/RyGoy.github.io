   "message": "They didn't even ask me for my name! The Crown asked if they could address Kathryn Butler's matter next as she saw I was there. I walked up and started to prepare everything and the Clerk paged my ex husband. The Crown stated that he had declined to attend, meaning there was no valid claim from a living man, no signed complaint and no charging instrument. We sent several documents which let them know that I was aware of these egregious errors. They paged him once, probably hoping he would show, and then asked for immediate dismissal.",
