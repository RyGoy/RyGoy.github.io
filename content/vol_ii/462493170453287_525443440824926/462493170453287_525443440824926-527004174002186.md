But Judge Thomas is sitting on the bench laughing to himself thinking- \"This ORDER i just issued actually is an INCHOATE INSTRUMENT. But none of these dumb-mutherfuckers in this courtroom knows that, let alone probably knows what an Order IS, let alone knows WHY the Order i just issued is INCHOATE...\"\n\nSO, Judge Thomas. . . .what is it exactly about the Order that you just issued, that still makes it an INCHOATE INSTRUMENT?",
