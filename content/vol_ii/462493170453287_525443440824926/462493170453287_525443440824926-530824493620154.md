   "message": "They gave me the Disclosure at the bail heating. The top page listed a bunch of conditions on it and stated that \"by accepting this disclosure, you agree to the following...\". At the bottom, it CLEARLY states that \"if you do NOT accept these conditions, you should immediately return atoll these materials to the Crown and arrange for disclosure in another manner or seek an order of a Court of Competent Jurisdiction.\" And the Office of the Crown's address below, so we mailed the fucker back with a Notice of Mistake stapled to the front. Next appearance, the Crown tried to hand it to me WITH my Notice of Mistake still attached :D \n\nStapling it on makes it PART of the document now.",
