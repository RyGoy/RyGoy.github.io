   "message": "What if you draw a Bill of Exchange which is to be drawn upon Pete as the Drawee (means he is the one to pay the party to whom payment is order) and present it to me insisting that I AM Pete absent any evidence for such a claim.  In fact, I expressly advise you that I AM not Pete.  But you continue and present the Bill to me then run away. Is that not fraudulent conduct by you as the drawer of the Bill?  What does the BoE Act say about who is liable when acceptance of the Bill is refused? What does it say about fraud?",
