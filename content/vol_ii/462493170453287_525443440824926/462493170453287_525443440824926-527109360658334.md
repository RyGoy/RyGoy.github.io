   "message": "For example. Most corporations are fairly uninterested with most of our procedures until it reaches court and even then they feel they are superior and to a degree untouchable...you can lien once you have first perfected a claim via the administrative process, but the real impact if that lien may not be so much the pay out if you can wrangle the monetization if your security but the reporting of it to Dunn and Bradstreet...that can stuff a corporations credit rating up and their insurance premiums making them a willing candidate for negotiating a compensatory settlement:-)",
