   "message": "Exception, Judge Thomas! At no point did Derek Hill call AND/OR imply you were a dumb kunt. He simply questioned whether or not you were \"bullshitting.\" You have made a FALSE CLAIM Judge Thomas, you are familiar with the RULES of RECUSAL? Derek Hill is entitled to remedy. Perhaps a detailed walk-through for the courtroom on your skill in this area would be enough to discharge/settle this matter? ;)",
