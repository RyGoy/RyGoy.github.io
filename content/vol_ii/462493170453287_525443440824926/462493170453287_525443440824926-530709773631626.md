   "message": "I had previously submitted an AFFIDAVIT OF STATUS, and NOTICE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE COURT which I required answers to in order to proceed, and gave them ten days to respond. When they didn't, I served a NOTICE OF FAULT AND OPPORTUNITY TO CURE, with an additional five days to respond. When that time elapsed, I served a NOTICE OF DEFAULT AND CERTIFICATE OF NON-RESPONSE (attaching ALL previous submissions to each new document as EXHIBITS).",
