   "message": "Is there any sort of time limit for amending these Negotiable Instruments? I didn't get a chance to use the \"Bag-O-Stamps\" in this instance, BUT, I just happen to have this envelope FULL of ORDERS received in the past, say about 5 years ago. A WEAPONS PROHIBITION ORDER (They just LOVE to slap you with that one whenever they can sneak it in),  a CONDITIONAL SENTENCE ORDER, an ORDER AUTHORIZING THE TAKING OF BODILY SUBSTANCES FOR FORENSIC DNA ANALYSIS (Seriously, NOT happy about that one), and not one, but two PROBATION ORDERS.",
