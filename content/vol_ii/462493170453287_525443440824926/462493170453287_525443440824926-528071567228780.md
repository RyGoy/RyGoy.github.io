   "message": "I must strongly affirm, protest & object. Your Honour ( kunt).\nThe prosecution has just labelled me a TAXPAYER.Whether or not that I AM a taxpayer is the very root issue in this case & has not yet been proven by the prosecution. I respectfully request that the W O R D   'TAXPAYER' be stricken from the record & that the prosecution be instructed to not use that word again until it has proven that I am indeed a taxpayer....fuck you very much your fuckheadedness...",
