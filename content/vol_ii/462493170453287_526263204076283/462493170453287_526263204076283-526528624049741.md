   "message": "\"And whereas it is just...\"\n\n\"Just\" is the effect of justice. The Justinian Codex was completed in 534 A.D. and furthered the ideology of inequality between plebeians and patricians set out in the Laws of the Twelve Tables from 450 B.C.\n Everything written after the term 'just' is irrelevant except to those who believe any one man or woman or group thereof has higher status over any other man or woman or group thereof. Justice is little more than legislated excuses to violate The Law. Nature has established a system of inequality which predates our existence and which will exist long after our extinction. There has never been a need for Justice, it is The Law that is needed.",
