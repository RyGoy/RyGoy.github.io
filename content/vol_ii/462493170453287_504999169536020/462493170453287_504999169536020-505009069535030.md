   "message": "lol at JPG\nStill, its easy to get exuberant...when your reminiscing about kicking a cops ass. Speaking of both...I was fucked up once, high as a kite and already out on bail for attempted murder..and kicked the shit out of 14 cops who showed up at my door for a \"noise complaint\" (the tenant who lived above me...was asleep at the time of this \"noise complaint\")...and green double barrels make you see EVERYTHING...so I noticed that 8 were CADETS...and they were trying to fuck with me...so I destroyed them.\n\nThen there was the time I choked a cop out cold at this place that was called Tailgate Charlies...and when I went to court for four charges...I self counseled and beat ALL charges, and when the crown thought I fucked myself by calling myself to the stand (making my previously unseen violence-riddled record admissible now), but turned around and had my record entered as an exhibit...to validate my claim of being an \"expert\" in street fighting.\n\nSo yeah...its a BUZZ when you think back to kicking cops asses in!",
