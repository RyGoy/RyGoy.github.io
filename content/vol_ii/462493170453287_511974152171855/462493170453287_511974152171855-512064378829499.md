   "message": "@shawn.....I had quite a shock when I got my bc from Germany.  It showed a different man as my father.  I'm 63 so this is a shock to 4 children of mine and grandchildren now too.  The entire thing now in my opinion is fraudulent.  I got validation from my mother (it was a real relief for her) and I did research to find that my birth father died but I now have two sisters I didn't know about.  One is visiting me next month!  But...about the licence.  I have the same outstanding fines shawn.  Only they are from 2003 and I have totally ignored them.  They farmed them out to various collection agencies.  When they tried to collect on behalf of 'CITY OF TORONTO'....I asked them if they had proof of my contract with that corporation.  Then I served them notice in writing for documentation.  They sold the 'debt' very quickly.  If you acknowledge the debt or pay even a tiny bit then you have given it life.  Your only option is like mine to deny you require a licence.",
