   "message": "Thanks Derek.  I think they literally have redefined the roads as 'rivers of commerce'.  The courts are definately maritime jurisdictions for the traffic offenses.  'Mister' is actually 'master' which is a nautical title too.  In any case it's a fucking church inquisition tribunal too.  You're guitly or guilty with some excuse.  You are in dishonour for arguing with a superior officer....and since you were charged by one it's insubordination to even show up.  You should have paid the fine upon arraignment and disclosure.....or as soon as the cop made out the ticket.",
