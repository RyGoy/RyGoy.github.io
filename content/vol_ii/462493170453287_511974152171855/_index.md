   "message": "So, I made a 'special appearance'  at a court in Newmarket yesterday.  Trial for suspended driving and running red light.  (I didn't see the blushing red light in the room so I would have gotten off by 'pleading' not guilty anyway.)     I slapped down the two packets of 'disclosure' in front of the persecutor.  I said I  looked at all this and don't wish to contract with you.  I also gave a copy of Scott Duncan's (thank you for posting it here!!!)  Notice of Mistake.  And my unique Birth Cetificate...more about that another time.  \n\n  The calling of the name of course happened after all other entities had been dealt with.  Funny enough...the two ladies called my given name.   To which I replied hesitantly...yes....?   Then they repeated with the surname to which I quickly replied no....but I'm here for that matter. Then I was invited to 'come aboard'...(matey).  I declined respectfully....and was invited again.  The Goddess...the judge must have been a goddess since all were calling her 'your worship'...said I was disrespecting her and the court.  I had of course already informed her that I was claiming commonlaw jurisdiction, all rights reserved, waive all benefits and privileges....so it was my court, yes? In any case she then asked if I was a 'freeman on the land'.   Sheesh!   What's that I asked?...yuk, yuk.  Then she insisted again to entice me onto her ship...Oh...let me add...what is the union jack...the British flag doing in the corner?!...Is this an embassy or ship in dry dock...I wanted to ask but we couldn't get past the railing issue.   She warned me she would have me removed.....she did...had me escorted from the room...she said my 'papers' are on the last row of seats by the door...lol.  I removed my bc and Notice of Mistake...and left their 'defendant' solicitations...and walked out. \n\n But...I had a spy who remained.    He heard them talk in secret like cowardly conspirator in dishonour.  They sent one of the armed thugs to retrieve the 'papers'.  She asked him if there was anything 'interesting' among them.  No....yuk, yuk...their own stuff is of course not interesting.  Then they decided to arrange for 'ex parte' hearing for next year in or for my name.  Are they obligated to tell me this?",
