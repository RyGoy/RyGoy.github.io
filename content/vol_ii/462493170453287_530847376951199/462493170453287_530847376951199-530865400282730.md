   "message": "Ok, here's some tips:\n\nIf you see an article claiming \"SCIENTIFIC PROOF OF (x)\", then you should immediately dismiss it. There is NO SUCH THING AS \"SCIENTIFIC PROOF\". The ONLY people who USE the term \"Scientific Proof\" are people who know NOTHING about what science even IS.\n\n...and anything that PRESUMES AS FACT something that does not exist (The Soul) even exists, is NOT SCIENCE. Prove there is a \"Soul\" first.\n\n...and why would it transfer BIRTH defects? Seriously that's what the claim is.\n\nSeriously, I am now dumber for having read it. :D",
