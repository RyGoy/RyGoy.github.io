   "message": "Some uplifting, motivational (and content relevant) tunes. \n\n\"The Hand That Feeds\" is a verbal attack on the United States Government, specifically the Bush Administration and its foreign policy, but can be interpreted as speaking out against abusive authority in general.\n\n2005 MTV Movie Awards\n\nNine Inch Nails was scheduled to perform this song live at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, but MTV denied Trent Reznor's request to perform in front of a large image of President George W. Bush's face. As a result, Reznor decided to cancel the performance. NIN was replaced by the Foo Fighters.Reznor responded on the Official NIN Website:\"We were set to perform 'The Hand That Feeds' with an unmolested, straightforward image of George W. Bush as the backdrop. Apparently, the image of our President is as offensive to MTV as it is to me. See you on tour this fall when we return to play in America.\"",
