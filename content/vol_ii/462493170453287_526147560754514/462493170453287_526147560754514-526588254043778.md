   "message": "Hello guys, I'm also a member of this group :P Uncanny to scroll through and see this. I can explain what happened. She put it in front of me to sign... (not wanting to create controversy by refusing) I asked 'what will happen to me if I don't sign it?' (conditional acceptance) - leading to a rant of 'you'll be thrown back in that cell and you'll stay there until you see the judge'.  - Ok, says I - that's duress so I begin to write 'under duress' before signing my name through the words. After I had wrote that she snatched the pen and prevented me from signing and then she put another pen down flat on the page so i couldn't write under the signature (that's why the letters are all up off the line). She signed the other surety, scribbled it out and signed the rest. I ultimately ended up in mountjoy (prison) but to me this is still unresolved as i was held for breach of bail BUT my argument is that that agreement was under duress, therefore absent consent. I've been meaning to follow this up but haven't been able to with college (I went back to study law), but i'm finished that now so perhaps I should pick this back up again? hmmmm.",
