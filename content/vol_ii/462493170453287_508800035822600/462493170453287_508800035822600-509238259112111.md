   "message": "Sometimes I wonder if the rebellious teenager isn't at a great advantage at this point. I mean if they are willing to tell their parents to go fuck themselves should they be more willing to do the same with government? I was transporting a van full of teenage girls home from a soccer tournament. Not ONE thought there was any need for government. They all felt that most of the earth and problems that exist are because it has been left to government and the rich to decide. I was very impressed with their ability to see through the \"it is for your own protection\" scam. GO TEENAGERS",
