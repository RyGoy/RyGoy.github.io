   "message": "I am on it as much as my children will listen. I MOSTLY tell them to ask as many questions as possible so they too can learn. My oldest was arrested along with 3 other minors. She was told to remove certain articles of clothing, I was never contacted (she IS a minor) and she was denied a phone (even tho she requested one). She was the only one who did NOT sign anything and was still released.",
