   "message": "Yes, reserved all rights. Also, the Judge\" said he couldn't hear me unless I crossed the bar. So I made it clear that being forced through the bar I was in no way consenting to contract and still reserved all my God-given rights. Also put in court file Affidavit of Reservation of Rights, Affidavit of Status. Pointed out that we could not proceed as there was no plaintiff.  Said there was no man/woman present with a verified claim against me, a man. I also did not \"understand/stand under\" the charges.",
