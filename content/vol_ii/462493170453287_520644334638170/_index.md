   "message": "I'm new in this group but not new to what is going on. Very aware of Corp US. Spent 70 days in jail awaiting sentencing for \"Simulating legal process\" because I exercised Article 7 of the Bill of Rights. This all started with Discover Card dishonoring my instrument for discharge. At no time did I give them jurisdiction, they just took it their way all the way. Even brought in a sniper judge from another county. He had no problem violating his oath and breaking other laws during the whole thing. When I asked if he was a public trustee, 4 times, he said he didn't have to answer that. The whole thing was a farce. Now, I'm on probation for 3 1/2 years. Even that I didn't consent to except under duress as I need to support my family. Yeah, I know, lotsa luck getting a job with being a convicted felon.",
