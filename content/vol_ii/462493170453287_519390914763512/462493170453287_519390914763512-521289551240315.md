   "message": "Ive gotten it into my head while discussing all this stuff that it be best if in the position, to deliberately stop short of before 'crossing-the-bar' and make it immediately clear to the justice that- \"I am here by special appearance under protest ONLY, not GENERAL appearance, special appearance under protest ONLY, as it is not my INTENT to create joinder with this court of admiralty; do you take Judicial Notice of the fact your Justice, that i am here by special appearance under protest only and do not CONSENT to any joinder created by ME with this court of admiralty?\".....if the Justice says \"yes;\" wouldnt you then be 'boarding-the-ship' with the Justice now fully being aware that you are ONLY doing so  as sort of a 'guest' and/or 'visitor?'.....i might get my ass-handed-to-me by Scott for throwing this out there, but this all brings up a good point ultimately; do we go through the- \"I reserve all rights\"-mantra BEFORE we cross-the-bar,\" or, is it still okay/safe to cross-the-bar first and deliver the \"I reserve all rights...\" even AFTER having crossing-the-bar..... :/",
