   "message": "Thank you Derek.\n\n...as for those who think like Daslow Aizelasi, on this VERY SIMPLE AND BASIC concept, I think it's time to accept that you are using resources others could be using, and the ONLY ethical thing to do is kill yourself. Please video the act, so we can post it here on THE TENDER FOR LAW. I've always wanted to run a forum that has a body-count. :D\n\nSeriously, I see all these dipshits who claim to be \"studying for years\" and they can't grasp the SIMPLEST concepts. EVERY ONE OF THOSE DIPSHITS are a THREAT to MY initiatives, and when my duties are fulfilled, such people will NOT be tolerated/abided... \n\nI long for those days to arrive soon. Seriously, I fucking HATE every single one of you with stultified brains. I really want to take a blade and cut you all up slowly, one-by-one, because you rob me of so much.",
