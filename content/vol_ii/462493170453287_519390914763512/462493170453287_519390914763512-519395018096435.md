   "message": "Here's a little tidbit, I was in court on Wed, the Justice said, they don't do point of order and he couldn't understand the Notice of Mistake.  So I sent him a little \"Notice of I'll fucking lien your law licence!\"  I am back there on Wed., next week, lets see if he changes his tune!!
