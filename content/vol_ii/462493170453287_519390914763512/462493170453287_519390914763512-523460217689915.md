   "message": "Thanks Scott,  sorry unlike yourself most of us were not born into this with a silver spoon in our mouths & raised on it.  Maybe you should be pointing the finger at the Nobles who allowed this knowledge to slip away.  You may be fulfilling your duty now but what about the years you sat back and watched it all happen?  And you are calling me an idiot.  I think those who had the knowledge and did not share are the idiots and we are merely the circumstantial outcome.  You say we have no value, well what value does your constant rage and anger have? How do you benefit from it?  Oh wait I forgot Scott is God.   Sorry GOD",
