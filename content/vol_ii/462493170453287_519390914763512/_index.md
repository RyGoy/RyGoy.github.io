   "message": "The original NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and, \"POINT-OF-ORDER!...\"- threads all into one.....\n\nAbove all, questioning deflects SURETY.\n\nQuite possibly one of the most useful documents I have ever published is my NOTICE OF MISTAKE for Dean. This is a useful, powerful document that also instantly removes SURETY. I framed it in such a way that you can replace the name \"Dean Clifford\" with your name, and you can make a pad of these things. Have lots of copies to hand out to friends and opposing counsel. Hell the court clerk loves these things too...make sure the court clerk has one as well. Just make sure you UNDERSTAND what the document says. Read it carefully and understand what the words mean, because you will be challenged. And remember, the NOTICE by its very nature, presents several questions.\n\nDo not permit the proceedings to move forward without these questions being answered!\n\nBecause so many people ask for it, transcribed here is the copy of THE ROGUESUPPORT NOTICE OF MISTAKE.\n\nScott Duncan:  *Sigh*\n\nSubmit it as an EXHIBIT in an AFFIDAVIT. They can't refuse your SWORN TESTIMONY!\n\n  NOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\n1.  TAKE NOTICE THAT: In the matter of SURETY for the LEGAL NAME, I believe that there has been a MISTAKE, as the SOLE BENEFICIARY OF A PUBLIC DOCUMENT has been INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED as an \"accused\" and/or a \"suspect\". \n2.  FORGIVE ME: If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR SUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led A COURT and/or STATUTORY BODY and/or A GOVERNMENT SERVICE and/or AGENTS and/or OFFICERS of such bodies, to believe, by responding to �You�, and/or �JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN�, and/or SUCH OTHER IDENTIFICATION, such bodies HAVE ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am the PARTY WITH SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE, and please forgive me.\n3.  If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR SUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led A COURT and/or STATUTORY BODY and/or A GOVERNMENT SERVICE and/or AGENTS and/or OFFICERS of such bodies, to believe, by responding to �You�, and/or �JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN�, and/or SUCH OTHER IDENTIFICATION, such bodies HAVE ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am, in ANY CAPACITY, a Pro Se litigant  and/or a LEGAL PERSON in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE, as I DO NOT CONSENT and WAIVE THE BENEFIT to such titles (Waiver of the CHANGE OF NAMES ACT OF ONTARIO). Please forgive me.\n4.  THEREFORE: As I have no knowledge of who �You� and or �JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN� and/or SUCH OTHER IDENTIFICATION ANY COURT and/or STATUTORY BODY and/or GOVERNMENT SERVICE and/or AGENTS and/or OFFICERS of such bodies [HEREAFTER \"YOU\"], HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, I RESPECTFULLY ASK; by WHAT AUTHORITY ARE \"YOU\" ADDRESSING me as such?\n5.  As the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) has been deposited into the COURT [In the custody of Justice Wailan Low, ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE: Court File Number CV-11-430464], WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I, as a MAN who is not lawfully entitled to the BENEFITS of a BIRTH CERTIFICATE [PPSACA13078], have any SURETY in this matter?\n6.  As GOVERNMENT is the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY on the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE), with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL NAME, WHAT EVIDENCE do YOU have that I am a TRUSTEE for the LEGAL NAME. WHAT EVIDENCE do YOU have that I am a TRUSTEE and have ANY SURETY with respect to ANY NAME?\n7.  WHAT EVIDENCE do YOU have, that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a TRUSTEE and/or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN? WHAT EVIDENCE do \"YOU\" have of any WARRANT OF AGENCY for the principal?\n8.  WHAT EVIDENCE do \"YOU\" have that there has been any meeting of the minds, any PROPER NOTICE given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or that I have ANY INTENT to CONTRACT in this matter?\n\nAs such, I am returning your OFFER, DECLINED, for immediate DISCHARGE and CLOSURE.\n\n[ AUTHORISED BY:                              ] [ AQUILAE Trust Seal]\n\n- \"POINT-OF-ORDER!\"..... (Scott has typed-out two versions of this so far...use some words at your own peril) :/\n\nHere is my court room position in a nutshell.\n\nYou do not accept surety � EVER.\n\nStep 1: Reserve all rights. (get Derek Moran [im honoured to be mentioned, by the way] to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)\n\nStep 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed. Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS. If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.\n\nAnything outside of this supports their position that you are �playing� their game, and thus it is presumed that you understand the rules. The only way to counter this is to declare that you CANNOT UNDERSTAND the rules without these questions being answered.\n\nThink very carefully about this. If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling\nand its rules, you might raise the obvious question, �Why do you get to move two pieces?� If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?\n\nIf you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that's when you're going to �understand� that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game. You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert. \n\nIf you UNDERSTAND, you accept SURETY.\n\nAs stated YOU=SURETY\n\nIf you're ever in a courtroom and do not wish to have the \"benefit of SURETY\", you have but to object to being addressed as \"YOU\". There are many ways to do this. Dean Clifford might say, in response to being addressed as \"YOU\", \"If I have led the court to believe that I am SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE. Please forgive me.\" (FUN FACT: A court MUST ALWAYS grant forgiveness when asked and/or requested)\n\nOthers, like myself, are a lot more succinct. For example, I might respond, \"FUCK YOU! You're a YOU, I'm a ME! By what AUTHORITY do YOU address ME as a \"YOU\"?\", because I can get away with it. The reason I can get away with it is that I UNDERSTAND the UCC as opposed to ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD which spreads mythology and bullshit about the UCC.\n\n  Section 1, Subsection 308, of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE covers RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. This is a well-known fact, and this is how you use it.\n\nVersion #1:  On entering the court, you aggressively make the first motion, that being, the RESERVATION OF YOUR RIGHTS. But since you're the only one in the courtroom with ACTUAL STANDING, you can be a total dick about it. You don't RESERVE YOUR RIGHTS, you RESERVE ALL RIGHTS! Not just yours, EVERYONE's. You remove everyone else's rights and give them to yourself. WHY? Because \"Fuck off that's WHY!\" You're the only one with STANDING.\n\nIf you HOLD the power, WIELD it...don't be such a pussy! If you're entitled to ALL RIGHTS, CLAIM THEM. This is how you do it.\n\nWhen the \"justice\" starts speaking, interrupt them. Say, \"Point of order!\" They will immediately be silent. At that point, state \"I believe I am the only party with standing, so barring objection from the court, I wish to RESERVE ALL RIGHTS now, and henceforth. Are there any objections from the court?\" As the court has no standing to respond, simply speak to the record as such, \"Let the record show that I have reserved all rights, and the court has not objected.\" At this point if they say anything to you, you simply say, \"Objection. The record shows that I have reserved all rights, and I have not granted you leave to speak. Why are you speaking?\"\n\nDo the same when opposing counsel attempts to speak. You will then be posed the question, \"How do you wish to proceed in this matter?\" for that is the one question a slave has the right to ask. What is their master's wish?\n\nVersion #2:  *judge begins to speak at his trial* \"Point of order!\" *judge goes silent* \"BARRING ANY OBJECTION FROM THE COURT, at this time I WISH to reserve ALLl rights. Is there ANY objection from the court?\n\n*Jeopardy Music*\n\nAny objections?\n\n*Clock Ticking*\n\n....Lookin' for OBJECTIONS FROM THE COURT! Going Once... (repeat second and third time)\n\nAs the court has NOT objected I have , IN FACT, reserved ALL rights. (It is a FACT that's ON RECORD, and I wish the court to SHUT ITS FUCKING PIE-HOLE!) (...be silent).\n\nQUESTION: if you have RESERVED ALL RIGHTS, and they don't understand what you are referring to, when you speak of the PUBLIC RECORD, ASK your BITCH SLAVE, WHAT THE FUCK? ...like so:\n\n\"Point of ORDER! It is MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS, IN FACT, A COURT OF THE PUBLIC RECORD. Am I MISTAKEN?\n\nAs I, myself have, IN FACT, RESERVED ALL RIGHTS (Not YOUR rights, ALL rights. The rights of everyone in the court have been surrendered to you!) I wish to convene a COURT OF THE PUBLIC RECORD (Barring ANY objections from the court).\n\nFirst: You are not making MOTIONS. Do NOT allow them to say that they are.\nRe: \"I don't understand\", respond that you require the supernumerary to RECUSE HIM/HER SELF as they are on record as being LEGALLY INCOMPETENT to do their job.\n\nYou'll recall in other articles and comments, the levels of the caste system and how they give instructions.\n\nNOBILITY (KINGS AND QUEENS) EXPRESS THEIR \"WISHES\".\n\nADMIRALTY ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS BY REQUESTING, ADDRESSING THEIR SUBORDINATES AS \"MR\".\n\nGENERALS GIVE ORDERS.\n\n  The fact that if you have all the rights, and everybody else has none, you are CLEARLY the KING. So you are going to have to learn to give instruction by expressing your wishes. This is why they are asking how you \"wish to proceed\". Courts grant and test your SOVEREIGNTY all the time. You simply have to listen to the words they are using. At this time you may respond, \"I wish to prove to some ass-wipe who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth, the things I know, so I wish to go to trial PRO SE. But I wouldn't recommend this...I would simply wish the case to be dismissed.\n\nIf they say anything else besides \"I agree, case dismissed\", you exercise your AUTHORITY by questioning. MASTERS QUESTION, SLAVES ANSWER. For instance if a \"justice\" said anything except \"I agree. Case dismissed,\" you question why they are even speaking. \"I'm sure you'll recall Mr. (insert justice's name here) that at the beginning of these proceedings I explicitly reserved all rights, including yours. Have I not made my wishes clear?\"\n\nWhen you're in the court room dealing with these babbling, sacks-of-shit, learn to use the breaks. Repeat after me, �I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS�. If they ignore your question, then your next response should be, �OBJECTION. If the court cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.� Keep repeating that, and repeating that, and repeating that...until they answer your fucking question. \n\nAlways remember to respond in the form of a question. A question serves the dual-purpose of establishing your authority, and negating the possibility of UNDERSTANDING; because before, the most powerful of these questions is, \"Who are you?\" UNDERSTANDING cannot be presumed until that question is answered.\n\nAbove all, questioning deflects SURETY.",
