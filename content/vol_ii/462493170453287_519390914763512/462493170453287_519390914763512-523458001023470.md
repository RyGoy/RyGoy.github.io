   "message": "In The Dictionary of Canadian Law, the very last line in the definition for CROWN CHARGES is: \"...by virtue of any contract.\"\n\n I think this is relevant because the  average-'person' going into court is doing so thinking that it will be the same way they saw it on JUDGE JUDY- you give your side, they give their side, and then the Judge will give their decision based on FAIRNESS and IMPARTIALITY relative to the law. The average-'person' has NO idea that this is based on these imaginary (but maybe not in some cases) SUMMARY EXECUTION OF MERCANTILE INSTRUMENTS. It SEEMS the NOTICE OF MISTAKE is a very non-adverse alternative to saying what i think all of us REALLY want to say to these public-servants- WHERE'S THE FUCKING CONTRACT, THAT OH BY THE WAY, NEVER EXISTED IN THE FIRST PLACE?!?",
