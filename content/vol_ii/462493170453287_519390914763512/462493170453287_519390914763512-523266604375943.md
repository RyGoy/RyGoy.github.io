   "message": "This might be a stupid question but, If we want to avoid belief because ALL belief is evil, then why are we saying \"I believe\" in the very first paragraph of the NOTICE?  Should we not be saying something like \"I wish to contest there has been a mistake\"  as a King expresses their wishes.  Also in such couldn't saying I believe leave it open for debate as it is being presented as an opinion and not a fact?",
