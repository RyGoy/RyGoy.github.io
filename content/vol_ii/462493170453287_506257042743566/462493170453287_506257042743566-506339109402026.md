   "message": "I feel stupid for being congratulated for a \"copy and paste\" compilation (that takes some really expert skills!). But in a world where standards have become so low, life is a breeze. :D\n\nYet in a serious note, I do know that having all these information put together in a document, could turn into a great tool for study for some, at TTFL.\n\nI have organized my own version into subjects, and then I have dragged everything related to that subject, and joined it. Surety, Bitcoin, How to proceed in Court, How to isolate in Admiralty, etc. Then, I have tried to also make a separation of civil vs criminal, and how it relates to the subjects. I am still working on it.\n\nAnyways, I thank Scott, and everyone that has engaged actively in contributing to the group.",
