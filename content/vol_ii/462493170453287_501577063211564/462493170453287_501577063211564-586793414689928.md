   "message": "Derek Moran: Ohhh- Scott covered this awhile back: BIRTH CERTIFICATE = BILL OF LADING.. WE = the CARRIER.. and the CARGO/GOODS we CARRyIER around = THE NAME on the BIRTH CERTIFICATE/BILL OF LADING.. and then something about NOT being in COMMERCE, if we are TRANSPORTING instead...as long as we are CARRIERing the BC/BILL OF LADING around, we are deemed to be performing a public function of government to that of a POSTMAN, like a letter-CARRIER.....Kate of Gaia has driven home the point that like all letters/the BC/BILL OF LADING, this letter too has to be DELIVERED, until then, we are all POSTMEN/letter-CARRIERS walking around performing a government-function without realizing it, making us DEEMED to be TRUSTEES, hence, why we are TAXED",
