   "message": "Court Appearance\n\n[This is why we should avoid voluntarily appearing in court]\n\nA general appearance cures antecedent irregularity of process, a defective service, etc. \nCertain legal consequences are attached to the voluntary act of a person. \nThe presence of the body cures the error in the name; the truth of the name cures an error in the description \nAn error in the name is immaterial if the body is certain. \nAn error in the name is nothing when there is certainty as to the person. \nThe truth of the demonstration removes the error of the name.",
