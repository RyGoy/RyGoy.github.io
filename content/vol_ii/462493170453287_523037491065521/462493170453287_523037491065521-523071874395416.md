   "message": "Justin Moule shared with me the email he got from someone-who-thinks-they're-in-charge-of-something, regarding the vaccination of his daughter. Then he showed me the reply he sent, this essay on all the stuff that is WRONG with vaccinations. I asked him- could i have that lady's email, i wanna ask her one simple question, ill keep it honourable, and ill copy it to you...this is what i wrote to her:\n\nHi Ms. Cameron - how are you?\n\nWhen it comes to deciding to whether or not to give consent to having someone stick a needle in a child's arm filled with god-who-knows what, it always comes back to a simple question i have of my public-servant-trustees with a fiduciary duty to do whatever is in my best interests, simply put; what is the jurisdiction of law in Ontario?\n\n..a long-way granted of saying- \"BY WHAT AUTHORITY, and WHO the fuck are YOU?!\"........no answer to that question yet",
