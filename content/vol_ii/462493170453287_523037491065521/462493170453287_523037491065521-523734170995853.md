   "message": "I'v thought about this subject alot since i joined here. Most of the belief structures listed i honestly never had and this as seen as a \"bad attitude\" by those that cling to them. When i first joined here i didn't believe a word as i had never so much as heard of Scott or Tara but now I know he is right for that very reason because A it makes sense and B i cant rebut or contradict anything he is saying and my own reading brought me to those conclusions. Not saying i don't have any belief structures holding me back i have took on board information i don't understand as fact at time's because it sounded good I'm working hard to get rid of that.",
