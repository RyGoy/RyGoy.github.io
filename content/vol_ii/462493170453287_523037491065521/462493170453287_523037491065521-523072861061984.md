   "message": "Mr. Frisbey, allow me to demonstrate the flaw in your thinking: In 1989 I had my EMAIL ADDRESS on my business cards. The only people who knew what it was, were those qualified to understand what it was... Yet NOW the things my parents called \"secret code\" are commonplace....and none of you actually know how it works.\n\nMy FUCKING EMAIL ADDRESS was the biggest \"mystery\" in the family. I was even accused of being \"crazy\".\n\nHere is how the world saw the internet, way back then:\nhttp://youtu.be/MV6lzMfeq78\n\nEven with that information, you STILL could not grasp what an email address was, back then.\n\n...just as you could not grasp bitcoin, and how you could not grasp what I am building in order to steal this hidden-in-plain-sight thing, that all of you are to blind to see.\n\nI'm trying to educate as fast as I can, but it really is too late for most of you. By the time you see the value of what I took, it will be of use ONLY to me. I'll decide who gets the benefit, after that.",
