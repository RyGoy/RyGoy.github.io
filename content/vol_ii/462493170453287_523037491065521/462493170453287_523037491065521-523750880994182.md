   "message": "Tara Duncan, I have read ALL of the subjects you have posted here. I find the subject of belief (and how you conveyed your perception) very relevant to where man finds himself today. I LOVE challenging every belief. Anytime I hear myself using the word, I switch to thinking about the \"belief\" and researching rather than believing. Thank you for your time and effort. My father has also been reading your writings. I am ever so grateful as he has set the stage for belief in my life and anytime I challenge him he just gets annoyed. I wish all could wipe the slate clean, then start over without belief.",
