   "message": "I'm delighted to say that when Scott explained that ALL BELIEF IS EVIL I absolutely grasped what he was saying right off the bat for once. I have ditched the saying \" I believe\" in any conversation and have replaced it with ( \"My opinion given what information I have is.... blah blah blah, but I don't really know, it's only my opinion.\" ) when I cannot truthfully say \"I know\" (Have knowledge) I'm really pleased with myself on that one. Thanks Scott and secondary thanks to Tara Duncan :-)",
