   "message": "Belief systems aren't just about religion.\n\nThe beliefs we hold about ourselves are more damaging than any religion. Granted many of the beliefs we hold about ourselves originated in religion.\n\nThe only way that one can get out of the current system we find ourselves in is suspending their belief in it.\n\nThere is validity and actual empowerment in suspending belief systems instead of feeding them.",
