   "message": "It seems the only \"theme\" involving belief that I think of is the \"because some one said so\" theme. I was putting that perspective out there. Most people that say they \"believe\" something have been \"told\" that something by some one they believe is smart. The only reason these people question that belief is because something that some one whom they believe is smarter then the first tells them some thing that contradicts the original belief.",
