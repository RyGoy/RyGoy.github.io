   "message": "Roguesupport Nx: That's the problem with cognitive dissonance. Thinking and believing are mutually exclusive. When someone advances a fact that is in direct conflict with what you \"believe\" it is impossible to hold onto the belief if you are examining the foundations of why you think your \"beliefs\" are true.\n\nUnfortunately, in the case where your entire entire existence is founded on a series of \"beliefs\", how can you let that go without completely re-examining who and what you are? Belief, when countered with logic, has the ability to �lock� people's brains. The only defense against letting go of all unproductive thought is to stick your fingers in your ears, reiterate your beliefs at the top of your lungs, and hope that insulting the person talking to you will convert them, or make them go away.\n\nHoly �Three Little Pigs� house foundation kids. Talking to people who �believe� everything, but don't actually �know� anything, is largely predictable and very tiring.",
