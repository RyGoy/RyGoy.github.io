   "message": "Scott Duncan: \" If OPPT is what I \"believe\" it to be, then obviously all of what Scott & you guys stand for is null & void. \"\n\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I rest my case.\n\nTHIS is why \"belief\" needs to be destroyed. Ignoring reality and smugly saying \"belief\" trumps it. This is rational in his eyes.\n\nEVERY time one of you sells belief, i see this play out. If you've EVER wondered how the Noble Lie took hold, this is it.\n\nThe \"virtue\" this guy espouses is what allows entire cultures to be victimized. Keep that in mind whenever you see these people selling \"belief\" as the highest principle.\n\nThese are the \"mafia wives\" of the system. ENABLERS.\n\nALWAYS hit them with the ridicule and contempt they deserve.",
