I do not want to waste anyone's time. \n\n\n\n\nMy beliefs were shattered a few years ago and I am still trying to get my bearing.  I do not want to distract or detract from the importance of what this group represents....\n\n\n\n\nScott states we value the wrong things... What would be the correct things to value?\n\n\n\n\nI seek knowledge..... I value this and my life above all.",
