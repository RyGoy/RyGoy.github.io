   "message": "3 people waiting in the hallway ganged-up on me last week while waiting for our paralegal-class to start when i told them the Criminal Code \"does not apply to you, unless you acquiesce to it through your implied consent\". . ..\"EVERYBODY KNOWS the Criminal Code applies to EVERYONE\" they all said. . .\"Really? Have you ever read section 2. of it where the definitions are for \"every one-person-owner\"...do you understand what 'include' means in legalese, you guys ARE in a paralegal course this MIGHT be important for you all to know in the long-run\"..... they all just looked at me with this sense of resentment, almost for having pulled their heads out of the sand",
