   "message": "I too am scared... since I was very young.  I did not realize to what depths until I started taking action.  There is a warrant out for me. I am living in a vessel called Serenity. Every time I see a cop my heart leaps to my throat.... the only satisfaction I receive is knowing that I have access to the information presented in this group.  Knowledge is tremendously empowering.  So I am afraid... I am not incapacitated but I still battle depression.  I know I am not helpless but the lifetime of conditioning keeps me going 3 steps forward and 1 or 2 steps back. I am stocking my toolbox with the  notices and legal instruments presented only these threads.  I choose not to engage,  I will be kidnapped at some point.... I have a lot of work left to do.\n         So Pete Daoust  I do not judge you.... I relate to exactly what you have stated above..",
