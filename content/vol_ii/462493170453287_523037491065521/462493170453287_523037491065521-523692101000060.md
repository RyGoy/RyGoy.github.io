   "message": "I have read through the 108 (now 109) comments on this thread, subtracted those which have no relevance to the topic, subtracted those that say nothing useful, and have arrived at the conclusion that approximately 9% of comments are even remotely connected to what was initially written.\n\nOf these, unless anyone cares to point to something specific (and defend their reasons for the choice), I don't see any comments that couldn't be erased without any loss of pertinent information.  This includes comments that I have written.\n\nWithout useful feedback I am unable to tell if the topic is interesting, relevant or useful to those who read it.  It is possible, but unlikely, that someone will read through 109 comments looking for additional insight or clarification.  It is more likely that anyone who wades through the morass of useless thoughts, will decide the subject material was of so little importance, that no one bothered to take it seriously.\n\nRight now I'm not seeing any reason to post follow-up information on this topic.  I don't take issue with what you comment specifically.  I just don't want the things I write to be associated with stupid shit.",
