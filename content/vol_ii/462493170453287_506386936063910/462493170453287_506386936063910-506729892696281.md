   "message": "You should have charged that judge with falsifying a document...and I didnt kniw anyonr coukd FORCE anyone to sign ANYTHING. I would think it would be these \"forced\" contracts that the OP woild apply to, and in such cases (like yours) im thinking THAT is when I would make sure I add \"under duress\", \"without prejudice\", \"all rights reserved\", or \"kiss my black ass\", to my signature. Ive had cops write \"refuse to sign\" on shit I wasnt even asked to sign...I was asleep after they had kidnapped me, and snuck and stuck a notice at my feet like bitches and then said I didnt sign...which is fine for I later saidbi was unaware as I was.presented with nothing.\n\nTheres something from days of old where signing things with an X meant something.... or so my memory archives tell me...",
