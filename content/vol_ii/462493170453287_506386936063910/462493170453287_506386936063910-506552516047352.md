   "message": "I know here in Michigan they try to force us to sign a \"advice of rights\" form at arraignment or right at the beginning of the next hearing if one didn't sign it and doesn't Reserve All Rights \"ab intio\" to be exempt and in full control, accordingly thereafter the judge in county district court threatens them to be in \"contempt indefinitely\" if they don't sign, of course, I didn't and took exception to the rule and ol Kirk W TAbbey said you must, its a \"trust\" to make sure your constitutional protections are available; I laughed to myself (it's a trick for surety) and said you've taken an oath which you are bound by and all the trust I need to know of, have you not? and If not I don't trust anyone in here.",
