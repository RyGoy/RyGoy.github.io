I didn't have a clue what many really meant, they went right over my head. \n\nNOW, after getting to grasp many of the teachings by Scott, ALL those previous post MAKE MUCH SENSE TODAY.  Some look now brand spanking new to ME. \n\nSo just something  I wanted to share with the good people at TTFL group is to re-read ALL previous post. You will find the glittering of gold all over them.\n\nFor example, I wrote this thread back in April 25th, 2013. It's only NOW, August 12th, 2013, that I can say I truly comprehend INTENT in contracts. I used to read about it here, but things went right over my head. Today Scott revises INTENT in contracts, and NOW it makes sense.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/htviuvsf7voj61k/The%20Tender%20for%20Law%20-%20The%20Best%20of%21%20Gold%20nuggets%20notes.docx",
