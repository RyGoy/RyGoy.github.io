   "message": "If whoever puts the signature is the SURETY/LIABILITY, what about people who sign contracts, or negotiable instruments with \"All Rights Reserved\" \"Without Recourse\" \"Without Prejudice\"; does it change anything, really? Do people deflect SURETY by way of a particular signature? \n\nI know Scott has mentioned to sign:\" Authorized BY: _________________________ Non Assumpsit All Rights Reserved \" What would be the difference? How does signing like that relates/affects the SURETY?",
