   "message": "Well it does not have to do with me. There is a \"movement\" in the US of people making seminars, telling people to turn cheques of closed checking accounts into EFT's, and to sign and endorse a certain way.\nI think Derek talked about that in some thread.\n\nAlso, I read here about how is it that one should sing, if ever, any document. And you, and Derek, have given examples, not to mention Pierre, and I want to understand WHY is that people sign that way, and the implications of it.",
