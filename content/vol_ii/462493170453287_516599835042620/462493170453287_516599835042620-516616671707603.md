   "message": "I know a guy, who had to go to court, got in front of the judge, was told to state his name, so he just matter-of-factly asked- \"Umm...it'd be okay with the court if i first just went ahead and reserved my rights before we begin, right your Honour?\" I guess the judge just sat there with a stunned-look on his face. Like this guy said to me- \"What else was this judge going to say to me- 'NO. You cant reserve your rights before we begin.' He'd be admitting to everybody in front of the court that he was denying me MY RIGHTS.\" - LOL",
