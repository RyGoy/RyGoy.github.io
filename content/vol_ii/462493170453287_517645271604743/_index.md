   "message": "Would one of the admins please put a link to Black's Law 9th edition on the about page. I know it's buried here somewhere in one of the posts, but, with posts being re-prioritized from time to time, and the page growing by leaps and bounds, it makes finding it a considerable amount of effort. It would be helpful to find it in the about section. Please also consider putting links to the most important and crucial threads/post on the about page as well. I'm sure I'm not the only one repeatedly searching for hours to find a post that deserves further study and consideration.  I suggest that doing so would be invaluable to group members. As this page grows, navigating it is becoming increasingly difficult. Presently the above may take a few hours to accomplish. In six months or a year it may take several days of work or more to accomplish such a reference. Thanks :)",
