They seem intent on tweaking their format to ensure content is continually buried. @ Pete Here's an analogy: I see a mountain a mile high and 10 miles long, 3 miles wide with with more than a million worth of diamonds buried in it. I have a pick axe and a shovel. Lot's of value buried within that may take a several lifetimes to extract. The value is there but i may not benefit from it in any significant way  in this lifetime. <- Exageration for illustration. :)",
