   "message": "I have seen the NOTICE OF MISTAKE and I like the content.  However, would someone mind telling me, with all the necessary details, how the hell one would go about getting it into the Court?  Sending it to the Family Support division is a waste of time, I believe, since their statute likely does not allow them to recognize such things as having any legal significance.  A court order is all that can change the situtation from what I have seen.",
