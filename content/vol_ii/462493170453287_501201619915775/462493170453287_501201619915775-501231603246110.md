   "message": "Phillip Prater, if I was in  your shoes, given your level of knowledge here is what I would do.  File a motion under the existing Family Court Action,  offer some type of repayment plan for arrearage, ask for an order for lower payments and for an order directing the Family Support people to reinstate your person's license based on this offer.  You will need an affidavit explaining your person's situation as well as updated financial information for your person.  You will likely be able to find most of the information how to do this on-line. Go to the Family Court site and look  up motions and affidavits.  You will have to serve this on our ex's lawyer (or her if no lawyer) and file it with the court.  The Registrar will give you some genereal guidance likely.  This is not legal advice, just what I would do if I were in  your shoes.",
