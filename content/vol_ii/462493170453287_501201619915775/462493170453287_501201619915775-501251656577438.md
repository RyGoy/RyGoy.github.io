   "message": "James Allan, if I were to do this, I think that the arrearage Is mostly absorbed by the fact that i have had physical custody of one of the two children AND paid her money two of the three years that i have had the one child. The fact that she has continuously broken the visitation and relocation part of the parental agreement, even as far as moving two states away and punishing the children for talking to me, should have some kind of weight.",
