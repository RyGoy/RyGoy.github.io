   "message": "I dont believe there is anything you can write them that will have any effect.  I suspect going to a court of inherent jurisdiction (not family court) to have the mistake corrected and any orders under the fam court proceeding quashed and that action halted (prohibition writ) may work.  Unfortunatly, that is not an easy task and is ONLY theory based on my understanding.  Would love to know if others have done something that actually works.",
