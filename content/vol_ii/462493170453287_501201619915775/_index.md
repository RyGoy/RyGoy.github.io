   "message": "In order to make this straight in my head, I received a letter from the family support division stating: \nthe director of family support division finds that the above named person:\nresponded by entering a payment agreement but failed to comply with the agreement.\npursuant to sections 454.1000 and 454.1025 rsmo, the director orders the suspension of the above named person's driver's license and orders the person to refrain from the licensed activity.\n\nAs i read this 454.1025 it states a law license. second, i have sent to family sent to family support, a letter that stated that I believed that there attempt to suspend my license was a fraud and extortion based on a fraud by my ex-wife to collect money for a child I had in my posession for 3 years in june. Also that as i understand it a contract(divorce papers with child custody agreement) is between the two people that signed those papers. since she broke that contract continually and was the first to break it by refusing to allow the court ordered visitation among many other things that i listed, the contract becomes void and therefore there is no arearage. i accepted the offer to continue the agreement with them to pay if they could provide me proof that the contract between her and I  was still in effect, that they had a right to enforce a contract based on fraud, proof that they are allowed to harm a child that the enforcement order is for,proof that they have no responsibility to to notify that a fraud was being committed.\n\nI don't know where I went wrong in this letter but now with there response to order the suspension and orders me to stop driving, I could use some help figuring out where i went wrong and how to correct this. i am a chauffeur and that is how i make my money to support all of my family. If, hypothetically, you were in these shoes what would you do to prevent this. As I have not much money, i would be willing to donate what I can afford to prevent this.",
