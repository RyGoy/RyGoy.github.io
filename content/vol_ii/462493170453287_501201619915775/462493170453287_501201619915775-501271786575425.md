   "message": "This stuff is great in theory (and perhaps practice) and I don't want to shun creative approaches.  But, has anyone actually done one of these sucessfully such that they can guide Phillip on how to give it effect?  If so please share the \"specific\" details.  They may work, but despite my requests for details, no one has shown me, specifically, how they are done or proof of any success. And although I would love to believe that Santa is real, common sense dictates that if no one wants to step up and provide proof, I best go get my own present for under the tree.  Btw Rob is a great guy and I give hats off to anyone trying different appoaches.  But if none of us can give Phillip details how to do it where does that leave him? Not picking on Beverly for throwin it out there by any means.",
