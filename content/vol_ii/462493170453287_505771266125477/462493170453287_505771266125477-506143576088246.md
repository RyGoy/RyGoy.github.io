   "message": "I recently did this with credit card my mrs is a fan of them :( anyway i told them over the phone that before we continue payment i would like to get the original CREDIT AGREEMENT back....funny enough a week later i got a letter and a digital register of what they now termed....CREDIT CARD APPLICATION ...together with a interesting layout of all ACCOUNT DETAILS eg passwords, adresses etc. But what struck me was the fact that on the left corner of this breakdown was signed by same person who countersigned the CREDIT AGREEMENT...",
