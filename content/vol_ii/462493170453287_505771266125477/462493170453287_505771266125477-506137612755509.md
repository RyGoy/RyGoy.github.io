   "message": "Chris Schulte, this is just an opinion, but the note you entrusted to 'them' creates a trust relationship, whereby you entrusted your valuable instrument to them for safekeeping.  If they misplace it, then they owe you fair value/face value...as long as you can accurately describe it (send a photocopy, number, date of deposit etc) to demonstrate that you have given them reasonable opportunity to produce it for you, logic suggests that there shouldn't be a statute of limitations on it.  One way to find out is to send a bill & see what happens ;)",
