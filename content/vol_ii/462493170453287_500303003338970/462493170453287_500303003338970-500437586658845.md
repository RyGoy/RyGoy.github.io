   "message": "so, no one has actually used any of this stuff to get compensation?   I want to get my money soon in case they do away with money and then what????   I don't want anyone to do it for me, someone must have a process, I have heard of commercial lien but they don't allow commercial liens in NS unless it is a builders lien or is that irrelevant...I want to have the effect of giving my proper notice that they had the pleasure of screwing me and my family and this is what my rates are.    establish through affidavits?  that they don't rebut anything...they agree that they owe me the money and whatever.....and then demand payment....I sound crazy to myself....I know you, we need not to do things for people cause victims can do stuff for themselves, but I don't know what to do, where to start.  I just finished 2 years of (basically) law studies, I went to court, by their rules, which was dangerous, and I won.  I do not know anyone else in NS who lost custody of a child and got the child back.   And now that my child is home, less time for research....   and does anyone know if statute of limitations would apply to any of these less known methods.",
