   "message": "I haven't gone through much of threads yet but I might as well say that (at least for now) I don't buy, get it buy, that canada is a corporation...that seems to be fine for now to me.  Reading Scotts \"proper notice\" thread was easy for me to understand.  As soon as he talked about a courtesy, I got it.  My son and I got screwed but good by children's aid and NS gov. and I am ready to get paid for that service. of allowing them to do it..   I just decided that I can't wait until I learn and understand everything before I give public notice, or my bill,  to all those sons' of ignorant beeps.  (Funny I still get hostile when I think about this).  Hopefully, someone can lay out the process for me to let them know they used me for my services as a victim but I am not playing that game of victim anymore and I want my compensation and this is how much I am charging.  Pay up, final notice.    That is going to be my main goal for however long it takes.  I believe this country has produced a population of victims and what are victims?  people who need to be victimized.  SO;  I would be ever so grateful if someone could tell me the name of a process to use and give me step by step instructions.  I am not stupid, but my brain takes ages to put pieces together, I really need order for this so I can be confident.   If I know I am in the right I will not give up no matter what S**t they throw at me and I know they will.   I am asking because i had started studying tort law and stuff like that..but gov. writes their own laws and excuse themselves from any liability...so   that is no excuse for me to give up.  My son and I will get compensated.",
