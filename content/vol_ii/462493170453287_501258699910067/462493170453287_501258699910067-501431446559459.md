   "message": "just be aware   there is a time limit for temp. care orders and the judge will have to decide or he is in contravention of the act.. can brenda order the court in violation and insist the judge dismiss the case as CAS had time to prove their case and haven't.  Is that what the cas lawyer was trying to accuse brenda of( are they allowed to accuse people)  and wouldn't that be an admission of brendas competence?    CFSA45 (1) Where the court has made an order for temporary care and custody, the total period of duration of all disposition orders, including any supervision orders, shall not exceed:            c)where the child or youngest child that is the subject of the disposition hearing is twelve years of age or more, twelve months.    ABut they keep giving her more temp care orders..   *CFSA      42 (1) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing, the court shall make one of the following orders, in the child's best interests:\n(a) dismiss the matter;\n(b) the child shall remain in or be returned to the care and custody of a parent or guardian, subject to the supervision of the agency, for a specified period, in accordance with Section 43;    PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT I DO BELIEVE THE THINGS SCOTT SAYS ON THIS PAGE, BUT THEY ARE LARGELY UNTESTED.  bRENDA'S CHILDREN ARE REAL CHILDREN.   Just make sure everyone understands what the true risks are.  I stand behind you Brenda for seeing this through your way.  Cas still no no legal right (no matter what the law claims) to have custody and say.",
