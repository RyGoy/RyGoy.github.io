So today I served them with new Notices of mistake along with mistake of not consenting to Temporary Care and Custory Order and changing it to delcined. I had, not consented to the Order numerous times through affidavits and even stated in court and still kept getting them. Tomorrow Im serving them with Petition - Non negotiable. I am going to make their life so miserable, not even close to what they have done to us. But at least it is a start.",
