   "message": "Scott Duncan, this is what i did in court today. \nApril 9, 2013\nFamily Court\n\nAll rise please\nPlease be seated. A minute or two pause.\nI said POINT OF ORDER\nI believe I am the only one with standing , so barring objection from the court I wish to reserve all rights now, and henceforth, are there any objections from the court?\nYou wish to � reserve my rights, all rights\nWell you can certainly, whatever those rights may be, I uh terms of appealing or whatever, I uh that�s (something) the record to make decisions I guess.\nI wish to reserve all rights now and henceforth, and are there any objections from the court?\nLet the record show that the court that I have reserved all rights and the court has not objected\nI know,it, of no motion at this stage that, your motion doesn�t make any sense to me quite frankly. \n\nDid I have it nor not? I realized that they had gotten over me and I just sat down but eveytime they addressed me in court I asked by what authority did they address me as you and by what authority did they assume that I was a Party of Surety? Judge claimed not to understand. And when the cps lawyer stated that he needed me acknowledge something I didn't even answer any more. So the lawyer told the judge that that was border line contempt of court. In the end the hearing we were supposed to have next week got cancelled, and the notice of mistakes and affidavits that I had sent in and with the cps's lawyer I had a notice of default and affidavit for him that all got sealed into an envelope. He defaulted on all of the questions in the notice of mistakes. Do I re-enter the notice of mistakes cause they will be sending out another Temporary Care and Custody Order. At this hearing today there was the two pit bull lawyers, the broad is scarry(make you cringe, not even doable with a bag over her head) kids lawyer who never said two words and wanted scotty to beam her up, and three social workers in the room and 2 Sheriffs.  Can you tell me what the next best move would be, I'm thinking entering the notices of mistake again. Court is not till June again and i think it is only docket review",
