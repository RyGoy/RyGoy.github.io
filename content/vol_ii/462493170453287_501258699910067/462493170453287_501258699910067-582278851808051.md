   "message": "Just to back track a little, from what I gather - \n\nNOTICE=PUBLIC and PETITION=PRIVATE. I've heard from a very competent source (a national justice) you should stay out of the public as it prejudices EVERYTHING you submit/file as it is against PUBLIC POLICY. That is why they NEVER UNDERSTAND the notice of mistake and you must STAND and ASSERT it in open court. The notice reveals the TRUTH of the constructive TRUST in play (court) and no agent of the court wants to touch that HOT POTATO, especially in open court in front of the people!!\n\nPetitions should be submitted under seal, in camera (to chambers) through a 3d party, such as a NOTARY PUBLIC (it is the opinion of the court - all are fucking liars until a 3d party validates something)\nWhen something is reviewed in chambers, it is kept PRIVATE and the justice carries the knowledge with him to the bench.\n\nIn PUBLIC it is form OVER substance. In PRIVATE it is substance OVER form.\n\nMaybe it would be wise to start sending documents to the PRIVATE side of the courtroom instead of knocking heads with the PUBLIC side?\n\nTake it for what it is, hope this helps someone.",
