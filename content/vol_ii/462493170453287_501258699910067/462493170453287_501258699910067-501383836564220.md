   "message": "Joseph Pierre Gilles it's a matter of them showing their authority for the last 17 months. RCMP made shit up to \"help\"  CPS make their case, and realize now after reading Scott Duncan's Proper Notices that had we never accepted the original notice when they took the kids they would be home right now. I have affidavits that have gone to default against the social workers and RCMP and several more about to go into default. CPS just sent me more affidavits for the canceled hearing next week and now I have another  bunch of lies to default them on. I already have 3 letters from the department of Justice. The last one came registered mail. All three telling me that I am not following proper proceedure.",
