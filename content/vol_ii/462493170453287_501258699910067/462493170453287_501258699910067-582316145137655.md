   "message": "I don't get why people are compelled to make statements and reply to questions in open court.\n\nThe only things coming out of your mouth should be QUESTIONS. For example,\nDid you get the paperwork that was filed respective to this claim?\nWere the questions in that document answered? How? By who? Was it an affidavit? Under whoï¿½s authority? Can you share the answers in this court room here today as I have not received these answers? How can this gong show/trial continue if the questions submitted in the affidavit and/or notice have not been answered? Is there not fraud being committed here today? Am I not entitled to have questions answered? Why are questions not being answered? Are you suggesting that asking questions in this court today is an act of contempt? Is it not a fact that the crown prosecutor in this courtroom like to suck big cocks? Did the crown suck your cock today Mr justice hence you are showing favouritism towards him? Why do you keep suggesting that I am the fictitious juristic person and/or the decedent? Did the paperwork filed not clearly identify me as beneficiary of the trust? What your problem exactly?\n\nYou get the idea. Assert YOUR shit in YOUR filings and ASK QUESTIONS and INSIST on answers in court (if you insist on going). Just my 2 cents. Ok, back to work...",
