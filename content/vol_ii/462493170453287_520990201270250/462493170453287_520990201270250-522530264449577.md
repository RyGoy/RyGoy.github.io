   "message": "In 2009 I started utilizing the UCC as I could see no other way to get \"remedy\" for ANYTHING. The IRS is supposed to act as fiduciary in my discharge of debt. That's what IRS Form 56 does. I \"accepted the deed\" [the BC] and sent it off to treasury along with a Private Registered Bond for Set-Off, charge-back, etc......All for discharge of debt. Problem is that they are about 13 months behind and the \"payee\" of the crediting won't wait that long. PLUS, even if the IRS did in fact discharge that debt, it doesn't mean that the vendor [payee] won't come after me for the FRN's. Then I'd have to submit IRS form 3949a reporting tax fraud because the vendor is holding contraband funds that they did not pay tax on. \nTechnically, all we have to do is write \"Accepted\" on the tear off section of the \"bill\" and send it back to the entity asking for payment. But they dishonor that. That's why I'm working on a claim for damages as they violated my \"substantive right to set off debt\". \nThat's why for a few years now I've been examining the common law/court of record approach.",
