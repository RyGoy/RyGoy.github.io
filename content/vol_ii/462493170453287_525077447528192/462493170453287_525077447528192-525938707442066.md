   "message": "I was going to say... :) It's 100% natural/engrained in all of us to cry. Babies cry for all sorts of reasons, to grow and communicate, learn to vocalize... perhaps adults cry for many reasons as well. \n\nNothing wrong with a good hard cry... plus, to me it's also a form of vulnerability. If you can't cry in front of the people you love, why is that? You choose to do it when no one is around... \n\nJust in my honest opinion. Also, just another thought you said at night.. the end of your day, wind down time.",
