   "message": "because it is a script running that says so. bitminter.com\ni'm sort of just running it as a joke (scott yawns again)... no video card on that puter, and it's working at 70Khps which is nothing relative to the 25-100Mhps you really would want. cumulatively there are 6-10Thps just in the bitminting cluster, so that's quite a lot of competition. I would build a mining rig if i had the 1500 to drop on hardware and wasnt doing silly things like buying food or gas!",
