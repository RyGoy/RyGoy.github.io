   "message": "I was very naive about the level of corruption in Canada.  My eyes started to open when I got involved with child welfare, NS.  My last discovery has just about made me want to quit learning, but I need to learn in balance, not just about the corruption but how to effectively fight it.   I was flabergasted when I discovered that Child welfare agency was able to get privacy protected criminal records from the RCMP all for the asking.  Usually, you have to be border patrol, or interpol to get access or other law enforcement agencies,   Privacy Act section 8....unless you are given provincial authority  through an ACT to carry out an investigation (civil) child protection.   Not sure if these are the types of questions you all can address, but my brain is hurting so good night,  shout out to dean clifford...really appreciate you tube videos.....BUT I CAN'T GET HOW PROVINCIAL LAWS ARE ONLY FOR GOV. EMPLOYEES....",
