   "message": "thanks,  these are all things I want to learn, for myself, I need to know what makes this true,  I believe it is true but kids believe santa clause is true,,and you can't tell them any different , they have a very basic foundation for their childish belief,  yet you know they are wrong,???   When people start telling me I am crazy I am going to be able to know why I am right and how to prove it.  show me where/how do I learn all the foundational  stuff...EX:  you can tell a judge that i am not under your authority, so what,  he is still going to do what he wants to do.....I told a bunch of social workers the other day, that they were public servants and they work for me, but let me try and enforce that \"opinion\"",
