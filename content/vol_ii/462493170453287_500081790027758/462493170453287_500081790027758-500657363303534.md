   "message": "Ok...\nIt must be noted that MY definition of \"family\" differs from your interpretation. Mine is founded on the premise of Consanguinity,  not surname designation or allocation due to servitude...\nSo no \"family\" is not a \"household of slaves\"...irrespective of whether that household has servants or not.\n\n\"Extended from the human \"family unit\" by affinity and consanguinity are concepts of family that are physical and metaphorical, or that grow increasingly inclusive extending to community, village, city, region, nationhood, global village and humanism.\" So IF my \"ofthefamily\" is to \"extend\" past my bloodline, it would be, in MY CASE...to the guild I have \"sworn oath to\" (in a sense), as I am becoming a tradesman in a specific field, which included apprenticeships...\nLiken to the old days where \"The practice of sending children away to act as servants was even more common in towns than in the countryside. The inhabitants of towns largely made their livelihood as merchants or artisans, and this activity was strictly controlled by guilds. The members of these guilds would in turn employ young people � primarily boys � as apprentices, to learn the craft and later take a position as guild members themselves. These apprentices made up part of the household � or \"family\" � as much as the children of the master...\"so, if anything....I would be a member of THAT family.\nAs for a \"legal name\"...yes I guess I could incorporate my name myself...I'm only worried about my PRESENT \"legal\" fiction i.e. identity so that if I am surety to that name...I can ditch that name. And not do it \"legally\" because you know.... I'm dumb and ignorant and didn't think it's necessary to inform \"them \" of any \"name change\" since I am unaware if any \"legal\" obligations I have as a free person...so I can't really be \"responsible\" for much, esp the name they used to know me by. I don't \"know SHAWN FOLKES\" per se, and since I am a tradesman I intend to do business under a different name than the fiction that was designated to me...under the guild of my trade, to whom I pay my dues to.\n\nWhen I dump that attachment...do I return the government documents issued to me? And if so...which ones and where...or can I just chop them? Cuz you know...it comes down to this: I can handle my finances just fine on Nubian, and I don't need the government to manage my money for me.... I don't need THEIR accountants.\n\nI don't wanna shift off this topic but I have more questions...like concerning operating motor vehicles...esp if Im an independent tradesman that's driving while.pursuing my livelihood...\n\nOh yeah! I have my ORIGINAL photostatic copy of my BIRTH REGISTRATION...the microfiche! I was gonna laminate it but haven't.\nHow powerful is this document?",
