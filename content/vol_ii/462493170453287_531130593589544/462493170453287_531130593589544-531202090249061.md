   "message": "The Holy Bible and \"Jesus\" are 100% man written and thought bullshit to control society. Jesus' so called ministry campaign is 100% totally dependant on the military campaign of Titus Flavius. The New Testament is the literary version of the Arch of Titus, which still stands in Rome today. Educate yourselves and stop with the imaginary friend bullshit. You people are a danger to society. Why do you think there is a book of Titus in the NT? That is God (Vespasian) instructing his son (Titus) on how to deal with & treat their newly acquired slaves- those unruly Jews thet defeated in the Roman-Jewish War, that lasted seven years from 66CE to 73CE. http://www.caesarsmessiah.com",
