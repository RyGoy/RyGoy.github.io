   "message": "If you EVER wonder why I loathe \"believers\" and treat them with the contempt I do, Here is a nice real-world example.\n\nI am an Atheist. I'm hated by every adult with an imaginary friend. If you don't think that's true, then you never moved very far from where you were born.\n\nHere in reality, I run the very real risk of being killed because I'm not a kook with an imaginary friend.\n\nRajib Hayder (who was knifed in the street about a month after these events) was one of my \"fans\".\n\nYour idiotic imaginary friend delusions are hitting close to home. That's why I've been so hostile as of late.\n\nI'M DESCENDED FROM THE VERY PEOPLE WHO CAME UP WITH THE BULLSHIT YOU BELIEVE. \n\nSTOP IT. \n\nNOW.\n\nThe Bible is NOT REAL. It's PRETEND. It's the Noble Lie's Ignorance Recipe Book. That's ALL it EVER was. Needless to say:\n\nTHIS is REQUIRED READING",
