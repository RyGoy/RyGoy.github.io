   "message": "which is pretty funny considering I regularly have proven to me that a higher authority watches out/over for me. twice today as a matter of fact. only have the belief because i am provided proof regularly, proof you wouldnt typically recognize without knowing what/how it presents itself.\n\nI was just drunk traveling home on my 1600cc scooter, stopped at the train depot the next town over to light up a smoke. not a minute passes when a truck officer comes around the bend and asks if everything is ok. yep, fine, just stopping to light a smoke.\nhe said 'thats a nice bike, and i said, well yes and that is a nice truck.' then he turned around and went back.\n\nmust be a camera in the station, because the police station isnt more than a few hundred feet, but down a hill around the bend. he couldnt have known i stopped in there otherwise unless he was hiding stealthily in the shadows.\n\ndidnt ask me for an id or any papers. young kid too....",
