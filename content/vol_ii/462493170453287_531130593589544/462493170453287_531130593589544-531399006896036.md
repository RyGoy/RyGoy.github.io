   "message": "i do not think that there is anything wrong with that. your level of knowledge is far superior to my capacity to pen. I will read that with an open mind, thankyou.\n\ni do agree that there is no God, but there has to be somthing, for if there were nothing there would not be anything.\n\nmy belief lies within the questioning of newtons law of motion, that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. and that an atom at rest requires an outside force to be applied inorder for it to split because it has no potential to do such a thing on its own, otherwise it might just aswell be a rock.\n\ncoupling that with E= creates the conclusion that something equal to the total energy output of the universe may have been converted from one form into another as matter can not be created or destroyed only changed in its form. such a thing requires a form of energy, and that energy was used in a specific manner requiring conscious thought otherwise it would have simply remained dormant like a rock.",
