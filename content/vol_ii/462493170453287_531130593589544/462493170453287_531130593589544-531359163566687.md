The events you describe have nothing to do with \"invisible sky daddies\" , and your conclusion represent a profound inability to critically think.\n\n...so there's NOTHING \"pretty funny\" about that. If you think that \"proved\" that an invisible sky-daddy is watching out for you, then you need to step out of this group and never come back, because the only thing that will possibly happen, is that you leave shit-stains on my forum.\n\nThe profound stupidity necessary to reach the conclusion that \"sky daddy\" is the most reasonable explanation could only come from the brain-damaged  processor, that is the infection of the noble lie.\n\nYou need to start from scratch. You have NO critical thinking ability. The LEAST likely answer is what YOU think is the default position. Do you see the problem here?",
