   "message": "I see that there could be a problem, yet proper handling of any event can lead to certain conclusive outcomes which can be either positive or negative relative toward other events.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking\n\nI do know that the incident that occured last night was mostly within my control to affect a specific outcome based on my capacity to interact with the other party. his intent was to gauge his actions upon my revealing capacity, and that as soon as i spoke he knew somehow that talking to me would lead to his belief being challenged to a point which he could not defend.\n\nmy belief is only within the realm that everyone has the right to accept their own belief, and that substituting an alternate belief without questioning is the fault that lie(s) within a belief renders such a belief to be open to the interpretation of others.\n\nmy belief is only based and founded on those conclusions of outcomes which are founded on my own personal observations through a scientific point of view insomuch that everything that happens has to have some form of energy imparted upon it. otherwise a stone can not move on it's own as it has no will, and inorder for that stone to move some outside force has to interact with it, and since the stone has no eye to see, it must conclude that their is the presence of an outside force. as that is the only logical conclusion nomatter how illogical such a conclusion may be.\n\nspock once said, when all logical options are considered and found not to be true, then that which is illogical must be logical.\n\nthis was proven to me, when one time i was reassembling a dashboard and dropped a screw which i could not find but i knew it had to be there somewhere, it could not have vanished but still it was nowhere to be found, so i dropped another screw to see what would happen, it only reaserted my belief that the illogical must be logical because it had little to no rebound off the carpeting and therfore the first screw mush be there somewhere. i did eventually find it lodged within the seat track above where it had fallen, outside of being viewable, but only after i had concluded that was where it must be, in an illogical position.",
