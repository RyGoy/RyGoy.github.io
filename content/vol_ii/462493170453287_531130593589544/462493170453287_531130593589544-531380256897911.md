   "message": "earlier yesterday in the persute of trading work for exchangeable value i neglected to check the camera mount. the day before i washed the front half of the bike and had removed it. half a mile down the highway something bounced off my right toe and the camera was nolonger on it's perch, i THOUGHT i watched it bounce as i traveled away and the oncoming traffic would take care of it. in any event, i looped around and retraced that step without even so much as locating it. i continued and stopped some 15 miles down the road for a pack of butts and while i was looking for a match i noticed the camera lodged between the rear brake lever and the front exhaust pipe. totally unscathed, intact and functioning ailbet somewhat warm!\n\nthe fact is that if i had tried to put it there and then traveled 80mph for 15 minutes down the bumpy highway it would have been impossible for it to have remained on it's own and not simply vibrated loose because at 80mph my bike shakes like the dickens. it was just sitting there loose with the correct end against the exhaust pipe (not the rubber lens covering) and lying between the brake cylinder bolt and the thin foot lever actuator. if it had turned 90* it would have fallen through.\n\nthe only logical conclusion however illogical must atleast be considered as an available option.\n\nthe affect upon me would have only been the cost to replace the item, which would have made me need more money to spend that i do not readily have at my disposal, and therfore the resulting situation saved me from having to continue to go along with the belief that i dont have enough money to afford to possess those things i want.\n\nIMHO it is not the belief's as we all have a certain ammount of them based upon different experiences, it is the putting those beliefs within the improper realm of where they belong, and/or do not belong.\n\nI believe that i am only along on the train for a ride and not the conductor, but that is also limited within a specific realm, because when i am traveling upon the bike, its handling is totally within my control, and that it is what becomes placed or presented within my path of traveling that is outside of my control requiring the ability to recognize and avoid such things and prevent the chain of events that can cause them to occur within the realm of that which i am in control of.\n\nit is not a belief, but simply something i have learned to accept.",
