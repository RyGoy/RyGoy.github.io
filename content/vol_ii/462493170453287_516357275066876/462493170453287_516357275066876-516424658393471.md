   "message": "Did you make it in Denmark? It doesn't  seem to be possible here, - \"jTinglysing\" is the same as entering judicial information into a registry or public record, and the information then acquires \"legal\" value within the system. That  should be the obvious way of reversing the trust/trustee/beneficiary situation as well as liening the BC, BUT this process has been bound by legislation which prohibits entering anything into the public record except if it is in accordance with very specific terms. Spent all day calling of all the national registries. A lawful way of doing it would be to proclaim it yourself, in writing or in local newspapers, but not so sure about the real-life effect of it.",
