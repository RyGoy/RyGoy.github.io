   "message": "You can create a maritime lien, which does not need to be publicly registered.  \n\nIt is liened into a private trust (which also does not need to be publicly registered because it is private).  \n\nYou then issue a public notice (newspaper notice, notice to government etc) that the above processes have taken place ie:  The BC with details ??? has been liened into a private trust.\n\nAny further details are private, which is the beauty of the process...only parties to the BC and or trust have any standing...anyone else, it's none of their business because it's private...\n\nTo paraphrase from a previous thread:\n\n1: Establish a trust\n\n2: Establish a corporation - In the Charter, assign the role of the corporation to HOLD the trust, and establish the \"Law\" guidelines (You get to make your own up) as regards keeping the trust.\n\n3: Get ANY accountant to manage the books of the corporation. You direct the corporation as FIRST DIRECTOR, and establish roles (President/CEO Vice President, etc) which is how the UNITED STATES was formed. \n\nThe accountant EXECUTES YOUR TASKS within the framework. To establish a trust, write it down, and have it witnessed and notarized. The end. Only shareholders of your corporation are recognized by the trust.\n\nrun this by Scott Duncan for confirmation/ to clarify details.",
