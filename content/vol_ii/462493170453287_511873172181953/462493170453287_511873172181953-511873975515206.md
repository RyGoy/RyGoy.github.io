   "message": "Just reminded me of the time I slapped a random plate on my insured car to take my daughter to the movies. I get pulled over and the cop says \"how did you get insurance without registration?\" I just looked at his crooked teeth and thought, \"WHAT? DO YOU RIDE YOUR BIKE TO WORK EVERYDAY?\" Not to mention the last encounter with a break in the neighbors place... he says, \"Well we're overworked and underpaid.\"... of course you are! YOU ARE AN IDIOT!",
