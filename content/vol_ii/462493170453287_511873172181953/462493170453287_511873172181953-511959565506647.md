   "message": "I like the etymological definition of 'authority'.    Certainly to be an author make one an authority.  One's word is the law and if you write it down you 'authorize' it....and stand on it...understand it because you hold it above you...above your temporary urges that may want you to disregard your promises.  If you say so and write so you should back it up with full liability...unto  death.  To 'stand' on another's writing is ridiculous and irresoponsable....in my opinion.  You can make another's 'law' your law and that is contract....an agreement...a mutual understanding for a defined and limited purpose...but never as a universal acceptance granting them 'authority' over you.  This is why anyone wearing a uniform and obeying a book or code or 'act' is not an authority at all.  How could they be?  They didn't write it.  Of course the other root of authority is the term for gold...the word is as good as gold....AU is the periodic table of element's symbol for gold and words like aura....and even austere...pertain to ultimate value.",
