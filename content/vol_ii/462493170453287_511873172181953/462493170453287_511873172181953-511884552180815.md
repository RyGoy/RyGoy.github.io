   "message": "�The term �authority,� like the term �contract,� may easily be used in three senses, and is therefore a term to be avoided when accurate reasoning is desirable. It may be used to mean (1) the operative acts of the principal, (2) a physical document executed by the principal, or (3) the legal relations consequent upon the preceding operative facts (1) and (2), and especially the legal power conferred upon the agent to bring the principal into new legal relations without any further action by the principal. The operative facts may be spoken words, a document together with the acts necessary to execute it, or other conduct by the principal apparently expressing an intention to create a power. Hereafter, the word �authority� will be used to denote these operative facts; in other cases the word power will usually be substituted. This latter word is not so likely to be taken in shifting senses, in spite of the fact that �power of attorney� generally means a physical document under seal.�",
