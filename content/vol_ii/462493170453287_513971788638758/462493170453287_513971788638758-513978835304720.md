   "message": "OK...I feel Belligerent this morning, so I'm going to reveal some truths HAHAHAHA!\n\n(1) There is no law that requires you to produce a tax return. I've read about 20 times this document, and this is not a law. Indeed it is written in the document itself that this law is not a law. ;/, here is word for word what is written: the word law in this document, includes one law other than a law of the Parliament of Quebec.\n\n(2) This means simply and naively that there is no law on the tax:D\n\n(3) The income tax act is a regulation aimed at employees of the Government of Qu�bec Inc. Therefore, if you work for them, you must submit you this has, but if you do not work for them, you do not have submit you this regulation, any more than you have submit you the settlement of Coca Cola or Walt-Mart.\n\n(4) Please note that I do not go out this information for my BELIEFS or I do not know too much... this info is verified and true. If you don't believe call me revenue Qu�bec and ask their: D, ask them to send you a copy certified and signed an act any which requires you have pay tax. and good luck!...: D ooops... and ask them to send you in writing what they do with your tax.\n\n(5) I AM NOT AGAINST THE SYSTEM. I just want to obey a law, because all must obey a law, me, you and the system...ALL are equal before the law, policeman, plumber, judges, lawyers, Mayor, me and you.",
