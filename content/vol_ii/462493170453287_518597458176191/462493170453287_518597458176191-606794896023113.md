THAT\"S A NEW \"DEAN KORY\" THAT WAS CREATED, AND THAT \"YOU\" RESPONDED TO!\" - Scott\n\nI have a couple questions because my mind tends to \"picture\" things as I read them and can then lead me to understand them incorrectly or not at all...\n\nWhen you say they create a new person, because I'm still thinking a wee bit wrong :p, I picture the birth registration process. Obviously this isn't what happens in this instance though. So in what way do they create a new person?\n\n Is it simply a case of creating a name the unsuspecting party responds to and creating joinder with it? (Typically the name the unsuspecting man gives)\n\n Is that all it takes to create a person for the purposes of a security instrument?\n\nAnd, I hate to ask but, what definition of the word person are you using above?\n\nCheers for your time",
