   "message": "Eamonn, Scott makes reference to Dean Otf Kory's case. He was charged with something first. Then he got charged with different charges a next time. Every time there is a new charge, each needs to be addressed as \"charge= new person= surety needs to be established and settled asap\".\n\nSo for example, sometimes in proceedings the crown/prosecutor will change the charges while in court, adding more, or replacing previous charges with others. Every time there is a new charge, you need to take of that charge, regardless that you had use the NoM previously to discharge/settle the accounting for other charges.\n\nI hope that helps you clear the matter.",
