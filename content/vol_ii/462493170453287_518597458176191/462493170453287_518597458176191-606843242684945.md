   "message": "Yes Pete� I hear you.\nI got away without identifying myself and with 2 tickets�\nat least 9 cop cars and paddy wagons left the scene directly after. I did not know I was surrounded by so many�\nVehicle was insured and registered they made the tickets out to that name. Which was not anything to do with me.\nLiability went to the owner of the vehicle. \nI was free to go�  that is all that mattered to me at that moment as the person given to me to hold at 2 days after its creation in my back pocket has some warrants to be administrated.   \nThe cop even said to me�\"oh your that tv guy�\"\nit was an odd experience to which in previous encounters I have always been detained. So it was a minor win in my view. I drove way free. I did not have to spend any time in cells or get vehicle out of impound again� I read the public notice and did not consent \ncop said \" it does not matter\" and stuffed ticket in my hand and refused my invoice � \n Live and learn. :-P",
