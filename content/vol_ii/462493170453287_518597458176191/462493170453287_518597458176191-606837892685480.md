   "message": "Excuse me sir but may I know with whom I am dealing?May I see your identification including your birthday and address?  if we are to engage in commerce I need to know with whom I am dealing so I can bill it properly as per the public notice I happen to have right hereï¿½ It clearly states that I am a legal private entity  with specific terms to engage with you. By forcibly engaging me you have accepted the terms  of the public notice leaving me no alternative but to pursue this to the full extent of the private contract you have just engaged in by detaining me against my will. We call that kidnapping and if any sort of violence is used , since you are armed that will be attempted murder.  Or just take the ticket and remain in honour and administrate it.   \nIdeally if one can keep their head.  \nHowever they think it is their right to forcibly confine us.. \nso back top appealing to the rapist thing :-P",
