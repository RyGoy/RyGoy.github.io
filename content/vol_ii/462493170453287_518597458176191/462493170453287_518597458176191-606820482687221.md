   "message": "I find funny, not to say stupid, that some want to pick the worst scenarios to \"put to test our knowledge\". Try this shit out in a traffic stop? Sounds like a Dean Clifford technique to me. A best and more fun scenario, althought this is not a real proposition (wink wink), would be for someone (never me of course ;) ) to shoot a non-prorouged evil noble in the balls, and watch him bleed to death... While holding the NoM in one hand, and a gun in the other. I'm just sayin'. Thats the way to do it!",
