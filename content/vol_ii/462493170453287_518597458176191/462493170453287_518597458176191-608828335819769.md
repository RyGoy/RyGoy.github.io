   "message": "If you give the name/birth date/address, even if you try to play dumb with the capacity, YOU are providing them, YOURSELF, with enough evidence (in their training) to be treated as their bitch.\n\nI guess if you are just getting a ticket, and have no standing warrants, they will just issue tickets/citations for not having the driver license with YOU. If you can live with that, not a bad option.  \n\nYet, every encounter with these psycos is an invitation for potential disaster. I've seen videos of people getting killed in \"routine stops\" for nothing. Why take the risk?\n\nOr they will arrest YOU, depending on the jurisdiction, like Orlando, Florida.\n\nThe NAME means FUCK ME, please. That has been clearly covered at TT4L.",
