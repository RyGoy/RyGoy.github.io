   "message": "I don't get it!!!  If \"Dean Kory\" kills a member of my family he can't be held accountable before a court of law in this country because of some obscure wording in the laws of this country? \n\nAre you guys all out to lunch or are you all just hopping that you're never the victim of a crime left HOPING FOR JUSTICE. Is all this in the hope of creating anarchy?\n\nI was under the impression that this page was for serious discussions of legal and political ramifications of laws but instead I am faced with discussions on how to NOT get fined or convicted of being too stupid to have a drivers license, for example.\n\nI think you're all hyper focused on what the government does wrong at the expense of the fact that your fellow citizens,  brother, sister, parents, might not want to share the road, or have their children play nearby a road where someone too STUPID to retain something as simple as a drivers license drives by.\n\nI agree that we as a country go overboard with a lot of laws and I also agree that most of our politicians are bought and payed COWARDS but lets not go overboard and protect the stupid from being held accountable.",
