   "message": "SHIT STAIN REMOVAL (Fuck those are ugly babies!):\n\nA NAME is not a corporation, any more than it's an animal, or a plant. Try eating the word \"apple\" as your diet, until that concept sinks in. You might want to consume the word \"multivitamin\" to NOT supplement your non-diet, until you clue in.\n\nA CORPORATION is CHARTERED AND ENDORSED BY GRANTORS (GRANTOR PARTIES and GOVERNMENT = CORPORATION = PERSON), and have the following:\n\nSHAREHOLDERS\nA FIRST DIRECTOR\nA COMMERCIAL NAME\n\nYOU are contracting for ANOTHER corporation (HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF *ADMINISTRATIVE ZONE NAME HERE*) and assuming surety for it. THIS CREATES A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT WHICH YOU CONSENT TO... because you are IDENTIFYING YOURSELF as a CORPORATE TRUSTEE AND CREATING AN ACCOUNT TO BE BILLED! YOU ARE ACTING AS A TRUSTEE AND NOT A CORPORATION!\n\nIt does not matter why the guy with the ugly babies is lying to you, just accept that he is.",
