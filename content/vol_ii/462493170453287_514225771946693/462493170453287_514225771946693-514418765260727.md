   "message": "HERE IN REALTY: The FBI and the SECRET SERVICE (All part of \"Homeland Security\") have targeted MT.GOX [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt.Gox], which is the world's largest exchange. It would be like the New York Stock Exchange being frozen: No MONEY is really touched. You still own Microsoft stock, if an exchange goes down. You just have to sell elsewhere. They are targeting the points where BTC becomes USD (Bitcoins become US Dollars). There will be panic selling;ALL BASED ON IGNORANCE! EXPLOIT IT!\n\n...because this has NOTHING to do with Bitcoin. 2+2 STILL equals 4. If you checked recently, you will notice that ALL math was unaffected by this news. :D Same with Bitcoin... IT HASN'T CHANGED. SAME ECONOMIC PROPERTIES AS GOLD WITHOUT THE MASS!\n\nLEARN WAHT MONEY IS, and you will TRULY see how futile these attacks are! :D",
