You WANT your children to be safe, don't you? GOOD!\n\nIf you see (or think you see) a \"Non-White-Supremacist Aboriginal Paperwork Domestic Terrorist\"., DO NOT APPROACH THEM! Call your local RCMP detachment or any local Rothschild bank! DO NOT TALK TO THEM. If you do, your children will be UNSAFE!\n\nYou don't support UNSAFETYNESS for your CHILDREN do you? If you don't, then you will never talk to those \"Non-White-Supremacist Aboriginal Paperwork Domestic Terrorist\".... or anyone we deem a \"Domestic Threat\".\n\nWe're the Government. We're here to help. :D",
