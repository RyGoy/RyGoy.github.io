   "message": "Hey, Scott and Tara, I just want to say that I've spent lots of time in here, and, so far, in these past 47 years, I never received that much value for my TIME. \nI can say that I have done crazy things in my life, some good and lots of bad, and I ALWAYS paid a bill for each of them. \n\nSo I�m wondering, all that valuable stuff I�ve picked up in here, are they REALLY free ?, I mean should I expect a bill ?, :D , I am no dupe, I KNOW there is NOTHING free.  \nIf, indeed, the ONLY price I need to pay for all this, is my TIME, well, this is the first TIME that my time has been so well invested.\n\nSorry if I ever made you mad and/or sad with any of my comments, and, of course, this TOKEN accent I have\n\nPete\nMaster of PIERRE DAOUST",
