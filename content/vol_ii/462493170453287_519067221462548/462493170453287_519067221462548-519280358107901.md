   "message": "Interesting David. Is Scott not interested in commenting on this subject? All the other comments are not exactly answering the question I pose. David has a very good point. I have been asked by quite a few expecting parents what purpose the registration of a baby fills/serves. It is not something that is spoken about much. The only things I have heard are; 1) That it is a recording of an event and proof of a share in the resources of the land mass one is born to. 2) That registration poses an obligation to the registrar party to \"protect\" and \"serve\" the registered to their best interest and benefit. 3) That it is a forming of a Trust (which I think is the same as #2 put simpler)",
