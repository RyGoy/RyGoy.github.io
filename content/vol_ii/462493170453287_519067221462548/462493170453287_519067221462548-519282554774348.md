   "message": "Before the formation of a Trust between a registrar and the parents, the baby was obviously entrusted to the mother and father by law of nature. It would negate to me then that as mother and father (assuming the child is not being harmed) they have ultimate ruling over what IS best for the child and as long as they are willing to speak to each other (even if only the mother OR father is willing) then there is no place for a third party to intervene. The only intervention, that may be necessary (possibly having to use force), would be to bring the unwilling party to the table of discussion.",
