   "message": "MONEY: Money is the measure by which goods are valued, the value by which goods are exchanged, and in which Contracts are made payable. Everything receives a value from itï¿½s use, and the value is raised, according to its Quality, Quantity, and Demand. Money is not the value for which goods are exchanged, but the value by which they are exchanged. (John Law, political economist, 1705).",
