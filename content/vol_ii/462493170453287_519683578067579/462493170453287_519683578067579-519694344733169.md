   "message": "One thing about the movie 'Minority Report' that has always stuck with me, is when Tom Cruise was handed what looked like a credit-card. Though the value of it wasnt described in terms of how many DOLLARS it was worth, he was told how many \"CREDITS\" it was worth...of course that was a decade ago, and didnt know why at the time that struck me strange- BUT, i didnt know Scott Duncan at the time either",
