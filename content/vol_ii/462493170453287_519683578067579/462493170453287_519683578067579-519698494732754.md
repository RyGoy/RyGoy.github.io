Let me try again...\n\n*sigh*\n\nOk. Please pay attention to the question posed:\n\nWHAT IS REAL MONEY?\n\nThat is all you need to focus on... \n\nNot the clubhouse rules\nNot shit strangers BELIEVE is money\nNot debt-based FIAT notes\n\nNOTHING LIKE THAT.\n\nJust the question of fact: WHAT IS REAL MONEY?\n\n****\n\nNow I really need you to read that CAREFULLY.
