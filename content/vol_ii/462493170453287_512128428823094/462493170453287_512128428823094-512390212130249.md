   "message": "AND..this gave me an idea. Listening to those guys all talk-over each other is fucking PAINFUL. The LISTEN-TO-THE-ADMIRAL SHOW with Scott Duncan, should advertise the show-topic a week in advance with questions taken and reviewed for the actual show. The show will NOT be live, these fucking callers seem to love NOT to listen but to speak-over those they are seeking advice from. Questions would be able to be answered then, in a succinct, deliberate delivery, with no worry about some caller-INSURGENT breaking the hosts train-of-thought. Then, said show would simply be uploaded and in the future if somone asks the same question for the hundredth time, you Scott can simply point out to them- \"I did a WHOLE FUCKING SHOW ON IT..i even NAMED the fucking show after the same question you just ASKED ME- fuck, p.s......i hate you all\"",
