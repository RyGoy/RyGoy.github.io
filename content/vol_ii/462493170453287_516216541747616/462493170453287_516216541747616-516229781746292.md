   "message": "yes, that thought crossed my mind about \"orders\" here is a quote at the bottom of the \"order\" : \"OFFENCE - A person is guilty of an offence if the person fails to comply with an order, direction or other requirement made under the BUILDING CODE ACT, 1992. A person who is convicted of an offence is liable to a fine of not more than $25,000 for a first offence and to a fine of not more than $50,000 for a subsequent offence. Subsection 36 (1) (b) and 36 (3).\" ...my thoughts...how much should I charge to honour this order?? lol",
