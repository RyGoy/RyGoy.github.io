   "message": "So... what about being a \"permanent resident\" under jus soli to enact and ensure jus cogens...making one a \"non-national\"...yet retaining one's fundamental rights. The court woukd have to prorve that I am a \"sworn\" citizen who has either made an oath or pledge of some kind....which I for one have not done...because I am not a vassal, nor am I an official taking any specific title, occupation or role,  and as such am not privy to any \"dominitus\" associations with anyone. My domicile asserts this residency and ensures my Right of Abode for...� physical .presence in a state is an important factor. Some states also determine residency of an individual by reference to a variety of other factors, such as the ownership of a home or availability of accommodation, family, and financial interests\". I have NOT made any oath or allegiance with anyone, and personally I have never applied for oir recieved a birth CERTIFICATE. Luck me?\nAlso...my \"vessel\" that brought me here...was at best a �landed immigrant\" so I dont see how they could claim jurisdiction over me thru any \"oaths\" \"pledges\", \"allegiances\" or \"affirmations\" that I never made personally.",
