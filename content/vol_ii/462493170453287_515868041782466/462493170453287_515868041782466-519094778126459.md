   "message": "Hi guys I have been researching NZ Legislation trying to find out if we have anything here that resembles the Ontario Change of Name Act or if there is anything else here that is close to this particular Act - Nothing exists here covering the use of the name on Birth Cert's or any benefits attached to it....have so far managed to escape the courts clutches regarding non payment of company/personal Income Taxes but they tried to get me on failing to file company/personal Income Tax forms for past 10yrs - I managed to get judge to acknowledge the all caps name was not the same as on my BC (in NZ given names are written in upper and lower case) not capitalised as on all summons and court documents, but because the all caps identity wasn't in court the accusers (IRD) can re PRESENT the case back to court and prosecute in its absence which they did - now they have sent documents in upper and lower case name telling me that fines were imposed and that an attachment order has gone to my bank and they will be deducting money from the bank account - I want to use your \"Give in lieu of identification\" notice but not sure what to Write in place of the ontario change of name act, as Like I said above we have nothing similar in NZ legislation/law. Any help/suggestions gratefully accepted, since my court appearence they are now addressing all mail/correspondence in my upper/lower case name, thereby trying to create joinder.",
