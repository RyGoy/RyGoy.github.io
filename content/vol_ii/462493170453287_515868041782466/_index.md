   "message": "The PERSON/INDIVIDUAL/Having, or NOT having, to IDENTIFY yourself to a Police Officer- thread.....\n\nThe Police Officers Manual of Criminal Law and Criminal Offences 2000's definition of PERSON, is a tad different than the one they provide for US in the Criminal Code, as you'll see here:\n\nPERSON. 1. The scope of \"person\" as set out in s.2 of the Criminal Code R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 extends somewhat beyond the individual, covering additionally public bodies, corporations, societies and companies, but, groups having common characteristics such as race, religion, colour and ethnic origin ARE NOT included in the definition (R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697) 2. The term, as used in s. 203 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 is SYNONOMOUS with the term \"human being\" (R. v. Sullivan, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 3. In the context of s. 11(b) of the Charter includes CORPORATIONS (R. v. *photocopy blurs here* Inc., [1992] 1 S.C.R. 843) 4. \"Persons are of two classes only - natural persons and legal persons. A natural person is a human being, that has the capacity for rights or duties. A legal person is anything to which the law gives a legal or fictitious existence and personality, with capacity for rights and duties. The ONLY legal person known to our law is the CORPORATION - the BODY CORPORATE\" (Hague v. Cancer Relief & Research Institute, [1939] 4 D.L.?*blurry* (Man. K.B.)).\n\nDerek Moran: Maxim-of-Law: Man(homo) is a term of nature; person(persona) is a CIVIL term.\n\nScott Duncan: ONLY A \"PERSON\" CAN BUY ANYTHING.\n\nScott Duncan:  The group is called THE TENDER FOR LAW, not THE TENDER FOR BULLSHIT. That's Robert Menard's group.\n\nPERSON is a LEGAL term for EQUITY. No \"sea monsters\" and no bullshit.\n\nYOU ARE NOT A PERSON, you HAVE a person.\n\nDerek Moran: ..wheres Fukyiro when'ya need her\n\nScott Duncan: OMFG..I was drinking coffee when I read that\n\nDerek Moran:  LMAO.. did it go out your nose?\n\nScott Duncan: ...now I have to clean up.\n\nDerek Moran: Article 6.\n\nEveryone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.\n\nhttp://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/\n\nEamonn O Brien: To understand the PERSON better one should probably equate it to one's penis... I don't want to use it until I want to use it... etc...\n\nDerek Moran: ..and i suspect if you have the RIGHT to recognition as a person before the law, then; you would also have the right to WAIVE that right if the legal-system is trying to use the term PERSON to screw you with it ?\n\nEamonn O Brien: DC touched on that subject... It's not a question of being recognised as the person though... Transfer the right to them, let them use it if they want...\n\nScott Duncan:  In ONTARIO? I gotcha covered!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/scott-duncan/give-in-lieu-of-identification/513494008717076\n\nDerek Moran: Scott mentioned in another thread about PERSON in the Criminal Code: its either \"Her Majesty,\" or an \"organization\"...which one AM I?? \n\nDaslow Aizelasi: In the CCC EVERY ONE is \"her majesty\" or an organization\nthe Interpretation Act defines a �PERSON� �(ncludes a corporation and the heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives of a person to whom the context can apply according to law.� The Interpretation act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 11, s. 29(1)\nthe Canadian Law Dictionary defines an \"artificial person\" as is not a human being but is known as a person by law to whom rights and duties may attach\n\nThis passage is from SALHANYS Police Manual about having to IDENTIFY yourself...\n\n\"The common law does not require a citizen to identify oneself or carry identification of any sort...\" Koechlin v. Waugh, (1957), 118 C.C.C. 24 (Ont C.A.).... and ....\"...the common law has never considered it an offence of obstruction for a person to refuse to identify oneself and thus prevent a police officer from carrying out his or her general duties to investigate crimes.\" As was noted by Lord Parker, Chief Justice of England in Rice v. Connolly, [1966] 2 Q.B. 414 (Eng. Div. Ct.) at pg. 419:\n\nhttp://www.carswell.com/product-detail/salhanys-police-manual-of-arrest-seizure-and-interrogation-tenth-edition-formerly-the-police-manual-of-arrest-seizure-and-interrogation/\n\ncheck page/section 610 of this case from 1960, Supreme Court defines what exactly is meant by the designation our public-servants give us when using the term 'INDIVIDUAL'\n\nhttp://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=definition+of+individual&language=en&searchTitle=Canada+%28Federal%29+-+Supreme+Court+of+Canada&path=%2Fen%2Fca%2Fscc%2Fdoc%2F1960%2F1960canlii62%2F1960canlii62.html\n\nScott Duncan: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\nOH FUCK THE LAW SLAYS ME!\n\nLMAO!\n\n...i think I just hurt myself laughing.\n\nDerek Moran: Ontario Court of Justice - Provincial Offences: \"There are three different types of Provincial Offence Notices.
