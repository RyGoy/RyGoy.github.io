   "message": "FUN FACTS ABOUT JESUS:\n\nJesus was a RAPE BABY who grew up to be a carpenter. He said, \"Those who live by the sword, shall die by the sword\", and because he was a carpenter, he drove the point home by getting himself nailed to two planks of wood.\n\nThen he \"Died for our sins\"...but he didn't actually die. He was resurrected 3 days later...so he had a bad weekend for your sins... and he slept through most of it. Nobody can reach consensus on what \"sin\" is, but Jesus had a bad weekend for it.\n\nFUN FACT:There are \"christians\" who think I should be killed for what I just wrote.",
