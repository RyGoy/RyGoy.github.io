   "message": "Yes, Mike and Martin, \"segue\" is misspelled.  More to the point, people assume because it looks and sounds familiar it is used correctly.  It is not.

I regret there are only bonus points for this exercise; next time perhaps we should go for something more impressive like a Shrap sound system, or an Eyepod.",
