Well, not exactly an Eyepod, it's a trEYEpod mini.\n\nSome persons just doesn't get the idea that it is a headache trying to decipher(why isn't it decypher???) or maybe I should say decrypt, some of the things that people type up. You may think that you put in some effort in writing, but if people have to struggle to understand what you are writing, you are a failure as a writer. Isn't there a maxim: \"Seek first to understand, then to be understood\"? Pretty sure bad writing proves failure on both points. Nor is it respectful to the reader.\n\nP.S. person(s) and people were not chosen arbitrarily.",
