   "message": "I am glad I was presented the opportunity to read and fully comprehend the nature of Tara's treatise. She is correct when she refers to the possibility of World War 3 having its beginnings by way of the incorrect appropriation in choice of parlance utilised. The insertion of what one may deem as a mere colloquialism may in fact result in offence being taken by an opposing party. I have taken note of her strongly, and well made points and will most assuredly make all possible attempts to ensure my wording is correct and acceptable given the cultural nuances of those that make postings here. Thank you Tara. However, I do admit, your posting was enjoyable to read, though if it was given as oratory I may well have been given to lapsing into the realm of Morpheus.",
