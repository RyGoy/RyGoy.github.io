The majority of you are adults with imaginary friends who try to attach these things you learn to your delusions (God, Jesus, Spirits, etc) so doing it for you, the reader, is a futile task.\n\nYou miss all the BIG things and focus on \"clubhouse rules\" (even though you aren't in the club) and miss the MOST important lesson because you love bullshit...a LOT.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT LESSON: ALL BELIEF IS EVIL. ALL OF IT. The very act of BELIEVING is evil. Once you ditch THAT bullshit, THEN you'll be ready to actually LEARN something.",
