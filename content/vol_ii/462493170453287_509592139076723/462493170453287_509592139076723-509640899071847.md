   "message": "I totally get what Tara is trying to say and in a perfect world this wouldn't even be an issue. However we are a social forum and sometimes with limited time and limited understanding. I wouldn't hold people near as accountable here, especially for the most part when we all understand or have an understanding of what is meant. Where I do have a problem is when the Social Worker can't even spell my name right in her paper work, especially after I have been dealing wither for the last 18 months. I think that there are all sorts of reasons why there are spelling mistakes, it  isn't  that important here. And I think, that it is amazing that Joseph Pierre Gilles has a good command of the English language, I would hate to try and start to write anything in French.",
