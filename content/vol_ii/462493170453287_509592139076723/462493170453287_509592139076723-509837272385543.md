   "message": "I think that we can all agree that language is important and if we can we should do our best to use it as correctly as possible. However sometimes we are rushed, or mistype and take a look at where we are FACEBOOK. I think that picking on people's spelling and grammatical use of words is nit picking. We all know why we are here, for a reason: to learn. Not all of us are endowed with the ability to make words flow or be spelled correctly or used correctly. Get over it and quite being so critical of people in that respect.",
