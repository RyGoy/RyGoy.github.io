   "message": "Gerry, the stones were merely an analogy, nothing more. To oft we digress when we delve into an example, and forget rhe original POV being expressed. I was simply pointing out that the OP, albeit correct in its suppositions, was also containing examples of said transgressions. Scott \"clarified\" these deliberate \"errors\" (alrhough the half use of quotation marks, and parentheses, for example, tend to make me wonder about that...jus sayin).\n\nYiu maje a good point as well... \"coined phrases\" and \"terms of the day\" often butcher language, especially when serious intellectual discussions are haopening. \"Blog talk\" often resukts, where we iften fyoe as we talk. But...we aren't talking verbal lyso written dictums must prevail.\n\n We need to write concisely, and pay attention to what we say and how we say it...because we arent yokel okles talking about sheep fucking by the outhouse or water hole. And thats hiw we treat our host when we fuck around and write like jerk offs. And expext our comments to be respected and accepted when we are rude by our lack of dilligence.\nPoint noted and taken! \nI apologize for mine, for many if mine are due to fucking technology! And my inability to use it pateintly shit. sorry cell is freezing s",
