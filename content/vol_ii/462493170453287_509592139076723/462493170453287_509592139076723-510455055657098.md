Still does effect me.\nI wanted to experience a different pain & I'd much prefer a piercing over HEART PAIN &/OR BROKEN HEART PAIN.\nThe lafies flocked to me & I had a harem going for some time until I fell in love with a MUTT.....\nWE had a child together & I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THAT MUTT FOR BRINGING OUR LIBERTY INTO OUR WORLD & LIVES.\nAS MY NEW TATTOOS SAY PIERRE.\n   L I B E R T Y  OR D E A T H",
