   "message": "A few words on language\n\nAs I peruse the hallowed forums of people struggling to comprehend what they view as complex concepts and truths I read your comments and questions...and it hurts.  I frequently can't even get past the misuse of words and grammar to evaluate the message you are attempting to convey.\n\nThere is right and wrong, up and down, on and off.  How can you hope to master the complex when you are working with the comprehension and writing skills of gerbils?  Why do so few know the difference between \"there\", and \"their\", and \"they're\"?  These are completely different words and concepts.  There are applications which offer grammatical advice, and most applications automatically check your spelling.  When the helpful suggestions appear on your screen do you automatically think to yourself, \"Screw this, my writing is too unique and special to be subjected to grammatical scrutiny?  Don't bother to blame anything on \"typing too fast\".  It takes the same amount of time to type something incorrectly as it does to get it right.  Unless you're willing to blame the post on the interference of children or unruly pets, you pressed the \"send\" button.\n\nAssuming you're not all disciples of ee cummings, what is your philosophical objection to starting a sentence with a capital letter, or ending it with punctuation?  Why do you use an apostrophe only when it is absolutely the wrong place to put it?  \"Its\" is possessive, \"it's\" takes two words and contracts them.  People should be described in numbers and not amounts (unless you're making some seriously fucked-up soufflï¿½).  If you understand how something can be ruled out, explain to me how you can \"rule it in\"?  Context is important.  \"I read your email\" is not necessarily the same as \"I read your email yesterday\".  How can you hope to understand complex concepts when you are building on a foundation devoid of the basic building blocks of language?\n\nIf you think the snotty bitch is ridiculing your typographical errors you may be thinking, \"What makes her think she's better than me\"?  I'll save you the trouble by finishing your sentence which could also read, \"What makes her think she's better than me am\"?\n\nI don't take offence when people correct my grammar - I sometimes make mistakes and I prefer to be as accurate as possible in my communication.  This doesn't mean I don't occasionally feel stupid as a result; I just try not to take it too personally.  You may not feel this way.  You may think having attention drawn to your errors is rude or mean-spirited.  Your position is invariably, \"Don't be an ass...you know what I mean.\"  Actually I don't.  \n\nIn order to communicate with you in writing I must first read the sentence, mentally correct the spelling mistakes, attempt to determine if the simple and complex words you are using actually mean what you think they mean.  Along the way there may be a requirement to attempt to determine the overlay of gender-bias, humour or lack thereof, or cultural nuance.  On occasion I must ask for clarification regarding the question or point you pose; and from time-to-time mentally deal with my annoyance at your response of, \"Your an idiot\".  To add insult to injury, you are the very people who deem my writing inaccessible.\n\nYou make me laugh when you ponder learning another language, when you demonstrably can't correctly use the one you have.  While we in Canada embrace multiculturalism and find people with bad communication skills charming, or deserving of our pity, the misuse of words in other languages, in other parts of the world, could actually get you killed.\n\nIn a not-too-clever segway, I remind you that wars have been fought over the misuse, or misunderstanding, of words.  If you think precision in communication is unimportant, I strongly suggest you avoid careers in the field of science, law, engineering, anything involving electricity.\n\n\"If I don't like it go somewhere else?\"  Well, let's see.  These are our forums...and where else is there to go if you are the best the Internet has to offer?\n\nFeel free to comment on this if you feel you are being unfairly evaluated.  If you respond carefully you might just learn something. If you choose to comment be advised your responses will be graded for content and correctness.  There will be bonus points for anyone who can find errors in this post.\n\nThe abuse will continue until the cheese is returned.",
