   "message": "\"If you think the snotty bitch is ridiculing your typographical errors you may be thinking, \"What makes her think she's better than me\"?\"\n\n\"You make me laugh when you ponder learning another language, when you demonstrably can't correctly use the one you have.\"\n\nWhile I can't say those sentences are necessarily wrong they don't seem to \"flow right\", although maybe technically correct.  I even checked with online grammar checkers but have no idea how good those things are and have never used them before.  The checkers approved both sentences.  Using \"when\" twice in the 2nd one seems little odd to me.  For a legal document this may not matter.",
