Like you even stand a chance of holding her attention long enough to receive those! :D\n\nBwahahahaha *air* hahahahaha! \n\nhere's the thing Adam: I am notorious for being adept at the fine art of stealing a woman's heart. I mastered it decades ago ( I can't believe I can even say \"decades\" in that context!) through a complete understanding of women. I also know that their hearts are fleeting, so their focus CAN be swayed. You might have a chance distracting a woman who's heart I've stolen...\n\n...but Tara Duncan gave hers willingly ;)",
