   "message": "take 3 ? I see Scott is about, no need to beat me up over take two, it has been agreed that my rude sarcasm and format was not going to fly...swing away on this one though, if you have time, i think I have it right, sorry for sucking up so much space, hopefully it helps with other endeavors some are going through:\nNOTICE\n \nWITH ALL RIGHTS RESERVED, AT ALL TIMES, for the man, Kelleran Holman,\nreferred below as \"I\", \"me\", myself\", and \"man\" \n\nre:\"ORDER TO REMEDY \nNON-CONFORMITY WITH STANDARDS \nFOR MAINTENANCE AND OCCUPANCY\"\nReference Number 5-14-2013\nDATED:inspection MAY 14,2013\n\n   To, PROPERTY STANDARDS COMMITTEE, xxx xxxx: Property Standards Officer, and all agents of THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX\n\nRegarding your offer of May 16, 2013 (original attached).\n\nRETURNED, NO CONSENT, NO CONTRACT \n\nREQUIRED ACTION:\n\n1)Provide the dually signed contract and/or current employment records, that show I, and/or the man known as xxx xx has an obligation to the CORPORATION OF ESSEX, and,\n\n2)Provide the EVIDENCE you are relying on that I, or the MAN known as xxx xx, have harmed, damaged or infringed on another human beings rights or property, as we are of the understanding that none exist, please provide the verified sworn/affirmed complaint, as I have not had an opportunity to hear or see a verified complaint. Who am I harming exactly, and how?\n\n3)Provide proof, and/or first hand knowledge that I, and/or the man known as xxx xx have been given full disclosure to the terms of our alleged relationship with, THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, and had thus given consent to be governed by, THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, or,\n\n4)Send an apology letter, and/or never contact me again.\n\nI am unable to \"COMPLY\" with your \"ORDER\" at this time, as I do NOT UNDERSTAND the nature of the order, or how I as a MAN, with a COMMON LAW CLAIM OF RIGHT to ALL the property at the location known as 9577 Walker rd Mcgregor, have ANY obligation to, and/or contracts with the CORPORATION OF ESSEX, do any exist?\n\nBY-LAWS are simply put, whether defined in Bouviers, or Blacks law dictionaries as; \"Rules of a corporation for THEIR OWN internal governance.\" ...Therefore, I would have to have consented to, or be employed with, your \"CORPORATION\", to the best of my knowledge, I AM NEITHER, is there evidence to the contrary?\n\n[I have read the cited by-laws, and all references are for \"PERSONS\". The definition section of the by-law and/or codes cited, does NOT properly identify \"PERSON\" as a man, woman, human being, nor does it even mention \"NATURAL PERSON\" for that matter, ANY use of the LEGAL person is PURELY, and ONLY, out of PRIVATE NECESSITY ,] What evidence do you have that I am in fact a \"person\" from the by-law/codes cited?\neg: The Police Officers Manual of Criminal Law and Criminal Offences 2000's definition of  PERSON\n\nPERSON. 1. The scope of \"person\" as set out in s.2 of the Criminal Code R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 extends somewhat beyond the individual, covering additionally public bodies, corporations, societies and companies, but, groups having common characteristics such as race, religion, colour and ethnic origin ARE NOT included in the definition (R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697)\n\n \"Persons are of two classes only - natural persons and legal persons. A natural person is a human being, that has the capacity for rights or duties. A legal person is anything to which the law gives a legal or fictitious existence and personality, with capacity for rights and duties. The ONLY legal person known to our law is the CORPORATION - the BODY CORPORATE\" (Hague v. Cancer Relief & Research Institute, [1939] 4 D.L.?*blurry* (Man. K.B.)).\n\n   The phone conversation on or about May 10, 2013, with xxx xxxx, I was very clear, with regards to \"TRESPASSING\" on \"PRIVATE PROPERTY\" (the signs posted should have also been sufficient notice), and xxx xxxx, referred to his BADGE as allowing him to do whatever he wanted, and it appears, trespassed, on TWO occasions. LEGALLY, xxx xxxx may be correct, however, LAWFULLY, I LIVE  in, and claim natural COMMON LAW  jurisdiction, with ALL my inherent rights, I do NOT RESIDE in the CORPORATION OF ESSEX, nor am I a PERSON within the definition of the \"codes\" or \"by-laws\" you have cited. Therefore I am unclear, and do NOT understand how I or the man known as xxx xx, have ANY obligation to the CORPORATION OF ESSEX and/or to it's agents/officers, as we are unaware of any SIGNED contracts that have explicitly waived any rights. Is there a record that suggest we did?\n\n  Please provide the EVIDENCE you are relying on that I, or the MAN known as xxx xx, have harmed, damaged or infringed on another human beings rights or property, as we are of the understanding that none exist, please provide the verified sworn/affirmed complaint, as I have not had an opportunity to hear or see a verified complaint. Who am I harming exactly?\n\n What EVIDENCE do YOU have that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a TRUSTEE and/or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN, and/or THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX? What EVIDENCE do you have of any WARRANT OF AGENCY for the PRINCIPAL? What EVIDENCE do you have that there has been any MEETING OF THE MINDS, any PROPER NOTICE GIVEN, any CONSIDERATION OFFERED, or that I have ANY  INTENT TO CONTRACT with the CORPORATION OF ESSEX in this matter? As such, I am returning your offer, DECLINED, for IMMEDIATE discharge and closure. \n\n  NOTICE OF WAIVER OF PUBLIC BENEFITS (ONTARIO CHANGE OF NAME ACT [R.S.O 1990, CHAPTER C.7]\nWHEREAS YOU, being a PUBLIC SERVANT and/or an OFFICER for a PUBLIC TRUST, and/or A GOVERNMENTAL AGENT/OFFICIAL, do NOT have the right, and/or AUTHORITY, to attach SURETY and/or JOINDER, to ANY NAME DERIVED FROM A PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and attach such NAME and/or JOINDER to ME , and\n\nWHEREAS YOU, being a PUBLIC SERVANT and/or an OFFICER for a PUBLIC TRUST, and/or A GOVERNMENTAL AGENT/OFFICIAL, are BOUND BY OATH, I THEREFORE, ACCEPT YOUR OATH OF OFFICE, and respectfully GIVE NOTICE that I, in fact waive ALL benefits of the ONTARIO CHANGE OF NAME ACT [R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER C.7], and as such I MUST DECLINE any such benefits.\n\nIf I, and/or such other parties who act in my interest, have caused YOU to believe that my PRIVATE NAME is derived from ANY PUBLIC DOCUMENT, then that would be a MISTAKE, and please forgive me.\n\nTAKE NOTICE THAT, Should THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX continue with attacks on my rights, thus harming me unlawfully, the following shall apply\n\n1 (a) FEE SCHEDULE: \nAll \"ORDERS\", issued by, or brought forth by, the CORPORATION OF ESSEX, to ME, WILL BE BILLED ACCORDINGLY. I do NOT work for free (involuntary servitude), and it is UNLAWFUL to COMPEL me to. I can, however prepare a bill, should THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX insist on placing an ORDER, with reference to the bills of exchange act, regarding orders.\n\n(b) TRESPASSING: $25,000 per occurrence \n\n  xxx xxxx was told verbally, via the phone conversation, and presuming xxx xxxx can in fact read, could not miss the posted signs on the PRIVATE PROPERTY, That read as follows: PRIVATE PROPERTY/NO TRESPASSING. xxx xxxx elected to willfully ignore my verbal warnings, and also chose to ignore the postings, and I must presume, deliberately waited for me to be away from my home to commit the trespass...twice, according to the dates on record. Had xxx xxxx been in anyway honourable, I would think he would have made it known, WHEN exactly, he would be arriving, so as to provide the answers to my questions and thus, avoid any confusion, and/or conflict, clearly xxx xxxx has mistaken me, a man, for a \"person\" defined in the fictitious by-law/codes.\n\n  As I had taken the time to take a look through a bit of both the by-law, and the building code act cited, and was unclear how either applied to a real live man, and further, looked to the definition section for clarification, and still found no evidence to that effect, I am not surprised that xxx xxxx opted to disregard my wishes, to first provide some first hand knowledge, and/or facts, that I should be compelled to do anything, as I requested from the start. Rather, xxx xxxx thought that his \"badge\" exempted him from any sort of due process liability, and said as much to me on the phone, his actions of trespass, without first providing me with said evidence, is clear verification that, he either truly has no clue, HOW the by-law/code applies to me, without my CONSENT, Maybe he has never bothered to actually read, and understand the definition section of the by-law/codes he enforces, and thinks that his imaginary authority over a man, and his \" badge\", really does offer xxx xxxx immunity from being personally liable for his actions, and trespasses! Or he would have provided the binding contract, or evidence, that I had asked for from the start, that would compel me to go along with his \"order\".\n \nWhatever the reason, in the spirit of being honourable I will allow xxx xxxx, and/or ANYONE from THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, that can provide a better answer than \"because I have a badge\" (the local police force doesn't even spew that kind of nonsense!), 14 days from receipt of this NOTICE, to rebut everything I have claim to, noticed, and understand, under penalty of perjury, and full commercial liability.\n\nOr you can kindly send me an apology letter, and I in turn will forgive xxx xxxx for his trespasses on my right to privacy, property, security, full disclosure, and also the stress that comes with answering this sort of attack.\n\nCLAIM OF RIGHT: TAKE NOTICE THAT, ALL PROPERTY at the location known as 9577 Walker Road, Mcgregor is held under A COMMON LAW CLAIM OF RIGHT.\n\nFrom the Criminal Code:\n 39. Defence with claim of right\n39. (1) Every one who is in peaceable possession of personal property under a claim of right, and every one acting under his authority, is protected from criminal responsibility for defending that possession, even against a person entitled by law to possession of it, if he uses no more force than is necessary.\n\nSo, to conclude,once again: \n\n 1) Provide the dually signed contract and/or current employment records, that show I, and/or the man known as xx xxx has an obligation to the CORPORATION OF ESSEX, and,\n\n2)Provide the EVIDENCE you are relying on that I, or the MAN known as xxx xx, have harmed, damaged or infringed on another human beings rights or property, as we are of the understanding that none exist, please provide the verified sworn/affirmed complaint, as I have not had an opportunity to hear or see a verified complaint. Who am I harming exactly, and how?\n\n3)Provide proof, and/or first hand knowledge that I, and/or the man known as xxx xx have been given full disclosure to the terms of our alleged relationship with, THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, and had thus given consent to be governed by, THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, or,\n\n4)Send an apology letter, and/or never contact me again\n\nAgain, the office/agents of the PROPERTY STANDARDS COMMITTEE, THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, AND/OR xxx xxxx,  have 14 days to respond, and/or rebut in writing, with FACTS, to the above notice, claims, and understanding, under penalty of perjury, and full commercial liability.\n\n All rights reserved for Kelleran Holman\n\nwitnessed by:\n\nwitnessed by:\n~end\nshorter and hopefully \"race ready\".... for your consideration group, thanks again!",
