   "message": "I have sent in affidavits stating that we don't consent and those were ingnored, and I even bruoght it up in court asking why they are not acknowledging the fact that we are not consenting to the order, Judge told me that, Oh we understand that you are not consenting that is why we are having a hearing, because you requested it. Judge is the one that decided to have hearing, he stated that because we were not agreeing to anything, that we were looking to get the kids back home and the Agency out of our lives, I said yes. So apparently that is what started the hearing, which now isn't going to happen.",
