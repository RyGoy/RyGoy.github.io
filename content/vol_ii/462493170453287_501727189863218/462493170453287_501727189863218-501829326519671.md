   "message": "You know what, I have only learned about this movement last Aug. and I can only go by where other people point me and what makes sense to me. Everything else that we have done has gotten us nowhere only more time apart from my kids. It was suggested to do a notice of mistake and then a petition, and that is what I'm doing. I am determined to try things that make sense, and i DON'T care if that may cause me to go to jail or whatever. Being without our kids, kinda makes you that way. I was already threatened with contempt of court. I could care less. The judge said a year ago that he felt there were issues with the integrity of the investigation and that one of the charges that they accused us of had no basis. But here we are still in the mess of things. Even though the judge states this in court according to the CPS lawyer - This is argument and not relevant to whether the children remain in need of protective services and is otherwise contrary to family court rule.",
