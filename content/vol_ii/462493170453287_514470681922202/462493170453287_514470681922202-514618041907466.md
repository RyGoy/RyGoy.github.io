I have Pierre, for that. :P\n\nStart erasing the bullshit. You will find lots to facilitate that activity here. :D\n\nYou aren't here claiming to know more than me, so I have the patience of Job. Those that dare claim they have ANY \"secrets\" to tell, are purged in the most demeaning way i can thinkof at the time. Big entertainment.\n\nThere are those who will say this is the ONLY useful thing on Facebook. Some even created accounts, JUST SO THEY COULD READ THIS GROUP :D\n\n...read. You have much to learn. I try to keep it simple... but it hurts.",
