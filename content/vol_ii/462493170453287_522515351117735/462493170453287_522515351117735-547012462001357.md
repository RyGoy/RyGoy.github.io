   "message": "Jason, I have a warrant out for my arrest for an expired drivers license.  I was forced under duress to sign a citation, two days after I signed I certified mailed and had delivered an affidavit of non corporate status and  rescind my signature on the citation/contract but a warrant was issued anyways.  3 deputies came to my home to arrest me, damaged my door and scared the hell out of everyone in my home.  I didn't admit to being the \"PERSON\"  and after several hours the deputies finally left.  They've parked outside of my home for months and spoken to several of my neighbors asking them to call them when I leave my home so they can arrest me.",
