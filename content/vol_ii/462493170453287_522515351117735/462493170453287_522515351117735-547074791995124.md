   "message": "Kirsten, the BC (Legal Person) that says KIRSTEN CARLSTROM on it IS Surety for the debt.  It is also a registered voter!  It is a costume.  If you put it on, you are subject to the rules.  If you don't wear it, (or place a lien on it and wear it (as you are the only one who has given it value)), there is no jurisdiction!  So yes,  If you wear the costume and accept the SURETY, your labor is security for the debt.",
