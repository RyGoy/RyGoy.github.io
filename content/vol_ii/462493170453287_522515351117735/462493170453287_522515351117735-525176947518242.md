   "message": "The BC is the receit for your security, which is the registration of a live birth. The gov is the trustee of that doc. The BC is not only a receit of the security but an assigned name that allows the human to function as a corporation in this commercial system. You only have the right of use for the name! It was \"given\" to you! The fraud is to shift liability from the legal title owner to the beneficiary and equitable title owner of the name. Know who you Are!",
