A Jewish contract (esp. for release of an\nobligation) that Richard I declared to be invalid unless\nit was placed in a lawful repository, the largest being in\nthe king's Exchequer at Westminster. Also termed\nstarra.\n\"It is well known that, before the banishment of the Jews\nunder Edward I, their contracts and obligations were\ndenominated in our ancient records starra or starrs, from\na corruption of the Hebrew word, sheeay, a covenant ....\nThese starrs, by an ordinance of Richard the first ... were\ncommanded to be enrolled and deposited in chests under\nthree keys in certain places; one, and the most considerable,\nof which was in the king's exchequer at Westminster\n.... [T]he room at the exchequer, where the chests\ncontaining these starrs were kept, was probably called the\nstarr-chamber, and, when the Jews were expelled from the\nkingdom, was applied to the use of the king's council, when\nsitting in their judicial capacity.\" 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries\non the Laws of England 263 n.a (1769)",
