   "message": "So I have just returned from court again!! Today was to set a trial date, for the charges against the crown and the cop.  I used the notice of mistake as I had last week on the same justice.  He said he wouldn't discuss it again!  I said he was incompetent and he didn't mind and asked him to recuse himself, he said no!!  These mother fuckers are pissing me off!!  I have a trial in JUne 17/18 and another Oct 28/29.  I am soooo pissed right now!! Who do these fuckers think they are?  The next step I will do is lien the charges!! VERY FRUSTRATING!!",
