   "message": "Oh yea, they charged me with harassment and inciting fear, because I mentioned where a judge lived, didn't sent it to a judge, but the cop and crown now think I am stalking them and are afraid.  I am 50 yrs old and have a fucking curfew!!  But, I am ususally in bed by 9 anyway!!  They are totally afraid of me, lawsuits and liens!!",
