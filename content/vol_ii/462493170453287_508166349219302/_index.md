   "message": "WHICH CROWN DOES THIS � ULTIMATE HEIR ACT � TRULY MAKING REFERENCE TOO ???? THIS TOP PART IS INFORMATION ON THE TWO CROWNS,hope link works ....\n\nTHE TEMPLARS OF THE CROWN\n\nThe governmental and judicial systems within the United States of America, at both federal and local state levels, is owned by the \"CROWN,\" which is a private foreign power. Before jumping to conclusions about the QUEEN OF ENGLAND OR THE ROYAL FAMILIES OF BRITAIN owning the U.S.A., this is a different \"Crown\" and is fully exposed and explained below. We are specifically referencing the established TEMPLAR CHURCH, KNOWN FOR CENTURIES BY THE WORLD AS THE \"CROWN.\" From this point on, we will also refer to the Crown as the Crown Temple or Crown Templar, all three being synonymous.\n\nFirst, a little historical background. The Temple Church was built by the Knights Templar in two parts: the Round and the Chancel. The Round Church was consecrated in 1185 and modeled after the circular Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The Chancel was built in 1240. The Temple Church serves both the Inner and Middle Temples (see below) and is located between Fleet Street and Victoria Embankment at the Thames River. Its grounds also house the Crown Offices at Crown Office Row. This Temple \"Church\" is outside any canonical jurisdiction. The Master of the Temple is appointed and takes his place by sealed (non-public) patent, without induction or institution.\n\nAll licensed Bar Attorneys - Attorners (see definitions below) - in the U.S. owe their allegiance and give their solemn oath in pledge to the Crown Temple, realizing this or not. This is simply due to the fact that all Bar Associations throughout the world are signatories and franchises to the international Bar Association located at the Inns of Court at Crown Temple, which are physically located at Chancery Lane behind Fleet Street in London. Although they vehemently deny it, all Bar Associations in the U.S., such as the American Bar Association, the Florida Bar, or California Bar Association, are franchises to the Crown.\n\nhttp://nesara.insights2.org/CrownTemplars.html\n\nULTIMATE HEIR ACT\n\nChapter U-1\n\nHER MAJESTY, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, enacts as follows:\n\nDefinition\n\n1   In this Act, �ultimate heir� means the person entitled to take by descent or distribution the property of whatsoever nature of an intestate in the event of failure of heirs or next of kin entitled to take that property by the law in force before July 1, 1929.\n\nRSA 1980 cU-1 s1\n\nThe ultimate heir\n\n2   The Crown in right of Alberta is the ultimate heir\n\na)    of any person dying intestate in fact with regard to any property situated in Alberta, and\n\nb)    of any person domiciled in Alberta and dying intestate with regard to any movable property or chose in action wherever situated.\n\nRSA 1980 cU-1 s2\n\n�Heir�, etc. to include Crown\n\n3   The words �heir�, �heirs�, or �next of kin� in any document transferring land situated in Alberta, or giving or evidencing title  to land, are to be construed by all courts and judges in Alberta as including the Crown in right of Alberta, but only after all other heirs or next of kin.\n\nhttp://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/stat/rsa-2000-c-u-1/latest/rsa-2000-c-u-1.html",
