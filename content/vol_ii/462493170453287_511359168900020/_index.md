   "message": "Scott on how to deal with a BILL-COLLECTOR, and how to SIGN/or NOT sign the RESPONSE with NOTICE-thread.....\n\nScott Duncan: 1: Demand PROOF that you owe. A BILL or a SIGNED INVOICE will do. They never produce one\n\n2: SET THE TERMS THROUGH NOTICE (Do not sign it! A notice of NO PARKING or KEEP OFF THE GRASS is not signed; neither should yours be)\n\nReturn ALL paper to them REGISTERED MAIL, along with NOTICE.\n\nMake notices STANDALONE. They don't include other things with \"No parking\" and \"keep off the grass\", so you shouldn't either.\n\nSend a bill back with the next thing they send you (and you return)\n\nEamonn O Brien: Scott Duncan why shouldn't we sign a reply to their notices?\n\nScott Duncan: Signing attaches a NAME to the RESPONSE. Surety is assumed.\n\nNo Name\nNo signature\nNo Surety\n\nYou want to send a \"keep off the grass\" notice, not write a love letter and/or become pen pals.\n\nEamonn O Brien: I signed my name after stating my capacity in relation tot he name...\n\nSigned_____________________(Authorised rep./Administratot/beneficiary)\n\nAnything but surety/trustee\n\nThat any good?\n\nScott Duncan:  NO BRACKETS! You exclude the contained from the document.\n\nBY:________________NON ASSUMPSIT, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED",
