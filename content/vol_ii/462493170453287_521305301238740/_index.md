   "message": "So a few years ago I was arrested and Charged with theft of a gas utility and mischief causing damage.  At the first hearing I was ordered to go for a psychological evaluation.  ( which I never did)  the second hearing i presented this document.  ALL CHARGES and conditions were dropped.  Now I know you will rip apart as you say the imaginary person in the sky part ( so lets not waste time with that.)  Why did this work?  \n\nEcclesiastical Notice of Asservation\n\nFrom: michael ryan of the jean-louis family                                          2011/07/20\ncalgary, Alberta, Canada, geographical  location\nno code, non commercial\n\nTo Judges Qaarters\n601 5 Street SWt6\nCALGARY , AB\nT2P 5P7\n\n NOTICE\nThis is a Private Ecclesiastical, Non Commercial Assumptive contract/agreement/covenant and understanding between michael ryan of the jean-louis family and the judges quarters the private man.\nProvided under protest and duress\n\nHello Judges Quarters, I am michael ryan of the family jean-louis, you will address me as minister daslow.  I come here as a duty to God not to the courts to minister the office of the estate with the name RYAN JEAN-LOUIS.  I am not the legal fiction you are seeking to contract with.  \"I am here because I have obeyed God rather than man. Your duty is to punish evil doers as God has defined evil. What evil have I done?� (Acts 5:29)\n\nDeclaration of private ministry under God and his Perpetual law.\nI am declaring that I am God created; My Christian given name is Michael ryan Arthur jerry of the jean-louis family and; I am a private ecclesiastical man man under God as my creator and no man or woman has a moral or lawful right to impose anything upon me without my informed consent and; That I do hereby renounce any fraudulent, corporate, assumptive contract and do honor the directive and obligation to respect the equal god given freedoms of other men and women under His law.  To all those who set eyes on this Ecclesiastical Determination,  I do hereby, officially performing the functions of my calling serve notice to all private men and women who receive this that any offer made herein, prior to, or on my part imply acceptance of intimidation, violence, or threats of violence against me and that no such offer implies that  I will submit to any intimidation in the future.  I as a bondservant of Christ, do henceforth offer the good faith of proclamation of my freeborn will to live in peace and declare that, by right of God, the de facto authorities edicts, codes, obligations, statutes, taxes, licenses, and prohibitions are not binding upon me, or applicable upon God�s ministers and his children \n\n  I am who my Father says I am, not who Caesar says I am. \nI love my God, I love my neighbor, I even love each and every one of you.\n\n�Capitis Diminutio ( meaning the diminishing of status through the use of capitalization)  In Roman law.  A diminishing or abridgement of personality, a loss or curtailment of a man�s status or aggregate of legal attribute and qualifications.�  Black�s Law Dictionary 4th Edition.  1968\n\nI am a man, a flesh and blood living being, not an �ARTIFICIAL PERSON�  (A legal entity not a human being, recognized as a person in law to whom legal rights and duties may attach)\n\nTo create joinder between the man and the PERSON will be considered fraud and is punishable under the Criminal Code of CANADA.\n\nI do not grant the court jurisdiction over the man Michael Ryan Arthur Jerry of the house of Jean-Louis nor will I allow the court to fraudulently create joinder between the man and the PERSON. From this point forward and forever it is my will that the only way to create joinder between me and any legal PERSON is in writing and witnessed by a Notary Public provided with my consent.\n\nthat  �inasmuch as every government is an artificial person, an abstraction, and creature of the mind only , a government can interface only with artificial persons.  The imaginary, having neither actuality nor substance, is foreclosed from creating and attaining parity with the tangible.  The legal manifestation of this is that no government, as well as any law, agency, aspect, court, etc. can concern itself with anything other than corporate, artificial persons and the contracts between them.�\nPenhallow v Doane�s administrators, 3 U.S. 54 (1795) at p\n\nPope Pius XI wrote Divini redemptoris: \"The human being ought to be put in the first rank of earthly realities.\" Pope Pius XII wrote July 14, 1946: \"It is the human being that Yahweh put at the top of the visible universe, making him, in economics and politics as well, the measure of all things.\"\nIt is not Government who is at the top; it is the human being. The human being therefore does not belong to Government; it is rather Government that must belong to the human being, who must serve him by exercising its function of guardian of human freedoms.\nMaurice Allard, the MP for Sherbrooke, Que., also said during this debate on the Bill of Rights: \"The individual must not become a tool or a victim of the State; it is the State which, while making laws, must favour the numerous freedoms of man.\"\nis it the duty of Men, and therefore it our heartfelt desire, to ensure that all men recall their Maxim: �No man shall be ignorant of God�, lest we offend God by stating or acting as if any rule of man�s law is precedental or supercedent to His supreme Law.\n\n\"Is it not written in your law that the law does not compel a man to do the impossible (maxim), and, also, any law contrary to the law of God is no law at all (maxim)? I was exercising my duty of movement upon the common ways. My warrant for doing that is written in the Word of God, \"Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature\" (Mark 16:15), also, \"To visit orphans and widows\" (James 1:27). And it is also written, \"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me\" (Philippians 4:13).\n,\n \"Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law\" \n\"It is also written in your law that an act does not make a man guilty unless the intention be guilty. Since my intention is to do God's Will, and God's Will is not evil, I could not possibly be guilty in this thing I am accused of.\"\n\"I cannot accept any benefits offered by the court. And as a bondman of Christ Jesus, I cannot represent \"myself,\" for that denotes self-will. I don't have any self-will. Jesus the Christ is my Advocate and Wonderful Counselor\" (1 John 2:1, Isaiah 9:6).\nIt is written in your law that \"No man is ignorant of God�s Law\" (Maxim). The Scripture saith, \"There is one lawgiver (James 4:12). The Lord is our lawgiver (Isaiah 33:22).\" It is also written in your law, \"We are all bound to our lawgiver, regardless of our personal interpretation of reality (Maxim). Legality is not reality\" (Maxim). The reality is what God says it is, not what your perception of it is. It is also written in your law, \"There is no fiction without law. Fictions arise from the law, and not law from fictions\" (Maxim).\n\nto remove any items from my possession will be immediately considered theft and is punishable under the Criminal Code of CANADA \n\nI am protected from criminal responsibility for defending my possessions even against a person entitled by law to possession of it.  Criminal Code of CANADA pt. 1 section 39. (1)  \n\nATCO first broke the law acoording to article 51 Notwithstanding the terms of any contract, a person or\ncompany furnishing or supplying gas by retail or wholesale either directly or indirectly to or for the public or any member of the public shall not discontinue the furnishing or supplying of the gas by reason of or pursuant to any other contractual obligations in respect of the furnishing or supplying of gas.\nRSA 1980 cG-4 s42\n\nArticle 52 of the gas utlities act of Alberta states 52(1) A person who fails to comply with this Act or the regulations is guilty of an offence.\n(2) A person who advises, solicits, persuades, instructs, directs or orders a person\n(a) to do an act or thing prohibited by this Act or the regulations, or\n(b) to omit to do an act or thing required to be done by this Act or the regulations\nis guilty of an offence.\n(3) A person who is guilty of an offence under this section is liable to a fine not exceeding $3,000,000 for each day or part of a day on which the offence occurs or continues.\n\n422. (1) Every one who wilfully breaks a contract, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the probable consequences of doing so, whether alone or in combination with others, will be\n(a) to endanger human life,\n(b) to cause serious bodily injury,\n(c) to expose valuable property, real or personal, to destruction or serious injury,\n(d) to deprive the inhabitants of a city or place, or part thereof, wholly or to a great extent, of their supply of light, power, gas or water, or\n(e) to delay or prevent the running of any locomotive engine, tender, freight or passenger train or car, on a railway that is a common carrier,\nis guilty of\n(f) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or\n(g) an offence punishable on summary conviction.\n\nNo police officer would respond to these complaints when brought forward to them including CST J.H HAMEL\n   We wish for the case to be dismissed or to be given a void judgment based on \n\nCharges were laid based on assumption the arresting officer CST. J.H HAMEL nor any other officer or an employee of ATCO GAS never entered the residence to verify the appliances were turned on and consuming gas.\n\nThere is no injured party to come forward .\n It is written in your law that corporations, such as ATCO GAS have no souls�they are dead, and the dead cannot be sued, and the dead cannot receive an injury. Can you show me any law that says the living must be joined to the dead? God's Law says that we are not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers (2 Corinthians 6:14), and it is also written in your law that �unequal things ought not to be joined� (maxim). Therefore, it is God's Will that I not be joined to the dead, for scripture says, \"God is not the God of the dead, but of the living (Matthew 22:32) .\"\n\nAll witness statements are hearsay \n\nIt is stated that the ACCUSED tampered with the meter, How is this possible if the meter was removed by ATCO GAS when DAVID SINCLAIR attested that the meter was removed 2010/06/29\n\nThe Chief Financial Officer JAMES SPENCE of DIRECT ENERGY and myself had a tacit agreement. That if he did not accept my payment I had sent in and if my meter was not returned within 10 days upon receiving the letter by registered mail.  Or if I did not receive a response from him in writing I would reconnect the line myself.  He did not respond or return my meter I remained in honor by following through with our agreement",
