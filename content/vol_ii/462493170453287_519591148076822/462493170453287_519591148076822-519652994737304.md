   "message": "Why do people believe I'm one of that fucking free-dumb crowd?\n\nMY rights are the only thing I care about. You are all too stupid to KNOW what to do with rights.\n\nI'm not all about eating vegies and twigs. I don't think \"peace and love\" IS ANYTHING BUT SELF-INFLICTED DELUSION, and above all...\n\n...I don't care if they round you all up and put you into FEMA camps.\n\nYou are all responsible for this! Your imaginary friends, your parents, your idiotic love and respect for \"belief\", your collective celebration of ignorance, and all of you are responsible for this happening.",
