   "message": "We need help fighting evil & getting the word out on this! We also need a good lawyers help! Does anyone know one? Iï¿½m not allowed to speak or show evidence in their courts. I have tons of evidence of many illegal & unconstitutional acts done by Troopers, DAs & Judges! They are after the 4th right now as in my case, but I can stop them if I can get this petition signed so evidence can be brought to light. It's about your right to defend yourself in your own home! Make this Petition to the Governor go viral & sign PLEASE! ",
