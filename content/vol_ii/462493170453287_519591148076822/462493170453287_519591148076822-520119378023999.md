But I've been told that it would be to my advantage to try and befriend them. If you did that, who knows, they may just turn out to be your best friend. I looked at my dog and thought, you are my best friend. So I set out to befriend a Lawyer. After numerous attempts to catch the attention of a Lawyer one finally said to me, \"What is your problem? You are patting your leg and saying come on boy. Do you think that I'm some kind of dog or something? Do I look like a dog? Do I sound like a dog as I'm speaking?\" I looked at him for a moment and then threw a gallon pail of gas on him. \"You goddam bastard, I'm going to sue your fucking ass off\" Well that did not sound like a dog, so I lit a match and tossed it in his direction and to my surprise, \"WOOF\".  OK, I know that was bad, but I needed some fun thoughts to brighten up this rainy day. Please forgive me Scott.",
