If you are looking for a lawyer to torture and kill, then that's fine.\n\nIf you are looking for a lawyer to douse with gasoline and set on fire, that will be fine too.\n\nIf you are looking for a lawyer to save your little buddy. YOU'RE FUCKED, and a lawyer gets his pockets lined with cash from your ignorance/stupidity.",
