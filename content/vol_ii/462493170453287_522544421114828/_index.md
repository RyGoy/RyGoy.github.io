   "message": "Tom here,  recently have been informed, or perhaps misinformed that the function of the governor general is to represent the creditors of Canada to the government of Canada.  If this is so,  would instructing the governor general to present the notice of mistake to the Government on our behalf not be an effective way of making the office of governor general a liable party for making sure that the notice is understood and enforced?\nAlso, Cara is sick of me using her facebook, how close are you to having your website up, what is its link? saw it earlier but cant find it again.",
