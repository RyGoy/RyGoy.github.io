   "message": "This was posted a while back and Scott didn't seem to think it was a good idea then. Maybe it was because of an ongoing spat between Tony Boutros, Dean and Scott. The post at the time was from Tony's Blogtalk show. I am pretty sure at one time it was said in here that there was some issue with being a plaintiff in court. Anyways if I have made a mistake about any of this please forgive me.",
