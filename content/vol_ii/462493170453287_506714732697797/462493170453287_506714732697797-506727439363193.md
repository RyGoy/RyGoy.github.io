GodsGrace Pearson, unless you form the INTENT and MAKE FIRST CONTACT, then THEY are the ones initiating the contact.\n\nYour imaginary friend doesn't seem to be able to help you with the fucking obvious, and the fact that adults with imaginary friends is considered \"normal\" is EXACTLY WHY THE OBVIOUS IS A MYSTERY TO YOU!\n\n\"Godsgrace\"? Are you kidding me? You need to dump your imaginary friend and focus on reality. Your \"beliefs\" are why you can't THINK. You will notice I give your ilk all the ridicule and contempt I can throw at them; Adults with imaginary friends are the result of the Noble Lie, and EVERY time you speak of \"god's Grace\" you support the very lies you are fighting. YOUR KIND HARM OTHERS.\n\nYOUR BELIEFS are why CHILDREN get stolen. YOU HARM SOCIETY:\n\nTake it away, Dusty!\n\nhttp://youtu.be/IlXkjrluq_4",
