   "message": "And that is why you are stupid.\nThat is why you can't think.\n\nSpongebob is always misinterpreted too...and guess what, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY. Make all the excuses you want! You will never be able to think as long as your brain is dedicated to keeping imaginary things REAL.\n\nThere is NO \"god\" playing a role in ANY of this. You don't NEED to confirm the obvious, and only BELIEF makes you doubt reality. ALL BELIEF IS EVIL. Belief in imaginary sky-daddies IS EVIL, and as long as you think there is a \"god\" playing a hand in your existence, YOU ARE EVIL. Your silly excuses notwithstanding.",
