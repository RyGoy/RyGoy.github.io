   "message": "Your statement would be untrue, and made up by yourself, and only serves as malice.\n\nDelusions about \"god\" are very real, and declared by the recipient of my righteous hatred of such delusions. Make up diseases for me, and declare them true, is not the same as an adult with an imaginary friend being upset when I point out the harm their delusions cause.\n\nThe banks and the courts are what the byproduts your delusions have produced. It was done ON PURPOSE, and WITH INTENT, and I will NEVER 'respect\" a belief in ANY delusion that supports the Noble Lie.\n\nHave all the delusions you like, but your imaginary friends aren't welcome here, and if you really think your \"morality\" is based on these delusions, then you are a sleeping drone serving a bank. Talk about \"controlled opposition\". \n\nYour imaginary \"syphilis\" diagnosis is not the same as my ACTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE HARM YOUR KIND CAUSES. EVERY man, woman, or child who thinks there is a \"god\" is ENABLING the noble lie, and you deserve no more \"respect\" than a mafia wife.\n\nWhat I say does not stop being true because it hurts your feelings.",
