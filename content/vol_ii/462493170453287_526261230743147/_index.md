   "message": "HISTORY OF THE CROWN & ABORIGINAL TITLE\n\nAboriginal peoples across what is now known as North America have maintained a strong connection to the land since time immemorial. Although there is vast cultural variation between First Nations, most groups maintained similar beliefs and principles that governed their relationship with and responsibility to the land.\n\nMost First Nations did not believe that pieces of land could or should be owned by individuals�humans, along with all other living beings, belonged to the land. The land provided for humans, and in turn, humans bore a responsibility to respect and care for it. Many Aboriginal peoples understand this as a reciprocal relationship with the land.\n\nEUROPEAN SETTLERS ARRIVING IN NORTH AMERICA BROUGHT WITH THEM CONCEPTS OF PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERSHIP, AND THE NOTION THAT HUMANS COULD, AND SHOULD, OWN LAND AS A STEP TOWARDS �CIVILIZATION.� \n\nIn 1763 the British Crown issued The Royal Proclamation, a document that recognized Aboriginal title during European settlement of what is now Canada. The Proclamation states that ownership over North America is issued to King George III, but that ABORIGINAL TITLE EXISTS AND CAN ONLY BE EXTINGUISHED BY TREATY WITH THE CROWN.\n\nThe Proclamation further specifies that Aboriginal land can only be sold or ceded to the Crown, and not directly to settlers. \n\n",
