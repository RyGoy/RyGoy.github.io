   "message": "Sure!...when there is a mistake!\n\nSadly your parents REGISTERED the children. You can't UN-Register them.\n\nHOW would you apply it? CUSTODY is a legal term. If you DON'T want custody, notice of mistake is good for that. ALL \"Legal responsibility\" for the child would be removed...\n\n...I can't think of any other way to apply it.",
