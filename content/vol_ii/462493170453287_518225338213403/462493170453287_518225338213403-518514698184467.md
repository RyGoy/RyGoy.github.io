   "message": "Actually, Jesus was about ACTION. For instance he said, ï¿½But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one.\" in Luke 22:36 In John 2:15 \"So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.\" Jesus was about kicking their asses AND he was targeting the right group. THAT is why he's dead. (btw, I'm not religious, but I know what the book says)",
