   "message": "National Kick-a-cop-in-the-face Day is my proposed Private Member's bill I intend to submit, if I am ever forced into public office (Legally I could be, because of my title).\n\nI have NO intention of breaking the law. National Kick-a-cop-in-the-face Day will be perfectly legal, before I indulge, in this socially-benefiting activity the whole family can enjoy.\n\nAs National Kick-a-cop-in-the-face Day is currently NOT legal, I cannot actively endorse it.\n\n...but if you find yourself in a position where you need to kick a cop in the face, remember it's illegal, but you'd really be helping the world out :D",
