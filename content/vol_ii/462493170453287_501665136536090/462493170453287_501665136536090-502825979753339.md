   "message": "Adam Thomas, I think you just read things and don't connect them.\n\nFirst: Banks/government/Lou Manotti DIDN'T MAKE BITCOIN! Computer Scientists like ME made it. There's no \"big conspiracy\". It is an experiment to see if a competing/BETTER currency could be made.\n\nARE ALL OF YOU AS STUPID AS ADAM? DOES ANYONE ELSE THINK BITCOIN IS A \"NEW WORLD ORDER\" CONSPIRACY?\n\nSeriously. It hurts to dumb myself down to your level as it is. Am I to understand my efforts are wasted, or is Adam the exception?\n\nPLEASE let me know. I don't have time to waste on idiocy and ignorance anymore, and If Adam's view is yours, PLEASE, I BEG YOU ALL, TELL ME NOW so I waste not another precious moment of life on you stupid sheep.",
