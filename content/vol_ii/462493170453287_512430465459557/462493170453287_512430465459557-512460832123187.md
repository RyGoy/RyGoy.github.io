   "message": "Only STATE EMPLOYEES of the Foreign Corporation are required to tag their vehicles, but you did so, just in case you ever decided to go to work for the STATE, and the fact they threaten to impound it if you don't.\n\nSo, because it has a tag, they are under the 'presumption' you are one of their employees, which is just fine and dandy if that's the stance they wish to take.\n\nBut, you see in life, there are consequences to making baseless presumptions, and one of those consequences is this:\n\nSince the STATE presumes you work for them, then it's safe for you to presume you're getting paid; to presume they've just been holding your bi-monthly checks because they've conveniently forgot to mail them on the 1st and 15th of every month since the day you first tagged THEIR vehicle ;)\n\nCan they rebut your presumption? Do you really want to rebut theirs?\n\nTo rebut their presumption could cost you thousands of dollars they owe you for driving THEIR state owned vehicle all these years.\n\nI love the fact they presume I'm an employee, and as soon as they decide to exercise their authority over me, I'll be showing up to collect my money.\n\nIf they don't want to pay me my money, I'll start a website especially for them, that will inform ALL Citizens of the state, that the state indeed owes them some back pay ;)\n\nLets play ball !",
