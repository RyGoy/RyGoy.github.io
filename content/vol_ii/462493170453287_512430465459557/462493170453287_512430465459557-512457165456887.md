   "message": "Send them a \"Fuck You\" letter :) If they DEMAND you pay, be sure to show up with the payment receipts for your vehicle; the insurance; the fuel; the wiper blades, the tires, that new engine you had to put in it last year, and a fee schedule for the amount of money they owe you in back pay.\n\nNote: That vehicle belongs to THEM, it is THEIR responsibility to tag it and make sure the stickers are up to date, not yours ... unless of course, you are being paid for you time to drive that state owned vehicle, in which they will have payroll receipts and an employment contract on file for you.\n\nWhen you registered the vehicle with the state, you basically handed it over to them. They sent you back a title, which basically passes the obligation over to you while they maintain ownership ;)\n\nSo that's fine; they own it, and along with owning a vehicle comes maintenance of that vehicle, including the purchase price, which they have yet to reimburse you for ;) and your back pay ;)\n\nDo you REALLY think the STATE would allow ANYONE other than a STATE EMPLOYEE to drive around town in one of THEIR vehicles? \n\nSince they are under the presumption you are one of their employees, you may also operate under the presumption you are getting paid for you time, and you are to be reimbursed for every penny you've put into that vehicle since the day they gave it to you to drive :)",
