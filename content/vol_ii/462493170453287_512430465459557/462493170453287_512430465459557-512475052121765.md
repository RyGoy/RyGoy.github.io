   "message": "you may be trying to tell them you aren't an employee, and thus exempt, BUT you siugned up and \"applied\" for a drivers license, meaning that in fact you actually ARE a government employee, thus being double minded. Go back and undo the original contract for lack of disclosure to you , and you would never have signed up if all the facts were made known to you, it was a Mistake from the get go.",
