   "message": "How many of you guys disrespect women?  I've already seen Scott solicit for 'cum bunnies'....which is certainly not disrespectful, but a generous offer to employ for service....well....who knows how generous....and I would be very suspect of the wording of any contract he writes.....but I digress...how many guys ask a girl they meet for her phone number?  Most guys do....\"I GOT her number\"....Then it's \"I GOT to kiss her\" \"I GOT to feel her up.\"  Etc.  This is just how the cops talk (and snicker) back at the station after they GOT you to identify yourselves, submit to questions, searches, etc, etc.  And we have the nerve to be offended?  No.  You offer your own phone number and totally leave it up to her to contact you.  If it's time for kissy feely fucky, you announce your request like an honourable gentleman and thank her for any refusal or conditional acceptance.  We're talking chivalry here and if Scott were to contract with me for lessons he wouldn't have to advertise.  We might be able to have a barter relationship (for legal goods)....but I don't do hookers, or pot...or bits-o-coins.  This advice above is payment for one time use of your lovely \"Notice of Mistake\".",
