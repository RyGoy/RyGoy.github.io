   "message": "It's my understanding now that since any 'ticket' is an offer to contract, and actually an assumption of an adhesion contract through the registered vehicle....one would do best to write 'no contract' diagonally across the 'ticket' and return it to the issuing cop store/ franchise office.  Of course they, being robots working for other robots will process this as they normally do anyway.  So you will have to make your stand in the ordinary ways we are doing here anyway.  You might as well take the plates off, collect yellow bits of paper until they either shoot you or beg you to share your enlightened buddhist 'non-attachment' spiritual system...and then start a commune like Osho did....oh...they jailed him for income tax violations too didn't they?",
