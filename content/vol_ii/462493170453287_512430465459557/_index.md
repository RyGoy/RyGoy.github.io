   "message": "I received a ticket for not having a sticker up to date on my plate, I sent the ticket in marked not guilty, with a note asking them to prove I worked for them , show pay stubs. registered letter, I only received the notice to appear in court. I found that the name on the ticket was not mine, so I sent it back., with a second letter asking again for records to show I work  for them,  but they sent back the ticket with the proper capitalized name,  so I sent them a third letter asking them to reply to my request for pay stubs, they gave me a date in aug to go to court, (which is in a city 3 hours away) I replied all letters, \"without prejudice\" but am wondering, sending them three letters, do I have a right to my answer from them? should I have stated after my name, \"grantor\" ? if you have any answers to what might be the next step it would be greatly appreciated. thanks Bruce",
