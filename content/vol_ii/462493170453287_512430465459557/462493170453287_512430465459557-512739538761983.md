   "message": "Love is indeed a contract.  You offer everything and hold nothing back.  If you think to benefit then you are not a lover able to contract....you can't afford love.  A real lover is nothing and the beloved is everything.   Most can never come into love in full liability and utter honour.  They hedge and blame, place conditions, and want collateral and protect their own with 'pre-nuptuals' that guarantee the divorce.  Go make business deals and spend your days and nights studying minutea of statutes and acts...the dead corpse of loveless commercial dualisms.  A lover agrees to not exist.  His only condition is to want whatever she wants....even if she wants him to go away.  Yuk, yuk....how many have the balls or ovaries for that?",
