No, you can't. \n\nYou have only ONE unalienable right; The right not to contract.\nThe rest of your rights, are INALIENABLE rights; Meaning they are LEGALLY PRESUMED unless you have implicitly surrendered them.\n\nYou surrender inalienable rights when you enter commerce, and are a commodity that is bought and sold in commerce.\n\nADMIRALTY is ROMAN law, which is based on PRESUMPTION. When you use MONEY that has a TENDER FOR LAW attached, you don't get to dictate terms after. If you could, do you think I'd waste time trying to teach you vacuum-heads how to create your own money, and what a crypto currency is? :P",
