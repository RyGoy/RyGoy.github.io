   "message": "Greetings Scott, As someone with about 2 year experience following and devouring positions offered by the \"FREE-DUMB\" movement, I have slowly come to realize that I have a fair bit of unlearning to do. Having said that, I assert that may of us, and others who will come along, will be in the same predicament I find myself in. It seems that in the interest of clearing our heads of worthless information, would you please consider making a list of THE TOP TEN THINGS THE \"FREE-DUMB MOVEMENT\" HAS MISINFORMED YOU ABOUT. It would be invaluable to me and others to dispense with myths still rumbling around in our minds. Thank you kindly for considering this proposal.",
