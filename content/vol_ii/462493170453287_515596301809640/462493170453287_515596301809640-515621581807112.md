   "message": "\"NOT ANYBODY\" accesses our TRUST because theirs is a DeFacto  CLAIM (and not a VALID CLAIM)? They don't access our PATRIMONY because it is ours IN LAW unless we TENDER or ACCEPT OTHERWISE. It's  just waiting for us to lien it. OK so far? We break the law by claiming ownership of the BC (which is property of the treasury), and in doings so we LEGALLY become the SURETY for their funny accounting system. Meanwhile, our trust sits patiently waiting for us to lien it?",
