   "message": "VIDEO: THE TRUTH ABOUT CHRISTY CLARK'S POSITION ON PIPELINES, TANKERS\nWritten by Kevin Logan Friday, 10 May 2013 17:37\n\nFrom Common Sense Canadian contributor Kevin Logan comes this multimedia examination of where Premier Christy Clark and the BC Liberal Party really stand on proposed oil pipelines and tankers in BC.\n\nChristy Clark and the BC Liberals have made a lot of bold claims about their position on pipelines proposed for British Columbia.\n\nHOWEVER, WHAT THEY HAVE NEGLECTED TO TELL BRITISH COLUMBIANS IS THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT HAS ENTERED INTO BINDING AGREEMENTS THAT ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF PIPELINES FROM ALBERTA TO THE BC COAST.\n\nEveryone knows there has been a lot of politics surrounding pipeline developments in British Columbia, but very few are aware of the longstanding agreements, established by the BC Liberals, that ensure the success of the proposed pipelines and have thoroughly tied the hands of all BC Stakeholders leaving them with no capacity to actually impact the processes that will ensure the success of these developments.\n\n",
