   "message": "I'm interested in reading the rationale for the rape baby argument...\n\nMy interpretation is that Jo was a gullible bloke who believed the story Mary told about a one night stand with a guy who has not been named & doesn't call...Jesus gets pissed off with his Mum (and his absent father), sees through Mary's lie about the one nighter & hates her for the lie, his old man for not showing up to take him to Disneyland & Jo for being such a gullible prick...\n\nThe Catholic church are absolutely wowed by Mary's ability to lie & keep a straight face, so they place her on a pedestal & Jo gets relegated to dragging the donkey around.",
