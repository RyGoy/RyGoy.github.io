   "message": "CYFS Win, St. John�s NL \nadmin : April 16, 2013 9:57 am : Court Win, News \n In this particular case my friend did not contract. Agents for CYFS (Child Youth and Family Services) showed up at his house over an unsubstantiated allegation of child abuse made by a neighbour. The answer was �I am not contracting with you, go away.�\n\nWhen the agents were denied entry to his house, the CYFS agents went to the school and removed his child. When he went to pick her up after school� NO KID! Taken� based upon accusations of the neighbour.\n\nIn court, the first thing I did was I read The Declaration of Human Rights. Then I established who everyone in the courtroom was. I told them the judge was the Executor, the court clerk was the Trustee, and the client was the Beneficiary.\n\nThen I asked the Crown Lawyer who he was. The response was �I�m the Crown Lawyer�.\n\nI responded �Wrong Answer! That is a legal fiction. Would you agree to the fact that you are also a Trustee?\n\nThe lawyer responded �Yes I would agree with that.�.\n\nThe next thing we did was to argue Institutional Bias and Double Jeopardy (they had laid this charge before already). We then came back to the fact that there was no contract and no claim since it was based purely on hearsay.\n\nAfter much arguing with the crown, (the trustee) I got them to admit that in fact there was no contract, no claim, no cause of action and no jurisdiction, since this was St. John�s and the client lived elsewhere, in short� they had NO power over his �ESTATE�.\n\nThe final ruling was he got his kid back. The Judge (the executor) had no other option. That poor guy had had every right violated.\n\nHappy we got a good RESULT!",
