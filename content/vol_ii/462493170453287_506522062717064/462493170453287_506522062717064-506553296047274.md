   "message": "No, i teach just fine. I have students that learned law from me in six months. No, I can teach people who can think and actually LISTEN.\n\nI CAN teach VERY well and I'm thrilled when my students learn. It's one of my few joys in life.\n\nALL of them are living proof that your conclusion that I CAN'T teach is simply your unwillingness to accept that you don't know what the simplest words in law, mean.",
