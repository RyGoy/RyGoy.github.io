   "message": "Is MONEY not, anything accepted as value? If I wish to own a few bitcoins, can I not offer Scott 6 chickens, a partridge and a small pair tree for a few bitcoins? Did I not PAY Scott with MONEY if my TENDER is accepted? then my PAYMENT = MONEY. Can it be said that OVERLAY NETWORKS = HORSE TRADING? Don't like bitcoin? Make your OWN. ;)  Just loose the legal tender notes... they're only holding you back",
