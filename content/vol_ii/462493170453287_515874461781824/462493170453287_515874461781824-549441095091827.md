   "message": "<<A Notary is a fucking JUDGE in the process known as \"discussion\", which is a common law process.>>\n\nHmmm. Well, let's consider first what a \"judge\" really is. A real judge in ONLY one who is elected by \"the People.\" So a notary, is not a \"judge.\" And almost none of those in the bench are not real judges.\n\nSecondly, it's ALL about SURETY and ACCOUNTING, and that would involve CONTRACT. The rest is all \"busy work.\"\n\nI see it as WE, and our CONTRACT, ARE the court, and \"judge.\" The CONTRACT is the LAW. The notary is just an authorized WITNESS. \n\nIt is US that have the real authority, the real power. And thru CONTRACTS, we establish the LAW.\n\nI may be wrong , but that's how I see it . Please correct me if I'm wrong.",
