   "message": "Yes absolutely the Notary is the most powerful ally the Sui Juris have at their disposal, next in power ONLY to the Sheriff of the county. The Sheriff is the CEO of all of the courts in the county. And the Notary Public is an EXECUTIVE OFFICER of the HIGHEST courts. Not only that. A Notary Public is ranked by executive law ABOVE a justice of the supreme court. This males the notary public a JUDGE. in executive law the notary can perform all of the functions of all of the officers beneath them. The most common judgment for a Notary Public to enter is a DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, but YES, a Notary Public is a judge, a common law judge, and the notary public's realm IS that of NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS. Bills of exchange, drafts, checks, Notes, and other negotiable instruments. You see it is not exactly the NOTARY that is that powerful it is YOU that is this powerful. The Notary Public is just a neutral third party witnessing YOU acting HONORABLY and STATING THE TRUTH UNDER OATH. It is the TRUTH you ATTEST and UNDER OATH, that makes everything so powerful and lawful. YOU are the sovereign, you literally write your own law. Through these notices, these bills of exchange, you offer discussion to avoid conflict. The notary simply witnesses you offering discussion to avoid conflict. And that most honorable COMMON LAW process is your HIGHEST administrative remedy. Notice when you get a ticket you are in administrative court in front of an administrative judge. It is because not for what you did to get a ticket, but because you did not offer discussion to avoid conflict and are in dishonor. You show up to court already in default and dishonor having lost before you open your mouth. The notary public and discussion is how you avoid this. The confusion for notaries comes with the difference between CIVIL law and COMMON law. The COMMON LAW notary, it is true, may ONLY verify identity and witness oaths and attestations with respect to documents for use in CIVIL LAW. The CIVIL LAW notary which is ALL ATTORNEYS, on the flip of that can NOT handle documents for use in COMMON LAW. Now, the Notary Public, may most CERTAINLY handle and exercise quite a few powers and duties with respect to these DOCUMENTS FOR USE IN COMMON LAW, (not civil law). Since the Notary is authorized to HOLD FOR COLLECTION our BILLS OF EXCHANGE, they are of course empowered to carry out any function necessary to achieving that including making certified true copies and effecting service of them. THIS IS NOT PRACTICING LAW. This is the initiation and exercise on the party of the individual presenting the bill of exchange, in exercising a lawful right and making use of a lawful administrative remedy available at law. You MUST offer discussion like this in order to even arrive at a place where you can then enter a civil court in honor ready to initiate an action. The Notary public is how mature responsible adults attempt to avoid conflict. And yes being ranked above a justice of the supreme court they have these masterful powers you can make use of. IF you are honorable. You can completely secure both victory and a lawful judgment without even setting foot in a court room. NO ONE wins or loses any matter IN court, in fact if you get to court you have already lost, lost your time, energy, and even effort even having to defend. But we can minimize the loss by making certain if you ever go to court that YOU will be the only one there, and you will already have a default judgment. YOU define the battlefield using the Notary, YOU win the war. The document linked below shows the entire email string between my notary and I. It is what secured their cooperation and got them to work for me. I actually possess certified mail return receipts regarding my claim of right that show the protest notice went FROM my notary TO my sheriff. And the tracking numbers confirm it also. Through my notary I was able to perfect and CURE my claim of right served upon the sheriff the highest constitutional law enforcement officer in the county. I as of the moment it cured, can no longer be charged under ANY act without an element of harm to another. This email string shows the entire power of the notary clearly spelled out. I even clear up the whole permissive argument in advance. Because the word MAY is used in the wording of the notary laws the notary assumes it means they get to choose when they will perform, but they do not, the word MAY actually means MUST when the right of the public depends upon the performance of the duty, like with protest for non acceptance. \n\nI successfully got the notary to;\n1. Open a file and hold my originals for collection\n2. create certified true copies\n3. effect service of bills of exchange \n4. craft and effect service of Notice of Dishonor\n5. craft and effect service of Notice of Protest for Non Acceptance\n\nThis is the State of New York's Notary laws, a notary in NY is equal to notaries all over the country. I have also linked the document State by state notary laws so you can see the laws for different states and how similar they are. \n\nNY EXEC LAW SEC 138\n\nï¿½138. Powers of notaries public or  other officers who are stockholders, directors, officers or employees of a corporation A notary public, justice of the supreme court, a judge, clerk, deputy clerk, or special deputy clerk of a court, an official examiner of title, or the mayor or recorder of a city, a justice of the peace, surrogate, special surrogate, special county judge, or commissioner of deeds, who is a stockholder, director, officer or employee of a corporation may take the acknowledgment or proof of any party to a written instrument executed to or by such corporation, or administer an oath to any other stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent of such corporation, and such notary public may protest for non-acceptance or non-payment, bills of exchange, drafts, checks, notes and other negotiable instruments owned or held for collection by such corporation; but none of the officers above named shall take the acknowledgment or proof of a written instrument by or to a corporation of which he is a stockholder, director, officer or employee, if such officer taking such acknowledgment or proof be a party executing such instrument, either individually or as representative of such corporation, nor shall a notary public protest any negotiable instruments owned or held for collection by such corporation, if such notary public be individually a party to such instrument, or have a financial interest in the subject of same.
