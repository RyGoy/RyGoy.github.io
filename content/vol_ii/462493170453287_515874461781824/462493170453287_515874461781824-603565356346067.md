   "message": "Thank you. I honestly forgot all about this group. A notary has no obligation to see ID. All they have to do is personally know the individual. What I suggest is that youfind a Notary you KNOW, in person, SOLELY to create an affidavit of identity. From that point forward ALL Notaries MUST accept that affidavit as valid lawful identification. This is the best way to get around that. That being said, like the socialist insecurity number, you always have the option to treat the ID the drivers license or non drivers ID, as a jacket you put on and take off at will. I myself carry no identification of any kind. BUT that doesnt mean you cannot. NO ONE carries ID because they WANT to they all either believe it is obliged by law, or worse, ignorant entities demand it making it impractical to exist without it, this does not create a valid contract for ID, it is done under protest and duress for having no other practical options. So the truth of the matter is that people who are compelled to use government ID for the purposes of commercial entitites, like the purchase of age restricted products etc, are not in contract, they are not engaging in an agreement of consent, but under protest and duress, and as such NO ONE is bound to obey the terms and conditions of those contracts being void ab initio.",
