   "message": "What document was that? Anyways, yes a notary is a judge official witness for 100% sure. If the notary held no power at all and all the documents had no legal effect at all, why would a notary society waste time, resources and public court resources to go after a notary who was actually doing his job. Went on TV News and went on CBC radio and followed around on Facebook and affidavits drawn up from facebook posts and researched court dates they could show up at to service court notices. All this time and effort because it absolutely means nothing. But lets waste time and effort on something that means nothing. See, its not what these douche bags say, its WHAT THEY DO PERIOD.\n\nRe: \"Chief Rock Sino General\" - Freeman guru-to-be?\n\nPostby GC_SDNPBC � Sat Nov 30, 2013 12:45 am\nHere is the text of the order granted by the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver, B.C. today:\n\nNo. S-134883\nVancouver Registry\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA\nBETWEEN:\nTHE SOCIETY OF NOTARIES PUBLIC OF BRITISH COLUMBIA\nPETITIONER\nAND:\nSINO GENERAL also known as SINO CAMERON GENERAL also known as\nCHIEF ROCK also known as HAJISTAHENHWAY, NOTARY PUBLIC\nRESPONDENT\n\nORDER MADE AFTER APPLICATION\n\nBefore Honourable Mr. Justice Bowden Friday, The 29th day of November, 2013\n\nON THE APPLICATION of the petitioner, The Society of Notaries Public of British Columbia, coming on for hearing at The Law Courts, 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver, November. 29, 2013, and on hearing Brian J.
