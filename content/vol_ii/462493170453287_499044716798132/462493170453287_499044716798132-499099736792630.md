   "message": "It would seem that a \"run on the banks\" is being orchestrated to create a financial (possibly global) collapse. This is reminiscent of the run on the banks that lead to the great depression. It would seem that a global financial collapse would be the answer to those that seek a One Word Currency. What I find somewhat confusing is that it all seems so obvious and transparent. Why? Perhaps the message is that we don't have a hope in hell. The tipping point is behind us. Dammed if you do (take money out and start the run on money) and dammed if you don't. Either way you're dammed.",
