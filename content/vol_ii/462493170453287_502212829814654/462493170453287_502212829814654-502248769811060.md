   "message": "yah, wait till it goes as low as you can stand to see it reach and buy all you can. gold DOES NOT OXADIZE (rust), it is the ONLY noble metal that does not, silver tarnishes with sulfur which is in the air from auto exhaust but it attributes very little loss [by weight reduction].\n\nGOLD is used to plate electronics AND is the best conductor of electricity, second to silver and copper, which is why silver plated copper is better.\n\ncopper does oxadize a green tarnish, but stainless steel, is nickle steel and doesnt, likewise nickle IS a very good storage ailbet it does occupy a lot of space [like pre 1983 copper pennies] but at a lower denomination and value per volume.\n\nthe other metals platinum & paladium are used in catalytic converters which is as easy to liquidate as gold & silver. ALL are for the most part rust free if properly stored, easily buried in plastic jars or stored in a private safe at somonelses or a private storage unit.\n\nalternately JEWELRY such as gold chains/bracelets are an easy way to move it out of the country. if your wearing it it is not declared as taxable.",
