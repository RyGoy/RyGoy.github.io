   "message": "Dude,  you don't know what you are talking about,  we chose the name \"Pro-se Winners\" because most people only know \"pro-se\" to mean someone that goes to court and handles their own court cases without an attorney.  We explain the true meaning of pro-se on our show and how to overcome it. It's only the amateurs and beginners in law like most of the patriot movement, constitutionalists and sovereign citizen type who get all caught up in little trivial shit arguing over the meaning of 1 stupid word,  when there are many far more important things to learn like WINNING COURT CASES.  THERE WERE NO WINS AT THE WHIM OF A SUPERNUMERARY TRUSTEE LIKE YOU SAID!  YOU DON'T KNOW US!  -- THERE ARE NO INDIVIDUALS IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES WHO HAS WON CASES IN MANY DIFFERENT AREAS OF CRIMINAL LAW THAN THE GUYS IN MY GROUP!",
