If you send me an e-mail to <rcwcodebuster@aol.com> or <rcwcodebuster@yahoo.com> or <rcwcodebuster@gmail.com> I will send you an e-mail that completely explains that THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED IN THE SIXTH AMENDMENT and that the so called RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED only exists in a GENERAL COURTS MARTIAL and/or a SPECIAL COURT'S MARTIAL or in a INVESTIGATION inside a MILITARY COURT ROOM and prove to everyone that REPRESENTATION ONLY EXISTS IN THE MILITARY STATUTES IN BOTH FEDERAL STATUTES 10 U.S.C. 838 and under STATE STATUTES RCW 38.38.376,  etc.,  the so called RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED ONLY EXISTS INSIDE A MILITARY COURT ROOM,  I am the one who has REVEALED THE GREATEST LEGAL SECRETS IN THE LAST 200 YEARS IN LAW,  AND PROVE THAT EVERYONE VOLUNTEERS TO GO TO PRISON WHEN THEY ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY AT TRIAL.",
