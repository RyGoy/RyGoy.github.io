   "message": "thanks for all the replies. what i had in mind when asking this question was not about eating animals ( i eat meat too), but rather is it ok for people to hurt or kill animals like cats and dogs (for profit) just because they are in the way. ( i work in an animal shelter and we would like to close another shelter down because of the non respect towards animal life, like animals in cages that are too small, killing kittens because there are too many, etc...)",
