For nature's purposes anyway. \nPerhaps vivisection would provide a better morcel to chew this over than meat eating. \nSurvival is survival after all. \nBut when it comes to suffering for vanity or to test weapons etc, do we have the right,? of course we have the choice and the ability, but is it right.?",
