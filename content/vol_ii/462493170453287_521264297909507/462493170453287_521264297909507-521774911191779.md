   "message": "Interesting conversation.  The concept of \"rights\" for animals or humans is largely intangible.  Our animals have the rights we grant them.  People have rights by societal consent. \n\nSome people are more considerate of their animal's welfare than others.  You may face some sort of persecution for kicking your dog; but killing a deer could be considered great for a bar-be-que.  \n\nI guess I'll just vote for the rib eye steak.",
