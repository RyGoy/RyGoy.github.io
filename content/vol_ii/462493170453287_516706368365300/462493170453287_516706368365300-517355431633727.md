Work was carried out from when to when\n2.  Client was invoiced on x number of occasions for $a $b & c$, bringing a sum total of $d\n3.  statement was sent on ?date\n4. notice was sent on ?date\n5. Default was sent on ?date\n(add your evidence/exhibits eg: contracts for work to be done, copies of invoices sent etc)\n\nHave it notarised & sent to the other party, using the notary's address for response within 10 days, point for point re the 'facts' in your affidavit...(an unrebutted affidavit stands as truth in Commerce)...failure to respond point for point will result in a default judgement in your favour (from the notary)\n\nSell the judgement to a debt collection agency if you don't want to deal with it yourself...\n\nOR,\n\nHire a sheriff/bailiff company (I don't know the correct term for Canada) to enforce the judgement & begin seizing property.\n\nOf course this is solely for educational purposes as this is still theoretical knowledge for me that I'm still learning so that I can become much better 'entertained'...\n\nThen take the proceeds & invest in some bitcoin ;-)",
