Even if the past means an hour ago. pardon the generalization, but, every post seems to be filled with the possibility that we can get remedy (for the past) if we follow sound advise. Yet all these threads seem to lead to such final comments as ....you're fucked and there is no remedy. You've been wasting your time looking for a remedy. Sign me, Exasperated!",
