   "message": "So Scott, there seems to be many levels of the \"law\", such as Admirality (statues=lowest?), Roman, Civil, Criminal, Trust (Equity?) Law. It seems like a game, as in \"what trumps what\". Trust Law (as you've stated) is the highest law. So my question is, there seems to be an enforcement on our part to show this?
