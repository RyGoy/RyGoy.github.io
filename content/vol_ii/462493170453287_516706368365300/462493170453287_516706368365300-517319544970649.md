   "message": "I have yet to see instructions on this topic from Dean, Rob, or Scott and quite a few others. They all point to commercial liens as being of paramount importance to achieve success, but, curiously, if not suspiciously, none of them have ever provided a word of guidance on the topic as far as I'm aware. Winston Shrout provides information and teaches Americans on the process. Still waiting patiently and getting more suspicious every day? I for one have requested info on this several times as I am sure many of you have. Hmmmm Curiouser and curiouser. Why the silence?",
