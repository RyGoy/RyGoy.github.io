   "message": "I do see where Scott's coming from. And he has told me to study Maxims-of-Law for they will carry more weight for us in court, if we have to be there. The problem is for instance, my favourite 1978 Supreme Court case Bank of Canada v. Bank of Montreal where Chief Justice Bora Laskin ruled essentially - \"...you cant PAY a debt, because MONEY is GOLD, and a promissory/legal-tender-note is NOT itself MONEY its just a 'promise-to-pay', therefore...the debt is only liquidated once its been DISCHARGED...\"  HOWEVER....what Maxim-of-Law out there could even possibly begin to encompass any or all of that in detail enough for us to use in-lieu of that case?  :/",
