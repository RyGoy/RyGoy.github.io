   "message": "To answer your question Gail- unless Scott knows of a better publication, the most concise source for MAXIMS-of-LAW would be at the back of a Black's Law Dictionary 9th-edition. I think theres about 50 to 60 pages worth of them. I bought mine off amazon.ca for about $80...a rather cheap way to learn the principles-and-guidelines the LAW was intended to be BOUND to operate within",
