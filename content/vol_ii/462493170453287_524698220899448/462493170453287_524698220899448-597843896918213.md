   "message": "\"I signed 2 mortgages totaling $222,000.\" - I think I should lien the instrument on these without notification.\n\n\"I signed 4 auto loans totaling $114,000.\" All were satisfied, so I should look up where they were issued from and Notify them that I would like a check.  \n\n\"I signed 7 equipment loans totaling $89,000.\" - Same thing\n\n\"I have signed $600,000 (est) worth of checks.\" - hmmmm.....Should I notify the banks which they were drawn from?  This seems like a lot of work.... :-/  ahhh....new though....Notify the Federal Reserve!!  and default them when they can't counter my claim!  \n\n\"I have created over $25,000 worth of unsecured credit.\" - Already collapsed these.  But now that I think of it, I had that much of a line, but I probably created a shit ton more than that.  oooppps\n\n\"This totals about $950,000.\" - hmmmm.....I am wondering if I should notify the Secretary of State and see if he has any objection to me liening the NAME for this.  I think proper defaulted notice will be the claim I need to back up the lien.  \n\n\"As I see it, they can leverage this money I have created into 10x as muchï¿½.almost $10 million.\" - I don't know about this really.....If I have the potential to create $10 mil, shouldn't I lien the account for the MAXIMUM potential?  I would think so, but I am not entirely sure....<thinking on it>\n\nI think most of this is proper notice.  If I have defaulted (or possibly answered) questions, my obligation should be done.  Does anyone see anything incorrect here?",
