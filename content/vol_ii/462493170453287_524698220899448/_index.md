   "message": "Scott on the BIRTH CERTIFICATE- thread. . . . .(has been UPDATED towards bottom)\n\nEamonn O Brien: Ok... Got ya. The BC is the only important document...\n\nSo registration of birth notifies the GOVERNMENT of another man/woman in the country. They then create the PERSON for us to use as beneficiary, they are surety and administrator is us also unless we wish to appoint someone else... Like when we write up our last will and testament, we appoint an executor....\n\nPete Daoust: They then create the PERSON for us to use as beneficiary: No, they want us to give it VALUE\n\nScott Duncan: THERE you go!\n\nScott Duncan: NAME attached to VESSEL. That's all it is.\n\nYOUR \"WILL\" is something to research for clarity. Remember, there are NO HOMONYMS IN LAW.\n\nScott Duncan: The record is EXPUNGED when the bankruptcy occurred. That is the \"protection\" the law offers.\n\nThey can just run this cycle forever.\n\nScott Duncan: A bankruptcy trustee must accept it. They have no obligation to.\n\nScott Duncan: You are also in the U.S. You have a slightly different status than the commonwealth.\n\nDerek Moran: bankruptcy trustee = Receiver General Rona Ambrose?\n\nScott Duncan: That's the one!\n\nTell her I said hi.\n\nScott Duncan: BIRTH CERTIFICATES are NOT FEDERAL\n\nScott Duncan: In either country.\n\nScott Duncan: CITIZENSHIP is FEDERAL\n\nDerek Moran: So who would've been 'THE COURT' that appointed Rona Ambrose as the Bankruptcy Trustee?\n\nScott Duncan: Fun Fact. Those born in Washington are NOT considered valid certificates. The Birth CERTIFICATE for The DISTRICT of COLUMBIA is actually considered a \"Coupon\" like a Chuck-e-Cheese ticket.\n\nScott Duncan: Derek, the government is who \"The Court\" appointed. The rest is just busy work..\n\nDerek Moran: 'The Court' = IMF ? (Scott clicked Like on this)\n\nDerek Moran: So do i invite Rona Ambrose to a Federal/Admiralty, or a Court of Equity?\n\nScott Duncan: To do what? If you like her, just ask her out, dude.\n\nDerek Moran: ..tired of being the CARRIER\n\nScott Duncan: Why?\n\nDerek Moran: You mentioned it in a thread i think yesterday.. GOVERNMENT = current Beneficiary of DEREK MORAN\n\nScott Duncan: To your masters?\n\nScott Duncan: Are you going to APPLY?\n\nScott Duncan: Seriously, why do you need to ask them? LIEN THE FUCKER.\n\nDerek Moran: PRAECIPE!\n\nScott Duncan: *sigh*\n\nPete Daoust: create a trust, swing everything you have in it, and go wild....\n\nScott Duncan: Yes...here's the catch...it can't be YOU.\n\nScott Duncan: TRUST. It has to be someone you TRUST.\n\nScott Duncan: It's in the NAME \"TRUST\" if you look real close.\n\nPete Daoust: mmmhhh...who left to be TRUST besides the government\n\nDerek Moran: REVOCATION OF POWER OF ATTORNEY: from hereon in, DEREK MORAN = Executor/Beneficiary..

You HONOUR us by being so KNOWLEDGEABLE of our CLUB RULES!\n\n...except you aren't in the club. Fuck you and what are you gonna do about it?\n\nDerek Moran: MARSHALL McLUHAN: \"Only the small secrets need to be protected. The big ones are kept secret by public incredulity.�\n\nScott Duncan: Government to Derek Moran (About an hour later): Look we feel bad about the \"fuck you\" thing. You're right, it's not fair. How `bout we make it up to you by giving you the CHANCE to APPLY to be a CLUB PLEDGE!\n\nAren't we NICE?\n\nDerek Moran: Well then fuck you right back and im gonna PRAECIPE yer ass in a Court-of-Equity then, my public-servants!\n\nScott Duncan: Dude, if you were who you say you were you wouldn't be in THIS jurisdiction. OUT! If you come back, we'll charge you with \"trespassing\".\n\nDerek Moran: Well then fuck you right back Part II and im gonna MANDAMUS then yer ass in a Court-of-Equity, my public-servants!\n\nScott Duncan: RETURN TO SENDER\n\nScott Duncan: ...unless you are there in real life...and then you are \"Arrested\" and charged with \"trespassing\".\n\nScott Duncan: We warned you!\n\nDerek Moran: ..PRAECIPE yer ass in Federal Court of Admiralty as im still deemed to be a VESSEL?\n\nScott Duncan: So you intend to wage war?\n\nScott Duncan: Where is this vessel?

(1) Every party whose signature appears on a bill is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, deemed to have become a party thereto for value.\n\nScott Duncan: Fun Canadian Legal Fact: DEEMED = CREATE LEGAL FICTION\n\nScott Duncan: Keep that in mind. It's done on purpose. Legalese is grammatically backwards in EVERY language when you try to translate.\n\nDerek Moran: WHOA..... have i just figured-out that my/the Birth/Stock Certificate is waiting for me to claim as soon as i show them the RECEIPT my mommy and daddy were given for it 2 weeks after i was born? (Scott clicked Like on this)\n\nDerek Moran: DEEMED = prima facie in Latin?\n\nDerek Moran DEEMED = 'in the absence of evidence to the contrary'...thats whats so funny about section 57.1, they mention DEEMED 'twice!'\n\nScott Duncan: Derek Moran RE:\"...as i show them the RECEIPT my mommy and daddy were given for it 2 weeks after i was born? \" - It's even simpler than that. A sworn affirmation is all you need. Who's to challenge it. 3 witnesses and/or notarized, and that pretty much covers YOUR obligation.\n\nDerek Moran: Not bound to execute trusts\n\n59.

You have a PERSON and YOU are responsible. You contracted with a TRUST, not a PERSON. The signature PROVES you UNDERSTAND.\n\nThere's ONLY ONE PERSON INVOLVED, YOURS!\n\nTHE PERSON (There IS only one in the transaction) is ALWAYS responsible.\n\nGOVERNMENT is a TRUST.\n\nStuart Stone: Black's magic 6: Securities. Stocks, bonds, notes, convertible debentures, warrants, or other documents that represent a share in a company or a debt owed by a company or government entity. Evidences of obligations to pay money or of rights to participate in earnings and distribution of corporate assets. Instruments giving to their legal holders rights to money or other property; they are therefore instruments which have intrinsic value and are recognized and used as such in the regular channels of commerce.... You have a person & according to the definition of securities, I'm willing to suggest that the birth certificate may fall into the category of, 'or other document that represent a share in a company or a debt owed by a company or government entity' and as we are the 'legal holder' of this document, then the right to life, liberty and... 'security of the person' may just mean that you have the right to collect on that trust/account But, again, as the grantor/beneficiary of that trust account, I'm guessing we need to instruct the trustees & not ask them...there's a certain amount of speculation here (what Scott Duncan would probably call talking out of my ass )\n\nScott Duncan: BIRTH CERTIFICATE = BILL OF LADING\n\nGlad I could help\n\nPete Daoust: Bill of Lading legal definition: A document signed by a carrier (a transporter of goods) or the carrier's representative and issued to a consignor (the shipper of goods) that evidences the receipt of goods for shipment to a specified designation and person.\n\nScott Duncan: Parents were the GRANTOR (one of the parties that created the bill of lading).\n\nListen up and pay attention.\n\nYOU ARE THE CARRIER!\n\nA Truck ACTING AS CARRIER is NOT \"120,000 RonCo Turnip Twaddlers\"!\n\nIT IS, IN FACT, A CARRIER THAT HAS \"120,000 RonCo Turnip Twaddlers\"!\n\nIt's delivering it to YOU (The Beneficiary). It just hasn't arrived yet.\n\nYou don't know that YOU own the CARGO. If you OWN the cargo you are transporting you are no longer in commerce. You are transporting PROPERTY.\n\nDerek Moran: OWN the cargo = TRANSPORTING, TRANSPORTING = no longer in commerce. . . . .CARRIERing cargo = engaged in commerce\n\nScott Duncan: The NAME is the CARGO, and the BIRTH CERTIFICATE is the BILL OF LADING. It's valueless on it's own. Hence the term \"Sold a bill of goods\".\n\nPete Daoust: Two basic types of bills of lading. A straight bill of lading is one in which the goods are consigned to a designated party. An order bill is one in which the goods are consigned to the order of a named party. This distinction is important in determining whether a bill of lading is negotiable (capable of transferring title to the goods covered under it by its delivery or endorsement). If its terms provide that the freight is to be delivered to the bearer (or possessor) of the bill, to the order of a named party, or, as recognized in overseas trade, to a named person or assigns, a bill, as a document of title, is negotiable. In contrast, a straight bill is not negotiable.\n\nPete Daoust: a straight bill is not negotiable\n\nStuart Stone: Ok, got it so far (I think)...so when you lien the name, are you doing it because you haven't been paid for transport/carriage of the goods?\n\nScott Duncan: You are letting the world know that the cargo is in fact YOURS. Nobody has the right to presume your cargo is for commerce now.\n\nScott Duncan: That is ALL a Lien is.\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: is this what I should be looking at? (Scott clicked Like on this)\nhttp://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/P07.pdf\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: A maritime lien is a lien on a vessel, given to secure the claim of a creditor who provided maritime services to the vessel or who suffered an injury from the vessel's use. Maritime liens are sometimes referred to as tacit hypothecation. Maritime liens have little in common with other liens under the laws of most jurisdictions.\n\nThe maritime lien has been described as \"one of the most striking peculiarities of Admiralty law\".[14] A maritime lien constitutes a security interest upon ships of a nature otherwise unknown to the common law or equity. It arises purely by operation of law and exists as a claim upon the property concerned, both secret and invisible, often given priority by statute over other forms of registered security interest.[15] Although characteristics vary under the laws of different countries, it can be described as:\n\na privileged claim, upon maritime property, for service to it or damage done by it,\naccruing from the moment that the claim attaches, travelling with the property unconditionally, enforced by an action in rem.[14]\n\nDerek Moran: An action IN REM, versus, an action IN PERSONAM..... interesting stuff (Scott clicked Like on this)\n\n*UPDATE STARTS HERE*\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: I have a question. I just received a new BC and my name is not all caps at all, has both parents names/origin and only one number on the front. The red number on the back is missing. It says, \"This certificate is a valuable foundation identity document\"\n\nSo are they trying to attach a legal fiction to my name in proper persona?\n\n    Scott Duncan: Manitoba?\n\n    Beverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: No, Alberta\n\n    Beverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: ...there's also a barcode *grumble\n    \n    Scott Duncan: What IS it with these wonky docs? Manitoba has ONE SIGNATURE as well. These are COUPONS.\n\n    Beverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: Yah, one signature, on the plastic money paper\n    \n    Scott Duncan: That isn't a \"Certificate\" any more than Canadian Tire money is.\n    \n    Beverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: Its really a copy of LBR... mostly\n    \n    Derek Moran: I have no red-number on the back of mine, too. Its type-written on the front, starts with a Q.\n    \n    Beverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: Yah but there's no all caps on any name on it... and some weird QR code thingy, beside the bar code\n    \n    Derek Moran: I know a guy in Vegas that has managed to get ahold of what he calls his Treasury Bond- this is what he had to say about all this.. \"don't waste your time on fidelity. unless you have your 'original' BC. The info needed to see how many/and how much it's actual worth is you need the info off the very first one.

What is the deal with the old one? are there now TWO PERSONS floating around in DE FACTO land?\n\nScott Duncan: The other is pulled from circulation. Until it is pulled, then yes, there was 2 of you for a short time.\n\nDerek Moran: My relative thought that it was neat when i held her new one up to the light and showed a WATERMARK\n\nDerek Moran: Of course..

(Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nDerek Moran: Dictionary of Canadian Law, EXCHEQUER BILL: a bank-note, bond, note, debenture, or security that is issued or guaranteed by Her Majesty under the authority of Parliament or the legislature of a province.\n\nDerek Moran: ACQUITTANCE: a written acknowledgment that a debt was paid.\n\nJoel Kinmond: Before Dean Clifford disappeared he started talking about handling all matters through your living voice (There was a latin term). Once you know where and how to stand is he correct in saying that all the paper work in filing is unnecessary?\n\nDerek Moran: EXCHEQUER ACQUIITANCE: a written acknowledgment that a debt was (pre-?)paid, that is issued or guaranteed by Her Majesty under the authority of Parliament or the legislature of a province, in the form of either a bank-note, bond, note, debenture, or security.........? \n\nDerek Moran: BIRTH CERTIFICATE = receipt of/to the EXCHEQUER ACQUITTANCE ? \n\nScott Duncan: She's (The Queen) the KEEPER OF THE TRUST. She HAS TO OBEY ORDERS FROM THE TRUSTEES!\n\nScott Duncan: Joel Kinmond: YOU have it SO backwards.\n\nADMINISTRATORS ARE TRUSTEES.\n\nThe HOLDER/KEEPER ENABLES the trustees. The Keeper follows ALL legal orders of trustees. They HAVE to. THEY represent THE TRUST ITSELF as a TRUST IS NOT A PERSON.\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: What do you think they are trying to do with this BC thing then Scott?\n\nScott Duncan: Beverly May Braaksma: The Austrians \"Couponized\" their money 9 months before Germany Invaded in the 30's.\n\nNORTH AMERICAN UNION - These things are just \"roubles\" until there is a consolidated North American Currency.\n\nThis is WAY sooner than I'd hoped\n\nJoel Kinmond: Germany didn't \"invade\" Austria!\n\nJoel Kinmond: They welcomed them. So I am told...\n\nScott Duncan: Yes Joel, and they had a NICE disposable currency to be brushed aside while the REAL wealth is transferred by MONEY OF ACCOUNT to the invader.\n\nCanada will welcome the US too.\n\nJoel Kinmond: Must I join another Trust to remove myself as assumed Trustee of a Trust I wasn't even aware existed?\n\nScott Duncan: WE ARE AUSTRIA.\n\nJoel Kinmond: Annexed - but not lovin it!\n\nJoel Kinmond: The paper game is THIER game is it not? Sorry, I am struggling with \" to what end\" and I am going for a proper smoke break.\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: Yes Joel, and they had a NICE disposable currency to be brushed aside while the REAL wealth is transferred by MONEY OF ACCOUNT to the invader.\n\nCanada will welcome the US too.\n\nCara Small Atherton: this may be a good place to ask. how is a electronic signature actually an endorsement? I was told that was how they are registering all babies in British Columbia now (online). It can be done the old fashioned way still, I think. What is your experience and knowledge on this?\n\nScott Duncan: Cara Small Atherton hits on an interesting point that I shall cover in MASSIVE articles.\n\nShort answer: IT ISN'T\n\nJason F.
