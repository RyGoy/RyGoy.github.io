   "message": "I think this is the kind of thinking we need to adopt to further our comprehension. I was thinking the other day, my mortgage has been renegotiated a few times over the years, when this happens, the original is paid out and a new one created right? Would this not mean that I could request the valuable instrument back from each bank that held my mortgage? The only one I wouldn't do this for is the present bank holding it because it has not been fulled 'paid' yet.",
