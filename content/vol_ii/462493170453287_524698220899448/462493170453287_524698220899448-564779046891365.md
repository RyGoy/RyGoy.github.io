A sworn affirmation is all you need. Who's to challenge it. 3 witnesses and/or notarized, and that pretty much covers YOUR obligation.\n\nI infer from what Scott was saying, was that the BC should be thought of the same as your coat-check-ticket. If you're done clubbing, or finished your meal at the restaurant where you checked-your-coat, how do you get it back? The establishment just isnt going to give it to ANYBODY. But they will give it back to YOU, once you show them your half of the coat-check-ticket they originally gave you. Im assuming, the Registrar General is sitting around, tapping-his-toe, looking at his watch, wondering exactly when we are going to show him our part of the coat-check-ticket. Remember- they initially tore it in two along the perforated-edging, and stuck their half in the pocket of YOUR coat (the GOODS they're storing.) Except the coat-check-ticket in this example is made out to BEARER, ours...is made out to ORDER/the person named",
