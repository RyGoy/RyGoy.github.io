   "message": "This is what Carlton Weiss had to say about \"sovereigns.\"\n\n<<The \"sovereigns\" I studied with during my research initially had a good point, and the good case law to back up the point. However, as I siced my investigative dogs on the case, I peeled back one layer after another of confusion. I saw the truth about the strict confines of any sovereign�s role in the nation or kingdom of which he is the head. I was somewhat transplanted into the mind of the judges who had decided the cases most \"sovereigns\" rely on today. It became apparent that the case law actually shot sovereigns in the foot by holding over their head an internationally recognized standard they couldn�t practically live up to with their limited financial and natural resources in today�s commercial arena. \n\nIn the end, I didn�t even need to cite legal authorities to prove this to them, though articles like George Mercier�s Invisible Contracts, Richard Lancial�s Benefits Accepted Equals Jurisdiction, James Montgomery�s The United States is Still a British Colony, the Informer�s Fallacy & Myth of the People Being the Sovereign, and timeless classics like William Whiting�s War Powers certainly hit home. The problem most of them face is they invested a lot of time and funds into something that turns out to be false. They thought they held sovereignty but they could now see they voluntarily contracted themselves under suzerainty at best. \n\nTo be truly sovereign in olden times you needed nothing less than� \nA plot of land that you have absolute dominion over; \nA fortified castle strategically placed on the land so as to protect you, the sovereign; \nA military to protect the castle and land; \nWorkers to do maintenance on the castle and land; \nA stockpile of weapons high powered enough to wipe out any threat inside or outside your castle and plot of land; \nA stockpile of gold and silver or material or natural resources to pay the militia, workers and sustain the economy that develops out of daily needs people have when living in self-sustaining communities. This includes a stockpile of financial or natural resources to build up your reserves for tough times; and to top it all off \n\nA full sense of how to negotiate with other people who are in the same position as you (sovereigns), especially those who have bigger weapons than yours and might want to take your castle by force or fraud to consolidate their own empire. \nToday, not much has changed except for what electronic technology has made possible. \n\nTo be truly sovereign nowadays you need nothing less than� \n\nA plot of land that you have absolute title to, even stronger than the protections granted under the castle doctrine \nin Texas. It has to be a title so strong that it is recognized all over the world, not just in one state or country, because real sovereignty is an international quality; \nA fortified compound; \nA militia to protect the compound and land. It has to be more than just guard dogs. It must be an actual military presence that sends a clear message to all within earshot of your land not to invade, much less trespass; \nWorkers to maintain the compound and land; \nA stockpile of weapons or technology powerful enough to stop a modern military offensive against you; \nA stockpile of coined gold and silver to keep you from having to use Federal Reserve Notes or Ameros. You need sufficient natural resources to live on and pay your people with so as to not have to engage in commerce as a sovereign, otherwise you reduce yourself to the status of a merchant and your sovereignty is lost; and to top it all off \nA full understanding of trust law as it pertains to sovereigns as trustees and merchants as beneficiaries, contract law, national security law and negotiable instruments law, as well as the laws of power relating to sovereigns and other heads of state so that you can negotiate with the United States and State governments in a way that doesn�t get you dead, conquered or in prison because those sovereigns had more powerful weapons than yours. \n\nOtherwise, you�ll end up like the Native American nations, many of which gave up their sovereignty to engage in commerce via gambling halls and casinos. The problems you immediately face are all issues of practicality, such as� While you can remove land from the incorporated city or county, your title is not absolute. You cannot effectively exercise absolute title to land as an individual, at least not land that isn�t in the middle of nowhere. This kind of isolation leaves you at risk of invasion and limits your flexibility in the information age. In isolation you have no \"eyes & ears\" out in the rest of the world to stay ahead of other sovereigns looking to expand or consolidate their empire. \"Eyes & ears\" are what give you intelligence to avoid being checkmated; A compound is very expensive to build and difficult to maintain. Independent power, utilities and services need to be installed off-the-grid. For internet access you would need to build your own satellite, maintain your own servers, etc. Regardless, however, if the fort goes so do you because the eggs are all in one basket; \n\nHaving a private military is a direct threat to the United States and State governments who are far too corrupted to appreciate the absolute right of self-defense, much less the right to bear arms on a individual or nationalistic level; \nA stockpile of weapons will attract some unwanted attention. It will deter other sovereign men, but sovereigns like the United States who stockpile tanks and missiles might not deter so easily. Though stockpiling can be done with prudence, especially with some ingenuity, the more firearms you have, the more suspicious other sovereigns will be of your motives behind stockpiling. An arms race then ensues and you face the likelihood of invasion or preemptive strike; \nUsing gold and silver as money with third-parties is very difficult at this point because most third-parties are still under the misconception that Federal Reserve Notes are worth something. You would have to wait until the US economy collapsed, at which time you could use commerce to conquer by buying up property for a fraction of the cost in gold. Even so, when you do so you are technically acting as a merchant, and you are no longer sovereign. \n\nEven if the gold is pre-1933 lightly circulated coin, or the silver is pre-1965 ninety-percent (\"junk\") monetary silver, the sovereign is whoever minted the coin, which would be the United States of America in this case; and If you truly understand trust law as it pertains to sovereigns and merchants, contract law, national security law and  negotiable instruments law, as well as the laws of power relating to sovereigns and other heads of state, you will quickly realize that the people�s sovereignty never truly existed. \n\nWhat�s more, times have changed even more since the idea was first entertained. Our times now make sovereignty a disadvantage in commerce because the moment any sovereign sets foot into the rest of the world to get things done, unless you do business by the barrel of a gun or barter using no currency or coin at all, you automatically give up whatever sovereignty you had by acting as a merchant. This includes use of a license, social security number, registration of an automobile or weapon, etc. >>",
