   "message": "I think there is 2 aspects to this.  I think one is what the PERSON is worth to the ones who created it, and that is about $60k.  So in that case, we are the Creditor to the government for +/- $60k.  But, through the PERSON, we have created more money....and that is where I am confused.  Do we lien the person for ...well say $10mil...or the instruments that were created or both, or plus future value.....",
