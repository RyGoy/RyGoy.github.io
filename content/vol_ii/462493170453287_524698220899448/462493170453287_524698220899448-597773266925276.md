   "message": "Accounting:\nUsing the Person, \nI signed 2 mortgages totaling $222,000.\nI signed 4 auto loans totaling $114,000.\nI signed 7 equipment loans totaling $89,000.\nI have signed $600,000 (est) worth of checks.\nI have created over $25,000 worth of unsecured credit.\nThis totals about $950,000.\nAs I see it, they can leverage this money I have created into 10x as much�.almost $10 million.  Plus, using the NAME, I have made a living and I could possibly do this going forward too�I have paid a shitload of taxes.  \nSo Pierre�.although you may have evidence that the PERSON in your pocket is +/- $60k on debt, I have evidence that I have created over $10 million signing for that PERSON.  I think my lien should start somewhere around $10 million and I should keep track of the money I create and going forward and lien the new money creation maybe once a year.\nDoes this look good?  What does everyone think of this?",
