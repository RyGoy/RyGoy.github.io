   "message": "Scott Duncan Maritime is ALL U.C.C.\n\nWho-are You Frisbey So that is saying UCC is Maritime also?\n\nScott Duncan No, it's law on LAND. Read my UCC article.\n\nDerek Moran I came across an old-post of Scott's where he simply said- \"UCC is ONLY useful to you if you have a fleet-of-ships,\" if that helps\n\nScott Duncan No.\n\nThat debt is there, but the BOND is attached to the Consolidated Revenue Fund to account for, and PAY that debt. It is a stand-alone document that acts as FOUNDATION for contracting a tender.\n\nIt's no different than a share in a corporation, only it's a TRUST.\n\nScott Duncan WTF is \"An Individual\"? An \"individual\" (Which means it can no longer be divided...meaning ONE, meaning SURETY) has some nasty legal liabilities by default!\n\nNEVER EVER use the term \"an individual\" again. EVER.\n\nSo NO, the surety for the name can't lien the name. The claim is already public record. Why would you lien that for which you have surety? The GRANTOR liens the asset, not the debtor (surety).",
