   "message": "WTF is \"An Individual\"? An \"individual\" (Which means it can no longer be divided...meaning ONE, meaning SURETY) has some nasty legal liabilities by default!\n\nNEVER EVER use the term \"an individual\" again. EVER.\n\nSo NO, the surety for the name can't lien the name. The claim is already public record. Why would you lien that for which you have surety? The GRANTOR  liens the asset, not the debtor (surety).",
