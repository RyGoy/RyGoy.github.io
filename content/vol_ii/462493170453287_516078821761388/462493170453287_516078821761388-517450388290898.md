   "message": "I am not sure, but start with your local land registry office, it's not land, but that office used to do it here and there were able to tell me where to go to use ppsa, if using  the correct term.  Also if you lien say a law license, you need to know the proper name of the license and the person's name of course and the Ministry they work for, because the lien must go through the ministry they are licensed under.Bonds on the other hand I haven't found out exactly who underwrites their bonds, but it looks like a license is simple. I will find out soon. Lawyers here it is the Law Society of Upper Canada.  Do cops carry a license or are the just bonded?",
