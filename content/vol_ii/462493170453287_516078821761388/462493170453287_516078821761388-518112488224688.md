   "message": "RCMP put old man's driver's license # on certificate of conviction when he hasn't had one in the last 10 years. Said that they took plants, had them in lock up and destroyed them, when in actuality they left them behind on the shop floor in a bag. Falsified documents to show that they destroyed them. One officer stated what happened when they arrived with community services, but he wasn't even here then. Took a safe and stated there was only money in it, but I found one paper that stated by one officer that there were documents and money in the safe.RCMP told lies to Community Services, and they used it in affidavit to have valid reason to take the kids. They told CS that there 4 or 5 plants when there were only 3, that there was close to a pound of weed in the freezer when there was 6oz. told that the kids rooms were filthy with dirt couldn't see the floor. Which wasn't true. That we had no running water, which wasn't true. That there was dog feces on the kitchen floor, which wasn't true cause we have a hobby farm and the dogs are live stock guardian dogs and aren't allowed in the house.",
