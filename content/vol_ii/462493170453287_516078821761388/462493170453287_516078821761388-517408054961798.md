   "message": "Dean- im reading (slowly, mind you) a book called THE PRACTICE AND JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF ADMIRALTY, pg. VII, see if you get the gist of what its saying:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the...admiralty, as it is at present understood, appears to be of a strangely anomalous kind. Mariners' wages, except where the CONTRACT is under SEAL or is made in an unusual manner; bottomry, and in certain cases only and under many restrictions; and salvage, when the property shipwrecked is not cast ashore; appear to be the ONLY subjects within what is now considered to be its LEGITIMATE cognizance. . .for in the common law books there is no trace of it to be found, that the court of admiralty of England, entertains suits for the mere possession of vessels, though, it NEVER interferes where the TITLE is in CONTROVERSY.\"\n\n..would you not say your TITLE is in CONTROVERSY?",
