   "message": "just a little side note here on the warrant. Apparently when RCMP serve a warrant there has to be an affidavit. And you have a right to request that affidavit. However in our case when we got busted, with our search warrants, there were 2, they used Statutory Declarations. Statutory Declarations are similar to affidavits but they are not sworn to. Anybody have ideas why they used Statutory Declarations?",
