   "message": "Photographing and filming police officers in Canada\nThe Ottawa Citizen has a very good editorial on the practice of police intimidation of citizens who use their cellphone cameras and other devices to record the police.\n\nHere's a summary of what Canadians should know about this:\nThere is no law in Canada that prevents a member of the public from taking photographs or video in a public place (other than some limitations related to sensitive defense installations);\nThere is no law in Canada that prevents a member of the public from taking photographs or video of a police officer executing his or her duties in public or in a location lawfully controlled by the photographer (in fact, police officers have no privacy rights in public when executing their duties);\nPreventing a person from taking photos or video is a prima facie infrigement of a person's Charter rights;\nYou cannot interfere with a police officer's lawful execution of his or her duties, but taking photos or videos does not, in and of itself, constitute interference;\nA police officer cannot take your phone or camera simply for recording him or her, as long as you were not obstructing;\nThese privileges are not reserved to media -- everyone has these rights;\nA police officer cannot make you unlock your phone to show him or her your images; and\nA police officer cannot make you delete any photos.",
