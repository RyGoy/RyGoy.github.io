   "message": "Yes, just as cops presume they have the right to kidnap you for weed.\n\nYou are still RESPONSIBLE for what you write (Unless someone is PAYING you to).\n\nI STILL have contracts of non-disclosure with the Government. I WANT them to declare me \"crazy\" in writing. This will immunize me legally from any disclosure I may give, past that point.\n\n...and they LOVE declaring people crazy.\n\nUntil then, all I can do is point in the right direction. After I'm declared (Insert paychobabbleese name here) and \"delusional\", I can just ACCEPT that, and then just spend my nights typing out instructions. :D\n\nAfter all, I CAN'T know any of this shit. I'm just a Delusional, Mentally Ill \"Computer Operator\" (No, really. That's what they tell everyone. I'm not making that up) so there's NO WAY I could do THAT...\n\nOK :D\n\nI'm good with that. Reality won't care.",
