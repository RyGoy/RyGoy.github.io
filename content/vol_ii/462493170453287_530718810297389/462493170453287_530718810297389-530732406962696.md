   "message": "Ethically no it should not be done as it will affect innocents. But depends on how ethics are percieved as these people eat from the suffering their \"loved one\" administers with pleasure so the question is if you support something are you just as bad. These sames peoples families often act as though they wear the uniform and think their loved ones job gives them the extra privallages also so in that case they should reap the same suffering. But the children know no different and don't deserve to suffer although left to grow up in that enviroment will become just as bad if not worse as the parent. I would publish them as a lesson in humility to show these people their power is not absolute and there will be consequences to their actions. Who knows it may have the knock on effect of making them think twice before they do it again in that case it would be ethically right as you are preventing somebodies future suffering at the hands of these phsycos .",
