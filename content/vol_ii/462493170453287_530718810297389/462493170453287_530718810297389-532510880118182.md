   "message": "Scott- i was talking to this guy a couple weeks ago who fancies himself to know the answer to everything, and he was saying in regards to an organization which had its corporation dissolved a few years ago that you could now go after any of the employees attempting to commit fraud in their personal capacity.\n\nWhat i remember in what he had told me to start-off any letter was- \"To you, in your private capacity...\" - something about, 'you are now accessible to being sued as a result of the corporation being dissolved' - or something like that.\n\nCould you finish off the rest of what i started with- \"To you, in your private capacity...\" - with what one would say in a letter, to someone in such a scenario? Thank you.",
