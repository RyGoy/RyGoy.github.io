   "message": "A NEW LOW in the example here today folks. \n\nMy campaign for a National Kick-a-cop-in-the-face Day is spiced up by THIS little gem.\n\nAgain, non-violent, and victimless \"crime\". It's just a matter of time before cops get blowback on a personal level. History has shown this...\n\n...on another subject (Completely Unrelated) I'm just wondering...\n\nIf someone...say (hypothetically of course) ME... were to have the entire account holder list of a financial institution... say.. ummmm. a hypothetical CREDIT union. For the sake of example, say... The Toronto Police Credit Union...\n\nSuppose (hypothetically of course) that they once had a branch on Yonge street and had to transfer it because the building was being knocked down...\n\n...suppose someone with mad skillz were to take a low-level tech position and get paid a slave wage for the gruelling work of a  branch move... and used that access to get all account information...\n\nI guess my question,  being an ethical one, is: If I were to (hypothetically of course) publish all that information (Name address date of birth, etc.) ... would that be a BAD thing? :D\n\nJust asking.
