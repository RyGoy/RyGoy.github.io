   "message": "Scott Duncan it's not that I suffer from a complete lack of empathy as i see it i do however lack sympathy for the most part for what causes these problems and their support networks. \"Good men don't need rules\" I somewhat disagree because i have very little rules and manage not to leave a big body count because i simply don't want to not because i am incapable because i know there is no everlasting consequence to me doing so and could very easily do it and it would bother me less than if it was a puppy strangely. That is what is wrong with me i see this i need to change this i am a product of my enviroment i grew up in a place the polar opposite of where you did and it was dog eat dog and I ate everyone that ever came , i simply do not want to be like this and live a happy life i do not want power it does not attract me.",
