Stop feeding dreams unless you know WHY you want them.\n\nI think if you examine it, you don't have an answer, outside of \"because this sucks\". NEVER make life decisions based on making something bad stop... Unless you are a battered woman, in which case... GET OUT!\n\n...otherwise your entire life will be a \"reaction\" to something \"bad\".",
