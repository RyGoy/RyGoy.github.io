   "message": "My question for today is.\n\nDoes the 'NOTICE OF MISTAKE'  Establish one's own sovereignty and thus by doing so give title of nobility.  \n\nhaving said that does this not also end the contract we had ?  so I was thinking and if I do that I better have a boat to be living on because of the safe harbor.
