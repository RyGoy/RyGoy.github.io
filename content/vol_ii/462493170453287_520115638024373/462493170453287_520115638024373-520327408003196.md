   "message": "'Members of the Private Bar Guild presume you.......' etc etc...Members of a private group wish to involve me in their private business...says it all really...they even gave me the paperwork...If they are able to presume this, then they must be able to 'presume' a valid employment contract, timesheets, payslips, holiday pay, long service leave etc...\n\nThe NOTICE OF MISTAKE clarifies this error in presumption because I can't resign if I'm not formally 'employed' in the first place, regardless of their private presumptions and private clubhouse rules.\n\nI was given the paperwork to become an employee & they never hired me & I never started work...I'm just making sure that mistake is made clear whenever I deal with them...nothing more, nothing less.",
