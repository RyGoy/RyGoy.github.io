   "message": "I wish I had have known this a few months ago; even though, when stopped by the police, I had advised them that they had no authority over me, referring them to Pt2, s8, ss3, 4 & 5 of the Corporations(Qld) Act, to which the police denied having any knowledge of that act and proceeded to arrest me for an alleged non-victim offence. I was incarcerated for 6 hours. I have yet to appear before a court.",
