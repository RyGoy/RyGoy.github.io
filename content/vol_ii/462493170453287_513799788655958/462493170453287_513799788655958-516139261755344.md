   "message": "Just got back from 'court' interesting.  I submitted my notice of mistake with the birth certif. attached.  gave a copy to the crown.  The justice tried to give it back to me, I wouldn't accept it, they left it on the counter.  The crown lady grabs it and puts it on the podium where I was standing, I didn't touch it. I am sending  her a letter thanking her for willingly accepting surety for the legal person and reminding her of the obligations and duties she has accepted.  Also, she was drinking coffee in the courtroom, a big no no.  So I will be putting a lien on  her law license, to the tune of $50,000.00.  That should stop the coffee drinking problem!!  Who do these people think they are?",
