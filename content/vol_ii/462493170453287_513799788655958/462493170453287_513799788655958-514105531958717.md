   "message": "I was recently offered disclosure after making it very clear I was attending under duress and, inter alia, jurisdiction was being denied.   I refused disclosure and said that is not something for me it is for something an \"accused\" (whatever the hell that is - all I know for sure is it's not me).  I made it clear that if it was the Crown's submission that I was the \"accused\" that I would not be relieving the Crown of the burden of proving I am the \"accused\" by taking something which only that fiction is entitled to receive.   There are two questions you will note are repeatedly asked by the judge.  One, are you going to be retaining counsel? And two, have you received disclosure?  Perhaps an similar analogy to those two questions would be asking Scott if he has ever been fitted for an IUD or had a hyterectomy. Know who you are and what applies to you!",
