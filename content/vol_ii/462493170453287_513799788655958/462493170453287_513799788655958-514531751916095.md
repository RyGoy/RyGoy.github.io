   "message": "Wayyy down this page i wrote about a group in Brampton who were taken to court for having the NERVE to discharge their mortgages successfully with an Electronic Funds Transfer. As the story goes, one guy had a Judge/Justice who obviously was on the banks side. This guy calmy collected himself, leaned back in his chair, had a pondering look upon him, and commented to the Judge in a matter-of-fact tone- \"Hmm, i gotta say, you know what? Seems like the court is showing some BIAS against me.(paraphrasing)\" His friend who was there telling me the story SWEARS he's never seen anything like it, how like a switch had been turned on, this Judge seemed alarmed/startled by what had been said, almost worried, and thereon in, did a complete 180. The friend said the Judge acted COMPLETELY different towards his friend, and completely impartial, from obviously siding with the bank initially, to actually seeming like he was now siding with his friend. ALL this guy did, without getting his shorts-in-a-knot, in a non-adverse way, SIMPLY mentioned in passing that he felt there was BIAS being shown against him, and it completely turned his hearing around for the better dealing with the Judge. For what its worth, Philip... ;)",
