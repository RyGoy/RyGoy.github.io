   "message": "I believe they maintain their law license, I doubt any of them would give it up even if they could. In Ontario, you can put a lien on it for $28.00 and $8.00 a year after that through PPSA,  Thanks to DEREK HILL for letting me know about that!!  So once their license has a lien on it, in the immortal words of Donald Trump, YOU'RE FIRED!!!",
