   "message": "Ontario court of justice. The crown looked upset and the JP asked me if my name was on it, I said I didn't look at it, it was given to me by mistake.  If there had been a Judge I would have used the notice of mistake and the old point of order.  Tomorrow there will be a judge and I will use it on him!",
