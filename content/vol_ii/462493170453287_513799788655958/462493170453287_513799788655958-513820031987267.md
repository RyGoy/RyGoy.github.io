   "message": "Because if you have, PHILIP LAFORET is already in the custody of the court. If you followed all proper instructions of HOW to use the \"NOTICE OF MISTAKE\", and understand WHY is it that it can be used, you should know that boths issues of SURETY and ACCOUNTING,  have been resolved.  The PERSON they were looking for has APPEARED, and is now in CUSTODY of the Court, and any ACCOUNTING should be SETTLED by the SURETY BOND. \n\nNow, if you DON'T have filed the BC, how could you have \"used\" the \"NOTICE OF MISTAKE\"? The NOTICE OF MISTAKE is to give NOTICE that the REAL PHILIP LAFORET has now appeared, and is in the CUSTODY of the Court, and separate SURETY from the Living MAN. Since there is no PHILIP LAFORET in the file, (as your notice should had said), their presumptions still stand.\n\nIt looks like you don't understand whats happening, and they know you have no clue to what it's going on.\n\nWhat should you do at this point? That would require some pulling some stuff out of my ass.",
