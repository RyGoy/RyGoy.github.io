   "message": "Got ya!! Thanks! The reason i the BC was not put in at first was because I wan in the Klink and I had someone else file the notice and they would not take it in the file.  So when I got out I tried to have it put in the file through the office? (not in the courtroom), they would not accept it.  Now I understand to put in, in the courtroom!  Scott some of us are slow learners, but willing students!  Not exactly second nature, I'm a wiz bang at embalming though!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!",
