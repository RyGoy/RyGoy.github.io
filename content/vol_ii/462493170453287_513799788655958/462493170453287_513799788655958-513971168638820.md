   "message": "Yes be careful, they will come after you! Get rid of your letter box, it gives them jurisdiction to your property! Also remove any welcome mats or signs you may have because it is actually an invite and put up a notice on your front gate and front door, claiming private property and forbid government agents including the Police Company from any consent to enter! This will stop the police at the gate. Unless you have caused harm on person or property. Forgive me if your way past this point.",
