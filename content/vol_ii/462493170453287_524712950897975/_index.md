   "message": "Scott on what a PASSPORT really is. . . . .\n\nJoel Kinmond: The only endorsement in my passport is digital. No one here seems to care that there is no ink signature of mine on it!\n\nCara Small Atherton: this may be a good place to ask. how is a electronic signature actually an endorsement? I was told that was how they are registering all babies in British Columbia now (online). It can be done the old fashioned way still, I think. What is your experience and knowledge on this?\n\nScott Duncan: Cara Small Atherton hits on an interesting point that I shall cover in MASSIVE articles.\n\nShort answer: IT ISN'T\n\nCara Small Atherton: I would think a passport is an entirely different matter\n\nScott Duncan: Passport = MONEY. It's a \"Bank Book\" of the PERSON/GOVERNMENT credit you carry with you to foreign Jurisdiction. This is why a Passport from CANADA is worth more than a passport from Lebanon.\n\nJoel Kinmond: what if I just want to explore... They didn't like that question and I had to show my passport or be denied entry. I guess I didn't speak the magic words...\n\nScott Duncan: EXPLORE implies the land is not occupied.\n\nJoel Kinmond: Whats the magic word Scott?\n\nJoel Kinmond: And, is there a way for me to access the credit and or use it as a medium of exchange - short of selling it - which I would not even consider, because it isn't \"MINE\"\n\nScott Duncan: There is none. Don't cross at checkpoints.\n\nScott Duncan: NO. Stop trying to access credit that has nothing to do with you.\n\nJoel Kinmond: OK. Why does the passport say I must sign it for it to be valid. Yet this is not the case here. Who fucked up me, the immigration dude?\n\nScott Duncan: Joel Kinmond: YOU have it SO backwards.\n\nADMINISTRATORS ARE TRUSTEES.\n\nThe HOLDER/KEEPER ENABLES the trustees. The Keeper follows ALL legal orders of trustees. They HAVE to. THEY represent THE TRUST ITSELF as a TRUST IS NOT A PERSON.\n\nJason F. LeBlanc: Have expired passport that is signed. Any Value in this?\n\nJoel Kinmond expired See: back, dead, defunct, lifeless, obsolete, outdated, outmoded. (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)",
