   "message": "If we are to be considered 'citizens', does that imply an exchange of allegiance for protection?\n\nDoes that further imply the creation of a nations of belligerents...or a belligerent nation?\n\nAs a result, do we then become privateers, ie: 'legal' pirates, to plunder/salvage for profit?\n\nDoes the process of liking and or contributing imply the acceptance of a tender for law, implying a superior contract?\n\nAs a consequence, does that preclude/prevent any lurkers/infiltrators from being able to use what they find to hold any of the 'citizens' to account for their actions?\n\nDoes this process enable Scott Duncan et al to create a real world episode/series of Pinky & the (Girl) Brain?\n\nAm I reading waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much into all this? ;-)",
