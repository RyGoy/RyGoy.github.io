   "message": "Ok, I am trying to figure out what is wrong with this picture: \n\nThese fellas in Alberta are setting up an Embassy and creating driver's/vehicle licenses for anyone who wants to what, join? They want to buy up a bunch of land for housing and such, I think. If an Embassy is a diplomatic mission, which is still under International Law, would they basically be setting up a commune? Essentially the plan is to launch everyone out with new ID and plates for their vehicles and the Ambassador will what... protect them when they all get pulled over and their cars stolen?\n\nHow could this Embassy thing work?",
