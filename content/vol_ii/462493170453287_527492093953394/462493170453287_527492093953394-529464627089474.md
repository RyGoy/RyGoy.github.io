I see you.\n\nScott Duncan Yes I know that, but we have already proven the \"stupid\" factor. You aren't QUALIFIED to \"speculate\". I'm not speaking yiddish here. I write the Queen's English, so you cannot be confused.\n\nYour ass is not a library, so stop pulling your answers/speculation out of it.\n\nI coulda swore ive heard you ALSO say on here- \"We dont do CRYPTIC on this page\"...so who/what is Cory Black then?",
