   "message": "Ah...thanks? \nBank crisis...and we discuss definitions and etymologies...ok...\n\nHmmmmm....\nModern usage\nWhile the word regime originates as a synonym for any form of government, modern usage often gives the term a negative connotation, implying an authoritariangovernment or dictatorship. Webster's definition states that the word regime refers simply to a form of government,[1] while Oxford English Dictionary defines regime as \"a government, especially an authoritarian one\".[2] Nowadays the political use the word regime is most commonly applied to any government that is most of the time not democratically elected and imposes strict and often arbitrary rules and laws on the people that are, because of the undemocratic nature of the government, non-negotiable.\n\nIt's this \"modern\" definition\" that my SIDE COMMENT was referencing..but thanks for clarifying a word I've been using for over forty years. \nSome things don't need to be googled.\nShit...good thing I didn't say \" I smoked a fag\" or said \"I'm feeling gay\" ...who knows what I would mean...is we are going by strictly one definition or the other, and not understanding things in the context they are meant.\nSorry I didn't clarify...methinks more important shit needs to be discussed on this OP,and as such didn't provide a glossary of terms for every word I wrote.\n\nMy bad",
