If you DID, you'd never be mislead, or waste time (Your only TRUE asset).Your brain was available and IS available, even now. The problem is that you think wrong, and value the wrong things. You manufactured your own ignorance, and have given away the best parts of who you are, for \"belief\".\n\nWhen you try to engage your brain, when it's needed, the reality that you cannot tell the difference between what's true, and what feels good sinks in. Your brain doesn't work because you think \"We use what we have available\" is a valid position.\n\n...I am therefore calling you dumb. (Which happens to disprove the whole \"No body calls me dumb for doing the best I can with what I have at hand\" position)",
