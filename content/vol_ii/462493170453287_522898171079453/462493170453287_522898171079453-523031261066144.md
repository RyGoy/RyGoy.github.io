   "message": "The WRONG answer consumes your ONLY valuable resource; YOUR TIME. The expectation that I must abide people who are DEMONSTRABLY WRONG is a THEFT of my only valuable resource.\n\nI myself am here for EXACTLY THE WRONG REASONS, and for most of you reading, this will only ever be \"pearls before swine\". I don't really care. I'm keeping a promise to those worthy of MY time. That's it. I keep my promises. I write here for NO OTHER REASON.\n\nI am about to take something from all of you that you don't even know exists yet, muchless understand its VALUE, but I have to make you mentally capable of grasping it before I lay my claim.\n\n...after I lay my claim, I want you to come back here, and you can suck on \"agree to disagree\", because there won't be a thing you can do to get it back, once I have control of it. ;)",
