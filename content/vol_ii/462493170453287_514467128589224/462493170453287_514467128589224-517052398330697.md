   "message": "i have to agree with scott.\n\ngovernment workers are by far the useless. They don't do anything other than take maybe a 6 hour course on how to handle people and then get some stupid certification and can work for the government(my friend did this so i know).\n\nthey dont know anything outside of their job. The only reason they are there is because they couldnt find a job somewhere else meaningful so they go to government to feed themselves and family.\n\nI refer to the general workforce, there is always few exceptions.",
