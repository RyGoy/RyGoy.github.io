   "message": "Chad, you don't need actual people to search visual data. OpenCV can do it. It's not that hard to go through a terabyte of data if you can identify your target.\n\nHere is something FAR harder for visual input to do...identify targets in real-time. Recorded stuff isn't even real-time! OpenCV just searched for pictures of Tara Duncan in m 3 TB archive. Found, 11000 and put the faces it detected in a single contact sheet.\n\nIt took about 1 minute. That's it being lazy, with a crappy bash script calling OpenCV with switches.",
