   "message": "It is a special day here on THE TENDER FOR LAW, as Pierre has made his first post that wasn't completely and utterly content free.  In one of our many exciting and engaging threads, Pierre asked the following questions:\n\n1). Do you really think some government agents are following this group?\n\nand\n\n2). If some do, are they NOT just going to quit their stupid jobs and figure out that they are really missing the boat ?\n\nThis is a complex issue and deserved an article on its own.\n\nI am currently resurfacing the upper deck of the Tycho-Brahe and you should all feel really guilty that this, writing endeavour, is interrupting my hot, back-breaking manual labour which involves necessary but otherwise pointless suffering...so you'd better appreciate everything this has to offer.\n\n1st question: �Do you really think some government agents are following this group?�\n\nAnswering this one is really easy:  Yes. In fact they've said so.\n\nTo think otherwise would imply a level of self-deception that would probably render you catatonic.  In fact, the only reason this group exists is because I KNOW the GOVERNMENT is reading it.  Everything I type here I type ON PURPOSE.  \n\nAs often as they try to insert a voice, their efforts get rendered futile by the rules of my little autocracy here.  Jimmy Carter once commented that the reason he was such an effective diplomat was that he always dealt with dictatorships...and shit gets done under dictatorships.\n\nMy policy eliminates the flawed notion that your ignorance is equal to my knowledge.  There's no �fair and balanced� here, there's right and wrong.  The only freedom you have here is to get the fuck out and never come back � you're free to do that at any time.  It is MY autocracy.  I made it, and I shall rule it as long as I deem necessary.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause �FUCK OFF� that's why!\n\nWith every word I type (or dictate ;)) my goal for THE TENDER FOR LAW is being fulfilled.  As far as you should be concerned it serves no other purpose.\n\n2nd question: �If some do, are they NOT just going to quit their stupid jobs and figure out that they are really missing the boat?�  The short answer is, �No�, and the reasons why, are systemic.  \n\nAsk yourself, �What is a government worker?�  \n\nWhen you, ACTUALLY LOOK, and realize that they don't actually do anything; they don't make anything, and any benefit they get (including their salaries) was taken from someone else, this becomes PAINFULLY clear, and you wonder how you thought they were anything else.\n\nIf you try to get a government job, it's very difficult...unless you are related-to, and/or know someone, who already works for the government.  \n\nEvery once in a while the issues of nepotism and crony-ism crops up by vocal members of the public, and the expensive, time-consuming and inevitably pointless �public hearing� on the issue will make a �500-page legal ruling� which essentially says �We agree that nepotism and crony-ism is a bad thing�, and the issue is considered closed (..except for the collection of tax dollars that will be needed to fund this \"fair and balanced\" report, of course!).\n\nSuch cancers on the PUBLIC TRUST aren't terminal in a healthy government, especially if policies exist to expel them; and to destroy the problem before it becomes a problem.\n\nEvery government in the Commonwealth has such a legal mechanism � referendums being the most familiar.  Even with those protections, you will find that everyone, in every Commonwealth county, will feel the same way about government workers!  \n\nThey have gone from being �holders of the PUBLIC TRUST� to �worthless eaters at the trough�.  Though it's hard to imagine; I want you to picture yourself at a point in life (say, in your 40's or 50's) where you know, beyond any reasonable doubt, that you can't actually do anything, don't actually know anything, and can provide nothing that anybody wants.  This makes you perfect for government work!\n\nDo you honestly think a government worker doesn't know he/she is a worthless sack of shit?  \n\nDo you really think the fat, useless old man who holds the Senior Government position, once bounced on his father's lap and said, �Daddy, can I push paper for the Attorney General when I grow up?�  \n\nAnd do you think his daddy looked at him with hope and pride, exclaiming, �You can be anything you want son�!\n\nWhat about Children's Aid Society workers (CAS)?  Do you really think the fat, ugly, tub-of-shit that no man would fuck on a dare, muchless have a baby with, once crushed her mother's lap, and said, �Mommy, can I steal other people's children when I grow up?�  \n\nNO!\n\nThat ugly sack of shit, sees herself in the mirror in the morning, and knows, absolutely and categorically, that she's an ugly sack-of-shit, who's bitter, and harms those who have what she wants, and calling it \"important work\".\n\nThat fat, middle-aged man pushing paper for the Attorney General, also knows he's a useless sack-of-shit who couldn't make a living in the real world.\n\nNot only do they read what I'm writing, they know, FOR A FACT, that what I'm saying is true! \n\nUnfortunately for all of US; for them to acknowledge that, would be to cut off the revenue stream, that feeds their families, at other people's expense.\n\nSo yes, Pierre, they do watch, and they do know what I'm saying is true.\n\nIt just doesn't matter to them; because the only way they can have the illusion of self-actualization and worth, and to feed their families, is to be worthless, useless, child-stealing sacks-of-shit.  Would you let your family starve?\n\nIf the only way you could feed your family would be to assume the role of paper-pushing/child-stealing/citizen-beating/home-invading, worthless sack-of-shit...wouldn't you do it?\n\nThe infrastructure of the government consists of middle-aged, stupid/incapable people, who where brought into the position, by a previous generation of middle-aged/stupid people, who were brought in by a previous generation of people who fought in a bloody, pointless war and chose to avail themselves of the benefits of �Civil Service�.  \n\nThere was a time, right here in Canada, that you weren't paid to work for the government.  You did it as �service�, and you were rightfully revered for the position, for it was a position of TRUST. Only after 1933, was government ever a way to �make a living�.  Here in reality, government workers make YOUR LIVING. They take from you, to breed another generation of stupid/incapable people that the real world doesn't want.\n\nThe �real world� doesn't want me either, but I am not responsible for the wants and desires of others (although Tara will tell you I am in fact responsible for every want and desire she has...and I'd best make sure she has them if I know what's good for me...I digress).\n\nSo...just remember that Pierre, every worthless, sack-of-shit in government already knows they're a worthless, sack-of-shit.\n\nOne of my larger goals in my public initiatives (THE TENDER FOR LAW being but one of them), is to eventually provide absolute, conclusive, irrefutable proof, so when you try to wake up your friends and neighbours, you won't have to say, �I know a guy who knows a guy�...you will be able to point to it and to say, �Here's the proof.�  \n\nRemember I'm the guy who pays all his taxes, who PAID OFF his mortgage, and had guns pointed at him and his home stolen, because he would not cede jurisdiction, and would not have his UNALIENABLE RIGHT not to contract ignored.\n\nEverything has been meticulously documented, and the corruption of the system will become self-evident.  When they question the �authorities� about what I say, the response will only reinforce my position.\n\nI want the government the way it SHOULD be; TERRIFIED of its citizens.  Those with authority in the PUBLIC TRUST should have sleepless nights worrying about what the citizenry might do to them if they step out of line.\n\nPUBLIC TRUST and PRIVATE TRUST is no different.  You will have no problem seeing the nature and depth of the offence, when somebody betrays your trust, and I'm sure you have no problem expressing it when it happens.  Yet people in the PUBLIC TRUST, when they do the same, get away with saying, �Ya, well...that's just the way it is. C'est la vie.�  \n\nWhy is that?\n\nWhy is one breach of trust unforgivable, but the other is �just the way it is�?\n\nEVERYTHING IN GOVERNMENT IS ENGINEERED TO MAINTAIN THAT �JUST THE WAY IT IS� MENTALITY IN THE PUBLIC.  IT SERVES NO OTHER PURPOSE.\n\n...and to counter the inevitable, �we need government for hospitals, roads and schools�, as if these things don't occur as a matter of course:  Even the most backward, primitive villages in Tzshitholeistan, will have a road coming into the village, and executive to administer policy, and minimal �public services� to accommodate the village.\n\nAll we have left now is worthless people who contribute nothing, implementing �Might makes right� policies, if you dare say ANYTHING against the cry �Respect MA ATHORITAH�!\n\nYou have but to look over at Dean Clifford to see this mentality in play.  Those very same government workers who know that they're worthless sacks-of-shit living off your labour to feed their worthless sack-of-shit families [hereafter: Worthless breeder], look at people like me publishing what I do, and people like Dean, publishing what he does, and even the Grand Poobah of the FREE-DUMB Movement, Robert Menard, and you can imagine the pressure they are feeling.  For anyone examining the issue, at bare minimum will conclude, that ONE of us is right; and that what exists right now, is NOT EVEN CLOSE to \"RIGHT\".\n\nLike a cornered animal, I feel these worthless breeders will actually harm Dean Clifford, and that's a bell that can't be un-rung.  Too many people will see this happen.  I'll make sure of that.  \n\nSo to conclude, \n\n1: Thank you Pierre, for finally asking something relevant; and I no longer think you're a waste of oxygen that should be ground up for filler, in pet food.\n\n2: It is unlikely that anyone observing these pages for, or on behalf of, any government entity will assimilate the message, change their opinions, or become a force for public good.  Those who live fantasy existences, whether inspired by religion, wealth, or a job in the public sector, cannot afford to let even the smallest amount of doubt seep into their �realities�. They can't, without questioning every facet of who, and what, they are. \n\nIn seeking to maintain their view of the status quo, they will fight, by whatever means necessary, to maintain their rose-coloured illusions that everything is fine and nothing is broken.\n\nUltimately if they cannot stem the tide of public opinion by sticking their fingers in their ears, they will even seek to silence those with dissenting opinions. To do otherwise would force them to acknowledge themselves as dysfunctional and an integral part of a broken system.",
