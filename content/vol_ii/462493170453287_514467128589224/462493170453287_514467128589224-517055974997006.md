The only job at the time was a government administrative desk job with the government.\n\nA young man got into a car accident and needed extra cash to do his nightly job. He seeks a job with the government for 3 months in order to help pay for a new car or to repair the current one.\n\nA single woman  with 3 children had a night job as a waitress, she gets reduced shifts because of layoffs and poor business. She seeks another job during the day in order to help with the loss of money to help feed her family. She seeks a government job because of the reliability and the steady shifts.\n\nJust on the top of my head. Scott not everyone spent time into law, they have different paths. Not everyone has the same amount of knowledge as you.",
