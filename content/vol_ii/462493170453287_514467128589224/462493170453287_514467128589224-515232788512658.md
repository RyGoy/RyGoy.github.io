   "message": "I did answer that. These are people who would starve in the real world. They make NOTHING. They HAVE nothing the world needs. These really are \"worthless eaters\" who are attracted to the Government.It doesn't matter what motivates strangers who mean you harm.\n\nI don't care what motivates some worthless sack of shit to take a stranger's child, or hurt someone because they don't \"respect their authority\". Why would anyone care what motivates them? Are you planning to stalk and kill them? no? Then \"examining their motivations\" is a waste.\n\nWomen in Oslo don't care about the motivations of the muslim man who thinks \"allah\" gives him the \"right\" to rape them.\n\nThere comes a time when your love of \"belief\" becomes irrelevant and you just become a sack of shit.",
