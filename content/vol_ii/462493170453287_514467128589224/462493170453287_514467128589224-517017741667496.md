   "message": "So... your SISTER became a \"worthless eater\". You must be so proud.\n\n...who'd she know to get in? I GUARANTEE it's a useless, unskilled middle-aged \"worthless eater\". Disagree all you like, but there is nobody at the helm in government. Commercial interests nudge it in their favour, but no thinking man or woman works for the government, no matter how much you \"disagree\".\n\nClaiming there is anything else besides \"worthless eaters/breeders\" in government, is a claim I put on the same shelf as Unicorns and Faeries.",
