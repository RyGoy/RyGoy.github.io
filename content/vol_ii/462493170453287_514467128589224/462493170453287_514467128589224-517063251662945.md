   "message": "How YOU feel is so profoundly irrelevant, I can't think in scales that small. \n\nHere in reality you are saying \"they stopped raping the public so they're fine now\". I'm sure they gave back all the money they were paid, just as soon as they realized it was taken from somebody else!\n\nPaul Bernardo isn't kidnapping and raping teenage girls anymore either, so I guess he's a \"good guy\" because he stopped.\n\nI really hope you teach your child to think like you, so I can watch the formation of stupidity that will result, grow so massive, that it collapses into a fatal black hole of stupid.",
