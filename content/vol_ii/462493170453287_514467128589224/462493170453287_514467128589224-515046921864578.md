   "message": "Well, I'm not inspired. Words people utter do not persuade me to go out and wave some flag on their behalf in response. And I am not emotionally aroused either. Those that orate from emotion are usually as deep as a fucking car park puddle after a light shower. Neither am I impressed. To be impressed by the words or deeds of another is to fall into the category of follower or another bloody sheep. I stand alone. Why?... Because it is my fucking inalienable right. Let some bastard try and take that from me. What I can say about what you wrote here Scott, quite simply is - that I agree with what you state above. Whole-heartedly. What I choose to do with what you have said, is my business. But I do believe that it is a statement of fact that needs to be sent to every Commonwealth Politician and government agent. Thank you for sharing your honesty.",
