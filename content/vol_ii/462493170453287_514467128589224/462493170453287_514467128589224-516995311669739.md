   "message": "whoa... heavy mother fucking thread.\nAnd here I come to piss everyone off.\n\nOk, Scott, you first. You are not completely right. But damn close. You said ONE thing wrong:\nIf you try to get a government job, it's very difficult...unless you are related-to, and/or know someone, who already works for the government. \nNot true. A generalization from a wold fast fadng.\n\nYou also said:\nThe infrastructure of the government consists of middle-aged, stupid/incapable people, who where brought into the position, by a previous generation of middle-aged/stupid people, who were brought in by a previous generation of people who fought in a bloody, pointless war and chose to avail themselves of the benefits of �Civil Service�. \n\nWrong again dude. Youll note I said ONE thing I disagree with but actually lsted TWO? They are the same thing. \nAnd youre incorrect.\nAn example to prove youre wrong: My sister\nYou really dont know WHO is in here...or WHO their family might be.\n\nFYI? Shit...one of the biggest conspiracy theorists I know of...is so high up in a particular area of the government that ould leave you ALL in serious disbelif. So, not only are some YOUNG High ups reading, tey already are on point with what really \"going down\". Theres more to this and certain theories in effect I wont tal about, but...nah, youre wrong. Not all in \"higher\" positions (and I mean positions that have to yell down a long way for Harper to hear them) are of the old school or the old school mentality. YOU..have NO IDEA. And I cant say more ok? Just trust me on that.\n\nAs for all this muslim talk?\nYoure all fucking nuts. Listen, I just so happened to get a real refresh on Islam...from someone who ALWAYS warns me to NEVER bash them in public. They are THAT fucking dangerous to him. NONE of you, Scott, included, are as \"smart\" as him, ok? Ive read a few things here and he shredded it all so fucking fast I couldnt even begin to answer him or defend shit said here. I will keep trying to get him to post here thru my fb. Anyhow...HE...broke down the whole muslim thing. And Scott and company are DEAD BANG ON regarding that topic. I got the whole break down of everything...keeping in mid that he has of course read four different translation of the Quran, and knows it inside out and upside down. You have to understand the history behind it, not just the book itself and understand Mohammeds background...his influential Christian wife, his father, and the disrespect his people got for being an illiterate nation and godless pagans.\nA truly fucked up religion and that Im sorry is no joke. It simply is what it is. Seriously fucked p man made shit. And boy would my big brain hat me for saying all this to you. But shit when it comes up like this I GOTTA say something, after learnin what Ive learned, and ho I learned it from.\n\nThat tingling had better be my fucking Selsun Blue!\n\nScott...youre a crack dealer. You get people in here, wake them the fuck up, and get them junked out.\nI endorse that shit!",
