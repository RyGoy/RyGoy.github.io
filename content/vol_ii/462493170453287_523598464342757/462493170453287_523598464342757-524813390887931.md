   "message": "I agree with Scott, with all due respect, I suspect your lawsuit will drag on and on for years to come only to be quashed by the \"system/rapists\" once they've taken all your \"money\". I'd much rather see every Canadian tell CRA to go fuck themselves and STOP GIVING them their hard earned \"dollars\". That's what the respective BOOK is about - is it NOT? Ask the questions they CANNOT answer: \"Sure, Mr CRA agent, I'll pay your so-called tax IF - 1. That you provide me with a copy of the statute - the official Act, not a private publishersï¿½ version, since such a book could not be used in a court of law (being copyrighted and such) AND...\n2. That you provide me with The signed BILL which initially enabled the income tax act to OFFICIALLY BECOME LAW... until you can show me a REAL Law - GO FUCK YOURSELF Mr CRA agent! Feel free to use your own words... (you won't...) heheh!",
