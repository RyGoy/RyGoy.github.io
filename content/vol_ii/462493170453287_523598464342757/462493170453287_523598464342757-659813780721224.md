   "message": "I wrote to the Australian branch of the mafia group, asking them what 'income' is because I cannot find a definition anywhere in their Acts...\n\nAfter all, there is no way I can sign a declaration on behalf of the person, indicating what income was earned, if that term is not defined...\n\nNo answers, 5 months and counting...\n\nThey also referred in previous correspondence to 'Your' (My) Tax File Number (Same as SIN)...I asked them if it was a mistake to refer to it as mine, because if it was truly mine, then shouldn't I be allowed to sell it or give it away? (Thanks Admiral for this bit of insight)\n\nSo perhaps they had made a mistake in referring to it as mine...no response to that query either...\n\nFunny that ;-)",
