   "message": "Seriously. I'm so tired of ass-hats joining this group, and NOT following the REQUIRED VIEWING.\n\nYesterday, for example, some Fuck-Tard joined and said this gem:\n\nBruce Botchar: \"what am I talking about, I am talking about having something in your hand that is not imaginary , yes I know money is debt, but silver is not\"\n\nThis reveals a PROFOUND ignorance as to what money IS, and that he hadn't bothered watching the required viewing. Needless to say, he's banned.\n\nTHIS was added to the group description. YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE!\n\n\"This forum is where you can ask all your questions, and we don't have to keep typing the same answers over and over. To that end, I am telling you to WATCH THIS FIRST\"\n\nNO EXCUSES. TAKE THE FUCKING TIME TO WATCH IT,  SO YOU DON'T WASTE ANY MORE OF MY FUCKING TIME!",
