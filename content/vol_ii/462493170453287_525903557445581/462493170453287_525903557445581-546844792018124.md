   "message": "Robert Cormier: Eamonn O Brien: As I understand this REALM of REALITY, if Scott Duncan likes a comment, it is because it contains TRUTH. If I use my powers of reasoning, I am able to therefore deduce, that IRELAND IS A TRUST MANGED BY A CORPORATION KNOWN AS IRELAND. Because (my English teacher is turning in her grave) TRUST LAW Trumps all others, Scott actually spoiled us, saved us from the long story, and lead us directly to the heart of the matter. I suspect (SPOILER ALERT) he is preparing us to be as powerful and AUTONOMOUS as COUNTRIES. We may even be able (if Scott is willing to bestow the power upon us) to be regarded as PERSONS who have DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.",
