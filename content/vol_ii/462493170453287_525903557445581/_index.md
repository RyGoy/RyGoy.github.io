The truth will definitely piss you off first... (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nJames Baal: Adam Thomas, You are Irish right? Can you tell me who in IRELAND is the GRANTOR of the TRUST??? I don't understand ??? GOVERNMENT is OPERATING this TRUST right? But who put it there? My thoughts are going towards EU and some treaty going on there but I simply don't know any idea? Or a direction towards the answer?\n\nAdam Thomas: Ahhhhh.... yep im Irish jim, I was born in aus, lived there a while. Thats a fuckin good question jim bob........EU sounds about right but I'm also thinkin Queenie........\n\nJames Baal: Hmm maybe you right after all, we are sharing the same Bills of Exchange act...\n\nScott Duncan: Remember: 2+2=4\n\nIt's TRUE if I say it.\nIt's TRUE if These two say it\nIt's TRUE if Charles Manson says it.\n\nTRUTH is TRUTH. Who speaks it is irrelevant. TRUTH has NOTHING to do with who says it.\n\nScott Duncan: IRELAND is/was a \"FREE STATE\". Most people do not remember that ALL free states were considered NEUTRAL in World War II.\n\nSince then it has been a \"legal proving ground\" for London. If policy \"works\" in Ireland, they deploy it globally.\n\nJames Baal: RE: Since then it has been a \"legal proving ground\" for London. If policy \"works\" in Ireland, they deploy it globally.\n\nNot sure what that means yet, but I am working on it ;-p\n\nAntonin Mac Phiarais: Ireland is the test case for the banks etc james , scott is 100% correct on this , just look how we took on the debt. now it will be rolled out to all the other nations .. it makes perfect sense to me\n\nJames Baal <----------- ENDORSES \"Scott is 100% correct on everything! Until proven NOT (Which never happens!)\n\nAntonin Mac Phiarais scott , did aquile get standing ???\n\nScott Duncan It works either way\n\nThe right answer is the right answer.\n\nAnton Mac Phiarais: is SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE of it. He knows THE HARD way.\n\nDerek Moran: Maxim-of-Law: \"Power derived, can never be greater than the Power it was derived FROM.\" \n\nAdam Thomas: James Baal. GRANTOR & CREATOR. WHO CREATED THE TRUST!!\n\nScott Duncan: Anton Mac Phiarais Re AQUILAE'S standing: ALL private trusts have standing. It's simply \"Higher Law\". However The House of Windsor Acknowledges it and so does the UK.\n\nChad Brodgesell: Is that why they get MORE freaky when you start addressing PRIVATE matters in a PUBLIC forum? Do not discuss that it is PRIVATE you NUMBNUT, this is ONLY PUBLIC forum! kinda way? i used forum like a court or chambers not the interz net thing. (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nS�il Eile: they tricked us with our own consumption .... freedom! They will give us the colour of our consumption again .. unless we learn.\n\nAdam Thomas: My heart really does bleed for EIRE.My family was involved with tom barry & the flying column in corcaigh when it all started.\n\nAdam Thomas: THE WIND THAT SHOOK THE BARLEY.LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC !!!!\n\nS�il Eile: \"This vid is powerful.\" and a painful fact when letting go of the illusion, spent my entire adult life in the army...... thought i was doing my bit ........ believed!!!\n\nChad Brodgesell I watched it twice and tried to follow the lines of control for power. To many treasonous acts in there and I get all fumble minded half way through.\n\nS�il Eile: oh what a tangled web we weave when at first we set out to decieve.....\n\nAdam Thomas: Yep. I been there too. The swearing allegiance to their queen made me realize that I was a traitor. Really hit home learning about the civil war. Brother against brother. Tragic & still effects me. Have I told any1 that I LOVE to fight poms!! They don't like me when I remind them that their pommie dogs & im iRISH &WE LOVE NOTHING BETTER THAN KICKING POMMIE ASS. They don't want to fight me then. Dunno know why. Got me fucked.\n\nS�il Eile: no oath to queen forme, just protection of her state lol, they didn't want to ruin the illusion for us.they've been emptying this country for 150years, supplying labour to its colony's. US, Canada, australia, NZ & UK. watch your TV on march 17th to see how successful they've been.\n\nAdam Thomas: Killing your own flesh & blood is what tears me apart.\n\nS�il Eile: ha ha... why do they call it \"CIVIL\" War?\n\nAdam Thomas: Because they sold us out to Royallty....piss on them.\n\nS�il Eile: because country men sell themselves for title....\n\nAdam Thomas: NED KELLY WHERE ARE YOU ??\n\nChad Brodgesell: This oath thing is really getting to me. I have never taken an oath (that I know of or can remember), yet it keeps cropping up all the time.\n\nScott Duncan: Look it up in Blacks.\n\nChad Brodgesell: I have, many times, but I just realized something.\nthe word 'signifies'. I could construe that as 'If I made it \"appear' that I have taken an oath. m,,,\n\nChad Brodgesell: screw the word Oath. The action or non denial of or appearing to have an oath is enough 'To have an oath'\n\nS�il Eile: Murdochs irish law dictionary describes an Oath as 1. a solemn declaration by which a party calls his God to witness what he is saying is true 2. includes a solemn affirmation & statutory declaration.... ,,,, nice use of the word include\n\nChad Brodgesell: Blacks fifth\nAny form of atestation by which a person 'signifies' that he is bound in 'conscience' to perform an act faithfully and truthfully\n\nChad Brodgesell: includes a solemn affirmation & statutory declaration.... m, this would mean the prior 'oath' to god is moot leaving only the solemn affirmation &wait for it, \"STATUTORY\" declaration\n\nS�il Eile: lol exactly, to include is to exclude all others, in their eyes it is statutory & thats all there is\n\nChad Brodgesell: the inclusion of one is at the exclusion of all else\n\nS�il Eile: the whole idea of taking them on in court is to challenge those presumptions & fuck them, if theres law i have recourse remedy if theres no law what the fuck am i worried about lol ... lets see\n\nAntonin Mac Phiarais: bait and switch game , get you to swear to god and switch it on you , well ignorance of the law is no excuse is it (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)",
