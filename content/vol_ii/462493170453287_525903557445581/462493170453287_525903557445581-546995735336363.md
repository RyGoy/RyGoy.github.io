   "message": "I read the blog were he finishes the story. \n\nThe case was remanded 2 times after the October 15th \"appearance.\" He insisted in \"showing-up\", first sending a previous \"fee schedule\". \n\nBut, basically what helped him get out of  the surety position was a series of notices/tacit agreements he sent to the \"judge\", and the bailiff. He asked QUESTIONS in his communications (questions negate understanding), and he let know in writing (Law) his wishes of not to contract. He sent all this registered post. \"They\" defaulted. That's what did it, in my opinion.  But his \"appearance\" had NOTHING to do with the outcome, in my opinion.\n\nI think he had the courage to face the music, that has some VALUE, I will not take that away from him.  Yet, apparently, if one chooses to \"appear\", there is NO SPACE FOR A SINGLE ERROR, and/or FLAW. Not because one cannot \"fix\" a MISTAKE afterwards, but because we don't control the circumstances of that place (lots of psychos with guns in there!).\n\nIn this case, he was able to \"fix\" the problem via \"damage control.\" afterwards. And he also DID NOT SHOWED UP to his last hearing. That was good! :) Kudos, Kevin!",
