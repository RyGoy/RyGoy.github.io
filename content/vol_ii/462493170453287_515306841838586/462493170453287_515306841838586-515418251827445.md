   "message": "I lived in Mexico for a while...the Government there is not as well organized as here...(due to incompetence) you pretty much get left alone. Coming back to Canada I had to constantly explain (and train) my kids and Mexican husband on Canadian compliance...I could hear how ridiculous I sounded telling them that we couldn't park in an open spot (during certain hours), that you can't park too close or too far away from the curb, we couldn't just buy and install an above ground pool from Canadian Tire (without permission),...we can't just have glass of wine at the beach...or even on the front steps of our own house!...(don't get me started on the schools)",
