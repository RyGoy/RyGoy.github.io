   "message": "ABS relieves pressure so the wheel's dont lock up, the brake peddle should not be pushing back, you should feel it pulse BUT only if the wheel STOPS ROTATING signifying a lack of traction/grip. next time stomp the pedal HARDER. lock the wheels right up and let the guy behind you plow into you. \n\nin my state, massachusetts, ALL rear end collisions are ALLWAYS automatically the other guys fault for following too close.",
