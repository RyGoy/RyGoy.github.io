   "message": "I like that, nice job! You'll notice though, that I have nothing deposited with the court, and there are no fines (as of yet, lol) this is response to an order...either way, yours is definitely put together better, mine clearly can be better...I am trying to stick with stuff I can (or at least think I can) back up, without having to rifle through notes...If I haven't quite grasped what has been taught yet I don't want to put it down on paper, and then look stupid when I have to answer to it. That's one of the reasons I wanted to run it by Scott, Derek, and everyone, if it has major flaws or \"anal\" origins it will be called out! ha ha thanks Gail Blackman *sigh*...more editing.....",
