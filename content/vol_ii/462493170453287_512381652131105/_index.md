   "message": "ideo on the Fictitious Name, and claiming it.. best described in the audio I did with Juan today.. found on Talkshoe.. Call ID: 122402 May 9th call\n\nVideo shows similarities between the Original Registration of your ownership� compared to what the completed instrument for claiming the name will look like as far as witnesses, and seals..\n\nAlso where it says in the Act for Fictitious Names.. that .. if you are doing business with an assumed name (ALL CAPS)� and have not registered it� you are guilty of a misdemeanor�.. right now.. today� as you sit reading this� you are a criminal� because you have not registered your ownership in your �corporation�\n\nThis is why �unknown owners� is used� The Estate exist.. you at one time were the registered owner.. but did not renew the registration.. and the Estate is considered abandoned�\n\nFurther.. you cannot bring a suit of any kind in the state court unless you have registered your ownership� and you can listen to me read it .. right out of their law�.\n\nSo claim the NAME� before they do�\n\nIts truly profound.. if you just think about it for a minute� by doing this.. you have separated the man from the NAME.. and the STATE is going to Certify it.. you now have a registered corporation.. doing business as ALL CAPS�\n\nAnd in Commerce.. there is only one type of contract.. BILATERAL.. officers of both corporations sign the contract� We did our part.. signed the contract and put up collateral� but the other party has refused to sign the contract� now its just contract law� UCC� Court of Equity (in the Manner of DELEWARE).. lets call it Corporate Equity� no matter�\n\nWhat matters.. is THEY now have a BIG.. BIG .. PROBLEM�..",
