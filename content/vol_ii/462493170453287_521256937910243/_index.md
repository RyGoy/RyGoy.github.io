It is a rule, that every one is prejudiced by his ignorance of law, but NOT by his ignorance of fact.\n\n3). Ignorance of law excuses no one.\n\n4). Ignorance of fact excuses or is ground of relief. Acts done and contracts made under mistake or ignorance of a material fact are voidable and relievable in law and equity\n\n5). IT IS IGNORANCE OF THE LAW WHEN WE DO NOT KNOW OUR OWN RIGHTS.\n\n6). Ignorant of the fact excuses; ignorance of the law excuses NOT. EVERY MAN must be taken to be cognizant of the law; otherwise there is no saying to what extent the excuse of ignorance may not be carried.\n\n7). A MISTAKE in point of law is, in criminal cases, no sort of defense. And, in civil cases, ignorance of the law, with a full knowledge of the facts, furnishes no ground, either in law or equity. To rescind agreements, or reclaim money paid, or set aside solemn acts of the parties.\n\n8). The law assists the ignorant\n\n9). Ignorance, or want of skill, is considered a fault, i.e., a negligence, for which one who profess the skill is responsible.\n\n10). Ignorance of oneï¿½s right does not prejudice the right.",
