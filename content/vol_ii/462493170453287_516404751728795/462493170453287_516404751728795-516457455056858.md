   "message": "Look, here is an analogy to consider.  You pull your car into Mr. Lube where they do oil changes.  You hop out and demand the guy in greasy coverall gives you a haircut.  You tell him that you have every right to receive a haircut (and lets assume you do).  For some reason you are of the belief that Mr. Lube should recognize and honour your right to recieve a haircut.   The guy looks at you like you're nuts.  No matter how loud you yell and scream or try to claim Mr. Lube is a barber shop, you WILL NOT get a haircut there.  They proceed to change the oil in your car though - THAT IS what they do there.  You remain dumb founded as to why they would not give you a hair cut but proceeded to change your oil.  YOU ARE AT THE  WRONG PLACE TO GET A HAIRCUT.",
