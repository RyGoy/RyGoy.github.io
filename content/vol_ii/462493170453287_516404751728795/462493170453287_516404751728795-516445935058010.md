   "message": "My deepest sympathies Dean.  There are no things that impact upon ones right to family, life, liberty and not to be subject to cruel treatment more than keeping a child from a loving and caring human parent.  You speak of the terms \"custody\" and \"access\".  Are those not terms decriptive of statutorily granted privileges conferred upon classes of persons by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second?   You mention \"Family Court\".  Is the jurisdiction of Family Court not almost entirely statutory?  In your other post you state you are \"man with inherent rights and jurisdiction (common law)\".  Why then, are you in a statutory court seeking priviliges conferred upon statutory persons?",
