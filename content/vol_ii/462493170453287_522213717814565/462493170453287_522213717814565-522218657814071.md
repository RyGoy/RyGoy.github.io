   "message": "Yes...all based on hysteria people of your ilk MAKE UP. Check your facts. Virtually NOTHING that's said about Monsanto is actually true!\n\nThey have never ONCE sued ANYONE over \"cross pollination\", and the one guy where the issue even came up was using that as a defence! (His crop was 90% Monsanto seed, so he lost, and started this hysteria)\n\nDo you even BOTHER to check your facts?",
