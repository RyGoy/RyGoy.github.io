   "message": "Scott on how there is NO LEGAL GOVERNMENT in Canada. . . . .\n\nDerek Moran: Dear Government, What exactly is the Birth Certificate you gave me a receipt FOR? (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nScott Duncan: THERE'S NO LEGAL GOVERNMENT and NOBODY'S NOTICED\n\nDerek Moran: *section 15. of the CRIMINAL CODE to Scott Duncan* \"I have!\" (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nDerek Moran: ..think you meant, DE JURE Government?\n\nScott Duncan: Michelle Jean PROROGUED PARLIAMENT\n\nThe House of LORDS PROROGUED MY TITLE\n\nSAME THING!\n\nI don't get the full \"NOBLE TITLE\" and all the goodies until I'm told by The HOUSE OF LORDS or THE HOUSE OF WINDSOR, that it's OK.\n\nTHE GOVERNMENT IS THE SAME! NO GOVERNOR GENERAL HAS REMOVED THIS!\n\nDerek Moran: ..at least Adrienne Clarkson referred to herself as the DE FACTO GovernorGeneral (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nScott Duncan: DE JURE Government? When did we have THAT?\n\nDerek Moran: Did we EVER have a DE JURE Government?\n\nScott Duncan No, we've never had a De Jure Government. ...But if it makes you feel any better, the natives we keep trying to wipe out, did.\n\nScott Duncan: Toss harper out... What would that do? The next Party member in line replaces him. There isn't even an election!\n\nHarper is JUST THE PARTY LEADER. He has no power and \"Harper\" didn't do all this. He's just the mouthpiece in the House Of Commons who speaks for the Party!",
