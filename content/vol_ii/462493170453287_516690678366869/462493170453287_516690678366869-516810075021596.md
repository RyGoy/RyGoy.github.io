   "message": "\"magical super powers\"...sounds fucking awesome and had me laughing...til I got cold and business like. Save that one for yuk yuks. Id suggest to say maybe \"a piece of tin meant to intimidate me\" or some\"unknown item he attempted to attach some \"authority' to (italics? remember, they can, like parentheses, convey sarcasm...without being directly \"sarcastic\". Im sure \"you'll do just FINE\". \nSee?). \nAnd you got it! Man, as I was reading your OP...I could FEEL you were getting more and more pissed off, as Im sure recapping everything in your head got you to heat up as you write. This is like reverse writing block...and just like when that happens, you need to go fuck you wife watch the game or smoke a fat one...and come back at it again later.\nAnd write it as if it aint YOU but someone you wanna help\n\ngood luck",
