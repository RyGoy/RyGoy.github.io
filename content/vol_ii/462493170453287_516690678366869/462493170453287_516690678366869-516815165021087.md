   "message": "yeah, and easy to get pissed when thy step foot on you property.\n\nYou need friends like mine...who will loan you a rottie trained to attack anything with a uniform, badge or gun..let Cujo eat his ass!\n\nIt aint easy, to not get personal, but...remember, the easiest way to WIN or LOSE an argument...is to inject EMOTION into the equation..make THEM get emotional while YOU get cold.\n\nMushashi was the greatest warrior t have ever lived. Youre at war, so follow his rules: A WARRIOR never lets the outside shit affect him internally, nor does he allow whats going on internally (fear, anger, etc) EVER be reflected on the outside. Whether youre about to run, cry, or kill...the veneer remains the same. like an owl...you have no emotion, you see all and calculate all coldly, and with no warning you will swoop down and kill your prey, cuz...thats what you do.",
