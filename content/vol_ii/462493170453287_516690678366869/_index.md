   "message": "well I got a like from Gail to post the revised Notice, it's word for word with names with held, so thank you in advance everyone that helped as you read it I'm sure you will see your contributions, lol...if it is approved...it is quite lengthy\n\nNOTICE\n \nWITH ALL RIGHTS RESERVED, AT ALL TIMES, for the man, Kelleran Holman,\nreferred below as \"I\", \"me\", myself\", \"man\" \n\nre:\"ORDER TO REMEDY \nNON-CONFORMITY WITH STANDARDS \nFOR MAINTANANCE AND OCCUPANCY\"\nReference Number 5-14-2013\nDATED:inspection MAY 14,2013\n\n   To, PROPERTY STANDARDS COMMITTEE, Wxx Mxxx: Property Standards Officer, and all agents of THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX\n\nRegarding your offer of May 16, 2013 (original attached).\n\nRETURNED, NO CONSENT, NO CONTRACT\n\nI am unable to \"COMPLY\" with your \"ORDER\" at this time, as I do NOT understand how I as a MAN, with a COMMON LAW CLAIM OF RIGHT to ALL the property at the location known as 9577 Walker rd Mcgregor, have ANY obligation to, and/or contracts with the CORPORATION OF ESSEX.\nI have read the cited by-laws, and all references are for \"PERSONS\". The defintition section of the by-law and/or codes cited, does NOT properly identify \"PERSON\" as a man, woman, human being, nor does it even mention \"NATURAL PERSON\" for that matter! ANY use of the \"person\" past, present, or future, is PURELY, and ONLY, out of PRIVATE NECESSITY \neg:\nPERSON. 1. The scope of \"person\" as set out in s.2 of the Criminal Code R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 extends somewhat beyond the individual, covering additionally public bodies, corporations, societies and companies, but, groups having common characteristics such as race, religion, colour and ethnic origin ARE NOT included in the definition (R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697)\n\n \"Persons are of two classes only - natural persons and legal persons. A natural person is a human being, that has the capacity for rights or duties. A legal person is anything to which the law gives a legal or fictitious existence and personality, with capacity for rights and duties. The ONLY legal person known to our law is the CORPORATION - the BODY CORPORATE\" (Hague v. Cancer Relief & Research Institute, [1939] 4 D.L.?*blurry* (Man. K.B.)).\n\n   The phone conversation on or about May 10, 2013, with Wxx Mxxx, I was very clear, with regards to \"TRESPASSING\"and \"PRIVATE PROPERTY\" (the signs posted should have also been sufficient notice), and WxxMxxx, arrogantly referred to his BADGE as allowing him to do whatever he wanted, and it appears, trespassed, on TWO occasions. LEGALLY, WxxMxxx may be correct, however, I LIVE  in, and claim COMMON LAW  jurisdiction, with ALL my inherent rights, I do NOT RESIDE in the CORPORATION OF ESSEX, nor am I a \"PERSON\" within the defintion of the \"codes\" or \"by-laws\" you have cited. Therefore I am unclear, and do NOT understand how I or the man known as xxx xxxx, have ANY obligation to the CORPORATION OF ESSEX and/or to it's agents/officers, as we are unaware of any SIGNED contracts that suggest we are.\n\n  Please provide the EVIDENCE you are relying on that I, or the MAN known as xxx xxxx, are in fact obligated to COMPLY  with ANY codes or by-laws of THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, as we are of the understanding that none exist.\n\n What EVIDENCE do YOU have that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a TRUSTEE and/or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN, and/or THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX? What EVIDENCE do you have of any WARRANT OF AGENCY for the PRINCIPAL? What EVIDENCE do you have that there has been any MEETING OF THE MINDS, any PROPER NOTICE GIVEN, any CONSIDERATION OFFERED, or that I have ANY  INTENT TO CONTRACT with the CORPORATION OF ESSEX in this matter? As such, I am returning your offer, DECLINED, for IMMEDIATE discharge and closure. \n\n  NOTICE OF WAIVER OF PUBLIC BENEFITS (ONTARIO CHANGE OF NAME ACT [R.S.O 1990, CHAPTER C.7]\nWHEREAS YOU, being a PUBLIC SERVANT and/or an OFFICER for a PUBLIC TRUST, and/or A GOVERNMENTAL AGENT/OFFICIAL, do NOT have the right, and/or AUTHORITY, to attach SURETY and/or JOINDER, to ANY NAME DERIVED FROM A PUBLIC DOCUMENT, and attach such NAME and/or JOINDER to ME , and\n\nWHEREAS YOU, being a PUBLIC SERVANT and/or an OFFICER for a PUBLIC TRUST, and/or A GOVERNMENTAL AGENT/OFFICIAL, are BOUND BY OATH, I THEREFORE, ACCEPT YOUR OATH OF OFFICE, and respectfully GIVE NOTICE that I, in fact waive ALL benefits of the ONTARIO CHANGE OF NAME ACT [R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER C.7], and as such I MUST DECLINE any such benefits.\n\nIf I, and/or such other parties who act in my interest, have caused YOU to believe that my PRIVATE NAME is derived from ANY PUBLIC DOCUMENT, then that would be a MISTAKE, and please forgive me.\n\nHere are some more points of interest you may want to have a look at before you consider any more attempts at harming me unlawfully.\n\nBY-LAWS are simply put, whether defined in Bouviers, or Blacks law dictionaries as; \"Rules of a corporation for THEIR OWN internal governance.\" ...Therefore, I would have to have consented to, or be employed with, your \"CORPORATION\", to the best of my knowledge, I AM NEITHER.\n\nFEE SCHEDULE: All \"ORDERS\", issued by, or brought forth by, the CORPORATION OF ESSEX, to ME, WILL BE BILLED ACCORDINGLY. I do NOT work for free (involuntary servitude), and it is UNLAWFUL to COMPEL me to. I can, however fairly base the fees, by the numbers found on the lower portion of your \"ORDER\" [meant to intimidate I'm sure] \"not more than $25,000...\", and \"not more than $50,000...\".\n\nTRESPASSING: $25,000 per occurance \nWxx Mxxx was told verbally, via the phone conversation, and presuming Wxx Mxxx can in fact read, could not miss the posted signs on the PRIVATE PROPERTY, That read as follows: PRIVATE PROPERTY/NO TRESPASSING. Wxx Mxxx elected to willfully ignore my verbal warnings, and also chose to ignore the postings, and I must presume, deliberately waited for me to be away from my home to commit the trespass...twice, according to the dates on record. Had Wxx Mxxx been in anyway competant and honourable, I would think he would have made it known, WHEN he would be arriving, so as to avoid any confusion about his magical super badge, and it's apparent supreme power! Clearly Wxx Mxxx has mistaken me, a man, for a person from his ficticious by-law/codes.\n\n  As I have taken the time to take a look through a bit of both the by-law, and the building code act cited, and was unclear how either applied to a real live man, and further, looking to the definition section for clarification, and still found no evidence to that effect, I am not surprised that Wxx Mxxx opted to disregard my wishes, to first provide some first hand knowledge, and/or facts, that I should be compelled to do anything, as I requested from the start. Rather, Wxx Mxxx thought that his magical super badge exempted him from any sort of due process liability, and said as much to me on the phone, his actions of trespass, without first providing me with said evidence, is clear verification, that he is either completely incompetant, and truly has no clue, HOW the by-law/code applies to me, without my CONSENT, and has never bothered to actually read, and/or understand the definition section of the by-law/codes he enforces, and thinks that his imaginary authority, and his magical super badge, really does offer Wxx Mxxx immunity from being even personally liable for his actions, and trespasses! Or he was just to lazy to provide the binding contract, or evidence I required, that would compel me to go along with his \"order\", thus causing THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, a certain amount of liability on his behalf.\n \nWhatever the reason, in the spirit of being honourable I will allow Wxx Mxxx, and/or ANYONE from THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, that can provide a better answer than \"because I have a badge\" magical and super as it must be (the local police force doesn't even spew that kind of nonesense!), 14 days from receipt of this NOTICE, to rebut everything I have claimed, understand, etcetera, under penalty of perjury, and full commercial liability.\n\nNOTICE:\n\"TORT- a BY-LAW-OFFICER is guilty of a Tort, if the By-Law-Officer violates an Anglo-Saxon-Jute Common Law and/or Natural Law Inherited rights. A By-Law-Officer who is CONSIDERED to be a Tortfeasor is liable to a fine of not more than $50,000 for the first Tortious act and to a fine of not more than $100,000 for a subsequent Tortious act\" subsection #becauseifuckingsaidso..sound familiar, but, somehow different the way I say it, right?\n\nOr you can kindly send me an apology letter, and I in turn will forgive Wxx Mxxx for his misguided blind faith in his magical super badge.\n\nCLAIM OF RIGHT: NOTICE! ALL PROPERTY at the location known as 9577 Walker Road, Mcgregor is held under A COMMON LAW CLAIM OF RIGHT.\n\nFrom the Criminal Code:\n 39. Defence with claim of right\n39. (1) Every one who is in peaceable possession of personal property under a claim of right, and every one acting under his authority, is protected from criminal responsibility for defending that possession, even against a person entitled by law to possession of it, if he uses no more force than is necessary.\n\nSo, to conclude, your options are relatively simple, and are as follows:\n\n 1)Provide the dually signed contract I or the man Known as xxx xxx has with the CORPORATION OF ESSEX, and,\n\n2)Provide verified signed complaint by an injured and/or damaged human being, an affirmation, that they have in fact been injured and/or damaged, and,\n\n3)Provide proof, and/or first hand knowledge that I, and/or the man known as xxx xxx have been given full disclosure to the terms of the relationship with, THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, and have thus given consent to be governed by, THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, and,\n\n4)Ignore due process entirely, Roll the dice, and come and harm an otherwise peaceful man, with threats of trespass and seizure, with hopes that the magical super badge is in fact all powerful, and will offer immunity at the queens bench if need be, as I consider Wxx Mxxxs' actions a willful attack on my rights, and a human rights violation in general, I could not in good conscience waive my rights, to satisfy an office/corporation, that I have NO known relation with, regardless of the inconvenience it may cause me, or,\n\n5)Send an apology letter.\n\n  I would like to also mention, due in part to Wxx Mxxx informing me that I, \"did not know what I was talking about\", I would venture, that as far as the \"club rules\" of the CORPORATION OF ESSEX is concerned, since I am not a member, nor an employee (kind of like I am not a member or employee of walmart either), therefore I have no great amount of knowledge of said club rules, as I understand I have no need to know them, but,\n\nThe saying goes \"ignorance of the LAW is no excuse\" ,I don't recall it being ingnorance of the by-law/code is no excuse, or,\n\"All are equal before the law\", is also quite popular, but I can't for the life of me, find, \"the magical super badge nulifies all equality before the law\" clause...please forward the reference to that one, along with how orders from THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX imply people are charities...maybe they should get in touch with UNICEF if they expect things/\"orders\" done for free. \n\nAgain, the office/agents of the PROPERTY STANDARDS COMMITTEE, THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, AND/OR Wxx Mxxx  have 14 days to respond, and/or rebut in writing, with FACTS, to the above notice, claims, and understanding, under penalty of perjury, and full commercial liability, or use the apology letter, I'm flexible like that.\n\n All rights reserved for Kelleran Holman\n\nwitnessed by:\n\nwitnessed by:\n~end\nfeel free to bash it, like it and/or add crucial points, or suggest removing unnecessary points of interest...I'm off to bed, my eyes are bugging out...and I squint ;)",
