   "message": "The \"good faith\" angle is a good one. The format and tone...notsomuch. ME, I would avoid ad hominem comments, snides, and otherwise rude comments, and stick to the  facts. \"Hi how are you\"?  This'm isntba letter to too your pen pal.or grand ma. Thisnis business, but your letter sounds too....\"PERSONal\". Cold, analytical, to the point, and seboid of \"poetic devices\"...cool quips and sarcasm  dont do shit to help you, discredit your respect, and sends thr message that youre a shit disturber (which is fine, you just dont let them know to what extent in a LETTER)",
