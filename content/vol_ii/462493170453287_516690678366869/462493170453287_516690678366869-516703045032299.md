   "message": "The whole point of \"Hi - how are you?\" i know, as lame as that sounds; is to NEGATE controversy from the get-go. They thrive on controversy, they LOVE controversy, they wanna be able to drag you in front of a court and be able to point at something in which YOU created the controversy to be there to begin with in the first place. Controversy is fucking OXYGEN to these people. To each his own, though.",
