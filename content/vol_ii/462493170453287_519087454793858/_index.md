   "message": "So, im sure plenty of folks are wanting to know what the hell was done. Its easy. We established a contract with a chq. See, i was getting frustrated with these companies who dont wanna acknowledge the remittance vouchers they keep stealing. So, i thought well how else can we can evidence of a contract. Hmmmm, ding, Chq, gets cashed a digital copy gets placed on your bank statement. So, writing a chq out to a company who says you owe xxx amount. The trick is holding the contract once its there. So once it was cashed a Notice of contract memorandum was drawn up by myself for my client. So, sent it right off and it was to acknowledge the agreement that was just established. So, 20days later she gets her update and its a zero balance as agreed. So, this might be a good win now. However, companies dont like to loose, so they will attempt to move the contract and try to get you to agree there is still an outstanding balance of 1000 even those your 20 dollar chq said it was to settle the account to zero.\n\nSo, what to do ? well, most get quite upset and angry and curse and say fuck, it didnt work.... :(  , well im saying they are merely attempting to move the contract with a new offer. So what to do with that ? well, accept it fully on the condition that, ....the contract already agreed upon, doesnt already settle the account and it would appears as fraud if they wished to purse the alleged debt any further after we came to an agreement right ? Well, this is why its soooooooo important to know contract law and read the damn books. Fucking READ THE BOOKS , PDF AND ASK QUESTIONS.......dont be lazy and forgive me, if those of you who have read the damn books. Order your books at   you can get plenty of cheap cheap contract law books ",
