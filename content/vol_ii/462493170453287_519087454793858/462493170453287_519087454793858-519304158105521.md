   "message": "ah HA! remittance voucher! i recieved a paper from the town tax collector. it says COPY and please send 'remittance' to. the tax is 'excise' which is a commercial use of the public roads which i dont do, i told them i dont but there is a trick on the registry paperwork for the place of 'principally garaged'. i allredy tried to have that removed from the record as a mistake (which ofcourse they wont do), so now i have to fight them on this alleged tax. (suppose i ought to photocopy the document to show it to you).\nI'm thinking to say upon proof of claim that I do infact commercially use the public roads... what say you?",
