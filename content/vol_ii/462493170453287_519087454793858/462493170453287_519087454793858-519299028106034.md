   "message": "OK�.I am trying something with Hydro-Quebec, I have started this only because after reading stuff, it made sense to me to do it.\nI Stopped paying for these REMITTANCE VOUCHERS I receive from HQ 10 months ago.\nIn last December, they�ve sent me a threatening NOTICE saying that they will disconnect my line if I don�t pay them. \nSo, I decided that I was going to send them something�the amount I�m supposly OWING to them was, at that time $1300.00.\nSo, here is, The English version of what I�ve sent them in French \nHydro-Quebec\nServices de Recouvrement\nCP 176 Succ D�Youville\nMontreal (Quebec)\nH2P 2V4\n\nObjet :  Num�ro de Client 103XXXXXX\n Num�ro de Compte : 2990XXXXXXXX\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nDear Mister / Madame,\n\nThis lette ris to respond to your letter on dec. 2013 sent to me.\n\nAccording to you, I have a total amount to pay of $1295.04 which is past due, and, as your notice stated, there is DANGER that you will cut the electricity if this amount is not paid.\n\nMy intentions are to pay ALL debts that has been contracted by me and/or my Person, so, if indeed I have a debt with you, I want to pay.\n\nHowever, at this moment, I don�t have $1295.04 in Bank Notes, and I have to admit that I have no idea on when I will have this amount in fiduciary money, so, because of the fact that electricity is a necessary need for me and my family, , Well I am SCARED�your notice scares me big time.\n\nSo, I am asking you, if OTHER method of payment and/or remittance might exist, other than fiduciary money to settle this matter, or maybe an EXCHANGE service could do ?.\n\nI am ready to consider any other payment and/or remittance method, but, as far as fiduciary money, I don�t have access to it for the moment.\n\nIf you need someone to cut your grass, and/or, wash your window, I will gladly accept this duty to stay in honor, if of course, I really owe you.\n\nThanks in advance for your prompt reply\n\nAvec Respect, Honneur, Dignit� et Int�grit�\n\n________________________________\nPierre Daoust\n\nSo far, this first letter had for effect that they removed me from the collection department, but they still sending these remittance vouchers, I�m at $2700.00 as we speak with them, they never answered my letter, I just re-sended it 3 days ago, and insist for an answer�.\n\n:D (Please keep in mind that I have not seen anyone experimenting this shit before...)",
