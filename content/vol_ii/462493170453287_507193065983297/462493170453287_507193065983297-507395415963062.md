   "message": "at the risk of sounding like an idiot [me] the party needs to quote a pre 1933 case law [or is that pre 1871] resolution, inorder to cause the court to be able to recognize common law jurisdiction. he needs to get someone with a repair plate to get his vehicle released before it costs more than it's worth, and for the same reason, because the towman isnt liable and the bill is daily storage, and that fight is a different complaint alltogether.\n\nI think that because he was even speaking with the judge itself was acknowledgement of the jurisdiction. he failed to set the stage properly by beginning with (and i think this was one of Scott's firmly made points): for the record I reserve All rights and if the court has any objection, towhich the court can not reply thus having reserved ALL rights places the party as administrator eliminating any presumption of him being trustee. \n\nthe whole point being you cant play there game and expect to fight them, they can rewrite the script at will. unless you are prepared as scott has specified, incorporate, trust, lien the fuck out of the security interest (birth certificate), your in their system until they provide you a way out by such things we have discussed as being called beligerent.\n\ncontempt! civil/criminal? criminal, produce the victim? civil, produce the contract?",
