   "message": "There is a magic code you must enter into a time machine located in the basement of the Federal Reserve Bank ATM machine. That machine will dispense you a Magic Ring that will take you to the Mountain of Gulfor where if you stand with one leg on a purple rock while holding your cock in your left hand, you will see a hologram of a dollar amount floating before you. Grab it with a fishnet made of scarlet linen and present it to the King along with your \"birth bond\" and trumpets will play as the guardsmen bring out your \"Eleventy Billion\" dollars in golden wheelbarrows ;)",
