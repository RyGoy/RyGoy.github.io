   "message": "Correct Dwaine, the terminology just varies in different countries. But the aim is always the same. As for estates of the dead, this is why one never engages a lawyer to 'represent' them. It all comes down to 'the dead cannot speak' so a representative is needed to do so. As for above, the trick seems to be to challenge any prosecutor BEFORE the judge speaks. The role of the judge is one of process only and he has to ensure due process is followed, thats it. Challenging a prosecutor to supply 'full disclosure' sends them reeling because the truth is they can never do this without exposing the true nature of 'the game'.",
