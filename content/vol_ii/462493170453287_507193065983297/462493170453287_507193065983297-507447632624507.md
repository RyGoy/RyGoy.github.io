   "message": "You CANNOT \"claim\" common law jurisdiction in a statutory court.  A statutory court ONLY has jurisdiction (authority) to hear statutory matters - THATS IT.  Can you go to Wendy's and \"claim\" they MUST provide you with a Big Mac???   Wendy's has NOT been granted authority (jurisdiction) to make a Big Mac for you.  If you want a Big Mac go to McDonalds (a court that has common law juridiction).",
