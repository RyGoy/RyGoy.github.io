   "message": "Scott on setting-up a CORPORATION/TRUST-thread.....\n\nScott Duncan It's REALLY not as as hard as you make out.\n\n1: Establish a trust\n2: Establish a corporation - In the Charter, assign the role of the corporation to HOLD the trust, and establish the \"Law\" guidelines (You get to make your own up) as regards keeping the trust.\n3: Get ANY accountant to manage the books of the corporation. You direct the corporation as FIRST DIRECTOR, and establish roles (President/CEO Vice President, etc) which is how the UNITED STATES was formed.\n\nSide Note: EVER NOTICE that when the US \"Liberates\" a country, they NEVER install their form of government? It's always a PARLIAMENT they install. Figure out why that is, and things will be clearer. USE THE U.S. AS A MODEL FOR YOUR CORPORATION.\n\nThe accountant EXECUTES YOUR TASKS within the framework. To establish a trust, write it down, and have it witnessed and notarized. The end. Only shareholders of your corporation are recognized by the trust.\n\nThese are just pretend names. Officially Mine is AQUILAE trust.\n\nStop letting OTHERS define YOUR trust/claim. Call it Le Trust Du Pierre, for all I care. IT'S YOURS and your CORPORATION'S.\n\nUsing GOVERNMENT terms is an INVITATION FOR STANDING.\n\nWell, if you really NEED me to draw up a Trust declaration I could be hired to do it.\n\nI don't accept MONEY as payment for my skill. It's illegal, and unlawful (I receive benefit while ignoring the legal framework it offers), but I do have many other payment options!\n\nYou can pay money to Roguesupport Inc (in trust).\nYou can pay me directly!\n\nI accept:\n1: Severed body parts from Cops/lawyers/judges.\n2: The bound and gagged (But Not raped! I don't do sloppy seconds) wife/daughter/mother, of a SENIOR Judge/Lawyer/Cop delivered to a venue of my choosing (PREMIUM service for this payment)\n3: Various technologies (Changes constantly. CONFIRM hardware before attempting to retain me)\n4: The corpse of any Judge/Lawyer/Cop who has harmed me previously\n\nI also require payment up front.\n\nOr you may present your draft 22 years hence",
