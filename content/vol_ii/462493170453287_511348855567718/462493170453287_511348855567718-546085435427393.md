   "message": "Stuart Stone: Yeah it was late & I had a wee bout of talking out my ass backwards, thanks Joseph Pierre Gilles Hope I didn't lead anyone too far astray...corporate entity is seen as a different 'person' in law...your private trust agreement is exactly that, private. The only public notice you need to make is one that states that the name has been liened into a private trust...(I'm not sure exactly what the notice needs to say because I'm still researching that part...ie: Do I need to name the private trust and or corporation etc?)\n\nMaybe the oracle Scott Duncan would be so kind as to fill in a few of the gaps.\n\nA good place to learn from (if you're in Canada) is http://www.ppsa.ca/ppsaca/ re lien registration etc...there are posts on different threads on TENDER FOR LAW that go into the Canadian system & ppsa in more detail, you just need to take the time to go through them. I'm currently trying to decipher & find the equivalent for Australia...",
