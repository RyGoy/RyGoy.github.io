   "message": "Beverly Girl-Brain Braaksma, the 'monetary value' is a beginning point for which a Security in the name of your LEGAL PERSON, may be sold to a private investor. Each time an amount is 'borrowed' from the account into which was deposited the proceeds from the sale of the aforementioned Security, the 'monetary value' of the account is increased 'dollar for dollar'.\n\nAs the 'borrowed' amount will never be repaid, a Note is deposited into the account, in the 'borrowed' amount, and becomes an asset to the account. Each time an amount is 'borrowed' by any agency or faction of the LEGAL SOCIETY, a Promissory Note is deposited and the 'monetary value' of the LEGAL PERSON increases. This has NO affect on the Living man, other than when acting as agent for the LEGAL PERSON, the Living man may draw against the assets of the account for the discharge of debts established by the LEGAL PERSON.\n\nAny other use constitutes FRAUD.",
