   "message": "Some notes from Scott Duncan....\n\n1: Establish a trust\n\n2: Establish a corporation - In the Charter, assign the role of the corporation to HOLD the trust, and establish the \"Law\" guidelines (You get to make your own up) as regards keeping the trust.\n\n3: Get ANY accountant to manage the books of the corporation. You direct the corporation as FIRST DIRECTOR, and establish roles (President/CEO Vice President, etc) which is how the UNITED STATES was formed. \n\nSide Note: EVER NOTICE that when the US \"Liberates\" a country, they NEVER install their form of government? It's always a PARLIAMENT they install. Figure out why that is, and things will be clearer. USE THE U.S. AS A MODEL FOR YOUR CORPORATION.",
