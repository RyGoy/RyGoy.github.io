   "message": "Ethan John Muellers: Okay, I would like to lay down the process as I understand it to be so I can be told I am a idiot if I am incorrect about anything.\n\nFirst off I will need to register a CORPORATION that I am the SOLE SHAREHOLDER and DIRECTOR of. I then will have make the CORPORATION a ASSET of a PRIVATE TRUST that I just happen to be the ADMINISTRATOR , INHERITOR and BENEFICIARY of. Then as the DIRECTOR and SOLE SHAREHOLDER of the CORPORATION I will direct the CORPORATION to lien the NAME that I am the LAWFUL holder of in due course. From that point the name that I am the LAWFUL holder of in due course will be deemed property of the CORPORATION and therefore property of the TRUST.\n\nAm I mixing any of this up, or missing anything crucial?",
