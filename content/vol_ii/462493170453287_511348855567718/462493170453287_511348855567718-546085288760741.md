   "message": "Ethan John Muellers: Stuart, when you say Place the trust inside a corporation (separate person in law). do you mean another human being? or a corporate entity? if so would it have to be someone else's \"person\" or could I use my own? who would I send my private trust agreement to? my guess would be the attorney general and maybe the head of calgarys local police force off the top of my head.\n\nI just recently sent a registered letter to the attorney general stating that I am the sole administrator/beneficiary of ETHAN JOHN MUELLERS and I also had a fee schedule attached. Would this be considered a CORPORATE CHARTER? if not what would?",
