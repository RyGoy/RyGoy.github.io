One of Scott Duncan's rules of law is that if it is difficult, then you're doing it wrong...As I understand it, Trust law is the highest form of law.\n\nYour private trust agreement has equal standing in law with any other trust. You can lien the NAME into the private trust, making it trust property. The government has no right to challenge that action because the government is not a 'person' and cannot be a party to the action.\n\nThe private trust can not be challenged by anyone unless they are a settlor, trustee or beneficiary...for anyone else, they are not a party & therefore it is none of their business.\n\nPlace the trust inside a corporation (separate person in law), and make sure you are the controlling shareholder in the corporation and the Director. The corporation can then extract value from or on behalf of the person, under the direction of the Director (You), for the benefit of the shareholder (You), and the name is now out of commerce because it is the property of a private trust.\n\nAlso, like you said, your corporate charter creates your private law/jurisdiction.",
