   "message": "Q 1) Which choice, Domestic profit? \nhttp://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/corpweb/corcor.htm\n\nI understand someone else besides myself has to be named within the options?\nWhat is the possible pitfalls of that if it is so? Should that party be the accountant? (you said hire an accountant), or just someone you trust to get the paperwork to you?\nI presume this is the party who you would call to provide the notices and proof of lien to the court to over rule a warrant...\n\nCan the corporation be the same as the name on the birth certificate? why/whynot\n(refferencing the party in FL who put a hold on the name making it a fiction)\nCan this situation be offered to others as a benefit? \nCan it be a source of collateral to the company?\n\nQ 2) How is the corporation supposed to open a bank account without a drivers license ID? they want one and gave me a hard time just to close a business account, so i went to a different branch and had no problem. but they still wouldnt answer the question i asked them when i told them i had to do a corp & lien, i presume if the corporation holds any funds it needs to be on deposit somewhere.\n\nif I lien my Bcert. and claim it's worth say 3M$ can the company then 'borrow' against that from a bank?",
