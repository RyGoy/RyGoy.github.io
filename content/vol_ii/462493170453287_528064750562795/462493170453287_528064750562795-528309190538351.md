   "message": "G'day Adam Thomas, I've been checking the Aussie clubhouse rules...BofE Act refers us to the relevant state legislation re duty.\n\nNSW & Victoria Duties Acts want an 'impressed stamp', NSW has abolished adhesive stamps & Vic only accepts them as duty on certain instruments...\n\nNSW wants $1.15 for every $100 of consideration (up to $14000) & Victoria wants 60cents per $100.00.\n\nI may have missed the reference to 5 cents per Bill of Exchange (which is the case for New Zealand), so if you have it, please PM me.  In the meantime, I'm awaiting a reply from the Vic & NSW Dept of State Revenue for specific instructions...so I can demonstrate that I'm acting in good faith ;-)",
