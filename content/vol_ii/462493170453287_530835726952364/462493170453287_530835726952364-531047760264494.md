   "message": "Computer Science. That's how. You're a sophisticated meatware data-collection mechanism that has evolved advanced management of the data it gathers.\n\nSelf-Awareness is what allows animals with no fur, horns, armour, scales, antlers, etc., to protect us, to survive in a world that is trying to kill them. Your self-awareness, allows you to exist and alter nature around you.\n\nAt the moment I can work with A.I.s that are about as smart and self-aware as a cockroach. It's just a PHYSICAL restriction. More processing power would allow me to do more, but I don't have enough time in my life to do what I want with AI, but I can say that self-aware machines are a certainty. It's just a matter of time.\n\nBIOLOGICAL intelligence may just be a fleeting phase of intelligence in the universe.\n\nComputer Science is the answer to those questions, Cara Small Atherton.\n\n...because it's the answer to EVERYTHING.",
