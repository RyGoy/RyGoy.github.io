   "message": "3 years ago, you had never heard of a 3d printer, now you can get one for under $2000.\n\nTrust me when I say, you will be able to \"print\" genome \"patches\" with off-the-shelf equipment. You just need the knowledge/skill. We can ALMOST do that NOW.\n\nAll you need to do is keep up. That's what I'm doing now. You have to CATCH up... which is NOT easy, and is getting harder every day.\n\n...it's easier to think \"jesus did it\". That's the problem, because as I said, we have learned more in the past 10 years than we have in the past 2000 years, and every day you think \"Jesus did it\", is a day 300 new things are discovered, and we move ever farther apart in the whole \"Knowledge Gap\".\n\nEventually I'll need to be \"employed\" by the commercial science industry, because the rest of you would be too stupid to provide any value.\n\n...but I truly tried to wake people up in time. It's too late. Tara Duncan lives her life on an intellectual stair-master that never stops...and that's just so she can keep up. She has access to me 24/7.\n\n...what chance do any of you have?\n\nIt won't be \"repo men\". It will be a transfer of ownership. You will be \"owned\" by somebody like me.\n\nSomeone like me who studies REALITY and not imaginary sky-daddies TODAY, will decide if you live or die, tomorrow.",
