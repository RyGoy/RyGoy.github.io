   "message": "We've all heard the term, \"With great power comes great responsibility\".\n\nI don't know if you equate that with one, or all, of the concepts of political power, financial power, or the power derived from possessing knowledge.  Suffice it to say there's an unwritten rule that people who possess any of these things should return something back to the community.\n\nScott, and to a lesser extent, the people who work for and with him, are attempting to do just that.\n\nI'm not clear regarding what value people give to freely offered information.  I will tell you that in making this knowledge available, day-in and day-out, it has taken a great toll on Scott's resources, and his time.\n\nI read a recent comment that said, paraphrased, \"if you are willing to wade through the crap and debris of other people's useless comments, there is real value to be had in these pages\".  Why did this comment even have to be made?  Why do you feel it necessary to insert useless comments and suggestions into a thread until it is barely recognisable for the purpose for which it is intended?  \n\nI am asking you politely to please stop polluting the thread with your unrelated personal comments, witticisms, date-night crap, and whatever other written debris you find so compelling. \n\nTHE TENDER FOR LAW is about law and finance.  It is not an advice forum; it is a place where people can come to freely share information and ideas.\n\nI don't want to start censoring comments; but I implore you to try to focus on the subjects at hand.\n\nThis is not a dating site.  There is no room for discussions about your imaginary friends. This is not the place for petty bickering, posturing, or jokes about your reproductive organs.  \n\nPlease read everything there is to offer before you post a comment.  While there may be the occasional overlap of questions, I'm tired of seeing the same bullshit comments and questions that have been ignored, addressed, asked and answered, again, and again, and again.\n\nWe are running out of time.  Please don't waste any more of it. While this may mean nothing to you, it is agonizingly clear to me.",
