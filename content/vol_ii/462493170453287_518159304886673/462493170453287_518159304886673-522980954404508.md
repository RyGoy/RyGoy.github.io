   "message": "This also ties in with what annoys me national pride. So you're proud to be Irish or Canadian or whatever seriously what part of that did you have anything to do with. I'm from earth man made Ireland how can i be proud of something i didn't achieve? People go to war to see who's country is better and who's imaginary friend is better. National pride is second to religion by a long shot but it's pretty high up in the stupid belief structures programmed into us. Ireland is the name of the wing of our prison and that is nothing to be proud of. Just like skin pigment doesn't make you a different race we are all one species anything to the contrary is only there to divide",
