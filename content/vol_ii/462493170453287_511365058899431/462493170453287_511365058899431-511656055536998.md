   "message": "*lightbulb-goes-off*  \"When a contract has been fundamentally breached, you can set the terms of remedy.\"...... interesting. Using that same logic, lets take the City of Toronto's Charter of Expectations, basically a run-down of THEM stating how they will act as our public-servants and treat the rest of us. HOWEVER, if they are in BREACH of their OWN Charter, then, WE too can set our own terms for the REMEDY?? :/\n\nhttp://www.toronto.ca/employment/life_tps/values.htm",
