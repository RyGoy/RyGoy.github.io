   "message": "Yes. I must provide NEW valid hashes to a key server on the NX Network. If I stop, the network replicates a \"set up\" of automated servers (turnkeylinux.org LAMP Stack) which will publish a bunch of collected documentation on themselves, and then to Facebook, Google+ etc, through HUNDREDS of IDs that were set up over 6 years ago. I get daily reports in exchange for a fresh hash key. It's a good trade. All I have to do is STOP asking for reports :D",
