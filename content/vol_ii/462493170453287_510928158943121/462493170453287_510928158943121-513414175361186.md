And then a WHOLE PILE of Clubhouse bullshit.\n\nThere was some White-Trash guy who is supposed to be the REAL \"clubhouse leader\", and all the while ignoring the fact that (To quote Scott Duncan) YOU'RE NOT IN THE FUCKING CLUB.\n\nScott's right. You people LOVE your bullshit! Even bullshit that floats on other bullshit! IT doesn't seem to matter. As long as it's bullshit, you people just LOVE it!",
