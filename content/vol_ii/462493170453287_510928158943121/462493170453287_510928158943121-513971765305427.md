   "message": "James Allan: You seem to be under the mistaken impression that POLICE and COURTS are THE SAME THING, and they aren't.\n\nYou are correct. A cop can barely read and can't form an original thought. They may arrest you. But after they turn you over to \"the system\" their job is DONE. Don't want that? Kill them when they try to arrest you, or AVOID THEM.\n\nFUN FACT: A POLICE OFFICER is NEVER a \"witness\" in court! They are merely INFORMANTS. True story!",
