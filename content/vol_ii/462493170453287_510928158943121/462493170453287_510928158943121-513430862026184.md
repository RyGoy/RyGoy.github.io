   "message": "Sigh...  Here is the problem.  Fact one, if \"they\" want to arrest your ass and put you in a cage they are going to do so if \"they\" deem you as having violated an Act or Reg.  Fact two, \"they\" will not give a flying fuck if you do not acknowledge their Acts and Regs (but you can likely discuss it with your cell mate who is addicted to percs and needs his methodone and he will agree with you whole heartedly, but not likely be able to pull any strings to get you out) .  Fact Three, if you do not know how to navigate yourself within \"their\" system you may be in that cage for a long time.  It does not matter if they are right or wrong - understand that well.  When the cop slaps the cuffs on you and hauls your ass to jail you better know your stuff - within \"their\" system.  For anyone who doubts what I have stated, go to the front lines and get yourself arrested for doing something that harms no one, is not a fraudulent contract, and fucks with no ones shit.",
