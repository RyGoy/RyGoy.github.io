   "message": "SCOTT...I AM, not the one, who posted the LEGAL DEFINITION, from a LEGAL DICTIONARY, citing a definition for NATURAL LAW. You gave a SUCCINCT, SHORT, CONCISE, and TO-THE-POINT answer in the difference between THEIR common law, and what you termed ACTUAL common law. I just asked basically you to do the same for what YOUR definition would be, the same as you did for ACTUAL common law, for the term NATURAL LAW?  *SHEESH*",
