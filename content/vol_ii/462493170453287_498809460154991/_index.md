   "message": "So Scott, if one has an incorporated business, to protect that name, and a much needed BN number (for import purposes), how do you protect that? Have the business name owned by a private trust? Then could you keep your registered name/BN? I thought to let them know I don't need the BN anymore but I am still importing though it... How do you keep the business name \"taken\" within Canada without implying joinder?",
