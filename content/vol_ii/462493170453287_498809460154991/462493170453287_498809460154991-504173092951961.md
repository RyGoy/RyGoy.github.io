   "message": "So starting from scratch...\n\nI apply to Incorporate a business. I and a friend, for instance, are the appointed shareholders. We outline that the business is one that supplies entertainment for events. \"GOOD TIMES INC\"\n\n We appoint ourselves as directors and appoint a talented young chap as a performer and agent of the corporation... \n\nWe prepare our articles of incorporation and send them off. We then receive the certificate of incorporation. \n\nThe name \"GOOD TIMES INC\" is now a PERSON in law. \n\nAs possessor of the person EAMONN O BRIEN I then give it to \"GOOD TIMES INC\" for dispositioning/transferring ownership. \"GOOD TIMES INC\" then lien that PERSON and place it in a TRUST  within the corporation...\n\nAm I understanding it so far? :p",
