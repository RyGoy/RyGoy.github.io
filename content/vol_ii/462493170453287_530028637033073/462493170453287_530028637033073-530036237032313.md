   "message": "Science is MISNAMED. It should be called \"REALITY\".\n\nWe comprehend reality and document it, and that is Science in a nutshell.\n\nYou don't get to Science-bash, while using a computer. :P\n\nThe METHOD is what makes science WORK. You are using a processor that has more switches than there are stars in the galaxy. Think about that. THAT is what Science does. When you use the SCIENTIFIC METHOD you ALWAYS arrive at the right answer eventually.\n\nhttp://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/overview_scientific_method2.gif",
