   "message": "i have a theory, the space shuttle exploded in 1986 and i bought a silver ounce commemorative today that says that, for a twenty dollar debt note. my theory is that the guy i got it from probably paid only fifteen for it earlier today (he said it came in thismorning). so he probably made in theory 5bucks and i'm happy because it dillutes the 34 dollar ounce i bought last year by 7. (ofcourse i bought a lot more than that last year, but you guys cant probably do that kind of math... (LOL)",
