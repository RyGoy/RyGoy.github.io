   "message": "When watching that link, my mind immediately jumped from the religious perspective being presented to the excessive penalties from government for victimless 'crimes', or one man made construct (government) believing it has the right (apart from superior firepower and force) to judge/condemn and/or impose its will over me when I have done no harm.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the world is made up of a bunch of different opinions, often similarly aligned, sometimes not & occasionally violently opposite to each other...as long as they are logically constructed & based on a reasonable premise then they represent a valid standpoint...ad hominem attacks/comments for me just demonstrate a lack of reasoning capability to express a point, but then again that's just an opinion too. \n\nThanks for posting the original link, I enjoyed it ;-)",
