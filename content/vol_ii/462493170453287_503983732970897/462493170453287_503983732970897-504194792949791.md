   "message": "Really?!?  I was referring more to the points regarding parallels of flawed logic/initial premise to arrive at a position, how blind faith & belief without validation is harmful (in this case they use a deity argument) & the question of how can I be 'free'/fully in 'heaven' if my brother is 'asleep'/'in hell'...which is in my opinion, kind of why this group exists- to wake more people up...I watched the above following the original link & found that, for me it flowed on quite well, hence the share...guess I'm just too close minded then hey?!? ;-)",
