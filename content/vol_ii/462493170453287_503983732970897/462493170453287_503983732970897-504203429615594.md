   "message": "Naw, not at all, it's just that sometimes examples get TOO much focus and the original point lost from side tracking when the example becomes \"preaching� about sonethibg else...so yes its useful in the sense that it discusses things like flawed logic and blind faith, but, in my opinion, turned a bit into a sub topic about that ONE example. Maybe if it used a few ...politics, education,  nutrition, etc. It woukd hsve had more appesl to me and an attack on flawed reaskning, and not so much religion perr se.\n\nHad it dwelled on �government\" and not �religion� (which it could have) I probably would have thought it more relevant I guess, but still would question it as being a eloquent and well presented rant, but a rant nonetheless. Variety of examples always wins the day, and exemplifies the real main thought, wich often gets lost when the example is in itself a huge topic of potential discussion.\n\nNice how we can hold different povs and avoid ad hominen comments, isnt it? \nLol",
