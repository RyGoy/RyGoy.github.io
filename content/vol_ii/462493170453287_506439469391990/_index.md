   "message": "Hi folks, I have a question for whom ever can answer. \nA County Council was awarded nearly �8k by a Circuit Court Judge against a woman (she was not present in the Court and had no Legal Rep. their for her), I wrote to the Law Firm after the County Council was awarded the Cash and demanded that they provide factual evidence and gave 10 working days.\nNow, 3 months later have got back to us and have sent a Notice of Discontinuance for the claim, so I take it they abandoned their claim, right?\nBut, they are now saying that they are going to start fresh legal proceedings, if the �8k is not paid in 7 days, what will we do??",
