   "message": "Ok.....\"income\"..was what I said...UN context if what I was getting at. If you're even \"reporting\", you're subscribing to THEIR  game..it makes your earnings become \"income\" from your \"employment\" and not earnings from your independently contracted trade work. So if you're \"filing\" it's \"income\" you're REPORTING....\n\nSo ...when I said \"IF any\"...it stands to reason that it would be \"income\" from employment that would be filed under THEIR system, since I don't and can't file \"private undertakings\". \n\nThere's a myriad of underlying implications here...\nFor example...if there is no MONEY exchanged between two private individuals...what can the government do to tax that? Since what is Caesars is his.. I guess he gets a cut....but a cow...ain't income!  (gee....who told me that...? ). It's really about government interfering with the private contract and associations of two free individuals that's my point. If I BARTER... Does Caesar want a few ribs and some steaks? \nCan he even ask for that...if it ISN'T \"employment income\"?",
