   "message": "its warming up, summer weather coming on, some people in the north are spending more time outside.\n\ni believe your mistaken, your defending your right to travel freely by automobile, THEY are trying to coerce you into a situation, which they have. you lost a challenge and are inquiring about it's appeal. the fact of the matter is you can appeal a criminal case, but i think not statutory because it's simply corporate policy. once that decision is made it's over, you cant be retried AND just because you may have lost it that time doesnt mean you wont win against them the next time.\n\nnow every county court, not district, has an attorney of the day available to speak to, and you can get for free at the superior court copies of filed cases as writings to base your own writing on, but the fact that your trying to style a writing in their manner is not necessary.\n\nyou just write the facts in plain language, have that notarized, and send it certified mail to the highest authority. believe me they will get back to you...",
