   "message": "It depends in what capacity you attend the court eg: amicus curiae or sui juris etc...\n\nIf you stand your ground & continually make it very clear that you are unable to understand the nature & cause of proceedings until the questions in the notice of mistake are answered, then how can you be dragged away if you are merely seeking answers and asking questions ie: remaining honourable?...\n\nIf, by your assertion you are still ignored & dragged away, then you have probably been kidnapped, so a writ of habeus corpus probably needs to be filed on your behalf...\n\nDean Kory's final court appearance audio discusses the notice of mistake & the thread re Dean Clifford's arrest & detainment discusses the notice of mistake & habeus corpus in the body of the comments in that thread (I think)...happy reading",
