   "message": "so of course this is nerv wracking as, I'm pretty easy going and all, but there was no pussing out, and I really did nothing wrong as far as I could tell anyway, but from the back of the police cruiser with the cuffs cranked on, and Harmony reading them the riot act, (she will have to recant her side) but there were several cops rifling through there code books, not sure why because they assured me I was going to jail if I didn't give them my name...and I had already made up my mind that I had done nothing to warrant this bullshit, so I was planning to see it through regardless...but I will say I was wishing I had Derek's police manual and Scott's \"in lieu of...\" handy...but I new I could keep my mouth shut and was pretty easy to remember, lol....",
