   "message": "so short version...ride check out front of my house, no biggy, I don't drink to speak of anyway...my son calls for a ride so Harm and I jump in her truck to go get him the ride check is set up so that i can exit behind it and not be bothered...on return... I should point out here (for those that don't know) where I live there is a large parking lot that separates my house from the \"house of god\" thus handy for said ride check...moving on, on our way back I turn down two streets before the check and come in the back way to the parking lot and park where I was originally (next to the ride check) we get out of the truck and proceed around to my yard when we hear \"HEY, HEY ..HEY!\" by this time I am in my yard when I turn to see it is me he is hollering at, so I wait for him. When he approaches he says \"identify yourself\", I said \"why would I have to do that? and he said \"you were driving, under the highway traffic act you have to identify yourself\" , and I said well I'm not even in my truck...and he said...well I saw you driving and under the hta you have to identify yourself...this may have went back and forth one two two times as I then said I would not be answering anymore of his questions, and then he got upset and said he would arrest me ...and he did, not to drag this out with too much I said he said...he asked more times than I can count for me to give him my name and I returned with \"I'm not answering any of your questions....",
