   "message": "O'Neil Brooke Oh how very interesting. They do not want you to communicate your experience with anyone else. The high priests do not want the common folk to document the abuses of the legal system. \n\nDean you are to be raped and this is to be done in such a way as others will find out but without any proof.\n\nThis is a difficult problem to address. If you have community support then others will demand to witness the court. If not, you are at their mercy.\nabout an hour ago via mobile � Like\n\nO'Neil Brooke Did the police leave any paper work for the home invasion?\nabout an hour ago via mobile � Like\n\nO'Neil Brooke Did they provide you with an inventory of the stuff stolen?\nabout an hour ago via mobile � Like\n\nO'Neil Brooke As I understand it the right to record is based on the right to make notes and the mechanism of making notes (hand written vs audio recording) is immaterial.\n\nhttp://www.canadacourtwatch.com/legal_documents/Article-RecordingYourOwnCourtHearing.pdf\n\nIt would be interesting to see the justification for denying you your right to free speech. Was a publication ban issued in this case? \n\nIs there a docket number we can search for?\nabout an hour ago via mobile � Like\n\nDean Kory so my understanding and supportive neighbours,(after witnessing the raid) provided me with a laptop free of charge ! i love smart people!...so ya! getting charged for audio recording the \"supernumerary\"in court where i was also charged for\"fail to appear\" before said court...cant wait to hear how they explain this one!\n12 minutes ago � Like\n\nDean Kory No publication ban as of yet...ill get the docket number asap!...thanks for all the info...gives me confidence to see good people helping!",
