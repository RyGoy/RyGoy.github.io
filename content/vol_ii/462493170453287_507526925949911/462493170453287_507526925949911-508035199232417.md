Manifest Destiny, in its broadest interpretation, meant that Americans were a chosen people ordained by God to create a model society. More specifically, it referred to the territorial expansion of the United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The idea of manifest Destiny was used to justify US annexation of Texas, Oregon, New Mexico, and California and later, US involvement in Cuba, Alaska, Hawaii and the Philippines\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine a cornerstone of early US foreign policy was enunciated by President James Monroe in a public statement proclaiming three basic dicta: no further European colonization in the New World, abstention of the United States from European political affairs, and non-intervention of European governments in the governments of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nIn 1881, its principles were evoked in discussing the development of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama. Theodore Roosevelt applied the Monroe doctrine with an extension that became known as the Roosevelt Corollary. The corollary stated that not only would the United States prohibit non-American intervention in Latin American affairs but it would also police there and guarantee that Latin American nations met their international obligation. The corollary sanctioning American intervention was applied in 1905 when Roosevelt forced the Dominican Republic to accept the appointment of an American economic adviser who quickly became the financial director of the small state. It was also used in the acquisition of the Panama Canal Zone from Colombia in 1903 and the formation of a provisional government in Cuba in 1906.\n\nmore at http://www.citeman.com/7908-manifest-destiny-and-the-monroe-doctrine.html#ixzz2RvdfNuAq",
