   "message": "I was also wondering about spirulina/blue green algae, nutritional yeast, and sea vegetables. I have read a few different sources that these contain iron, calcium, and various B vitamins (incl B-12). Unless I have the tools to break down and study foods on my own I have had to rely on reading whatever information I can get and \"experiment\" with myself to see what works. I obviously can't make any claims that anything I eat provides anything I need to have a the mineral and vitamin supply necessary for keeping my physical body in prime health. I can claim that I am not a vegetarian or a vegan (I do eat very little meat but probably would never give up dairy) and that I feel very strong and healthy.Scott Duncan, can you make some suggestions as to what to look for in peoples' writings/publications on their work to either give or take from the validity? You have mentioned peer review. Where does one look to find that? I am not experienced at researching others' work and taking belief away is definitely a start. But I can't know everything and you are constantly stating how detrimental it is to \"value\" the wrong things. Logic and reason backs that statement. Are there other tools besides logic, reason? How do you discern when you have no starting point of your own?",
