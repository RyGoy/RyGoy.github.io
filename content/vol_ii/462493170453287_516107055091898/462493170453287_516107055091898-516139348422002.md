   "message": "I do agree that the B12 in plant form is unusable in the human body, but yet there are vegans without a B12 deficiency. B12 is made by bacteria not animals. So perhaps that maybe the answer...either way my gut cannot absorb it regardless of what I eat. I can only absorb it through my mouth directly into my bloodstream by supplementation, a vegan form of B12 of course ;) made from bacteria in a dish not a stomach!",
