   "message": "I DID read the shit-stain that is the article. All it says is that \"vegans know different\" so don't worry it's a myth... then they say \"it's something else\" when the very real B-12 deficiency issue comes up... with links to \"WebMD' about anemia.\n\n...which still doesn't explain where all the missing shit comes from.\n\nYOU read the article. YOU mistakenly thought it had content. The declaration \"it's a myth\" is not a counter to the position that YOUR FUCKING DIET IS MISSING SHIT AND YOU PRETEND IT ISN'T.\n\nHere in REALITY, that's still true.",
