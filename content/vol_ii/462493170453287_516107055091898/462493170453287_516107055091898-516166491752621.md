   "message": "IF one eats a PROPER amount of plant based foods (not 1200 calories but a REAL 3000 for an adult male) then one should be free of b12 deficiency and IF not one can eat fortified foods (soy milk and others) to balance out their levels. I have ran my blood, I have no problems with b12, maybe I will later, if i do, I will take what I need but for now, I need NOTHING and neither do my Aunt or her 3 children.",
