   "message": "Seriously. You don't get to put your \"belief\" on the same shelf as my knowledge. I have forgotten more about \"nature\" than you will know in your lifetime.\n\nThe ability to map a genome is beyond your comprehension, and I am the THIRD GENERATION on the project. This didn't happen by \"opinion\".\n\nThere's no \"debate\". You are simply wrong/lying. Your \"knowledge\" is in the same category as psychics and dowsers. \n\nStudy ACTUAL nature, so you can counter the REAL threats to your diet. Because it will be deluded kooks like you who live off of \"belief\" that will do the damage.\n\nPretending to understand something, isn't the same as ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE, no matter how much you shake your fist at your monitor and call me \"arrogant\" and \"closed minded\".\n\nYou are not qualified to have this debate because we do not have a common frame of reference. I study reality. You guess, and parrot.",
