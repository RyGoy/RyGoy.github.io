   "message": "You have no evidence or even know me to make a determination like that. If you knew me you would know just the thought of eating another living being makes me sick to my stomach. To me it would be like eating a human living being. So me sneaking off eating those things you mention is out of the equation. Even with milk and cheese another living being is being treaty cruelly and suffering beyond my comprehension, not to mention the male offsprings are killed. If that makes me stupid because I can not harm another than so be it. Like I said I feel better than I ever have so why should I eat animals and participate in such cruelty? Besides I have a B12 deficiency whether I eat animals or not because it has to do with the absorption of B12.",
