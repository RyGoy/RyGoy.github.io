   "message": "HERE IN REALITY: TRUE vegan diets (no cheese, fish, milk) do NOT have even 1/4 of what you need in B-12. They just DON'T, and telling people that they do is both a lie, and harmful.\n\nAll of you claiming this isn't true and that your vegan diet shows it to be so, is unethical, dangerous and only serves to cover up the lie of commission (supplements, and beef jerky when nobody's looking).",
