   "message": "No thanks Scott, I tried while on meat and I could not train the way I can now, With meat I had to calorie restrict my food where as with fruits and veggies I can go up to 10K calories in a day and not gain a shred of body fat, Also my recovery time is between 22 and 24 hours, much less than any of my animal eating friends. Oh sorry and I eat a good amount of starches on my off training days, potatoes and rice.",
