   "message": "SO much wrong with this.\n\nFirst: Can all of you stop using GMO as a term until you LEARN WHAT A GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISM IS!\n\nHave a CAT, THAT'S A GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISM.\n\nEat CARROTS? THAT'S A GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISM.\n\nIncreasing genetic traits like wheat that grows ANYWHERE is NOT the same as \"FrankenFoods\" (See Monsanto Corn) where genes are spliced by people who have NO business touching a genome map of ANYTHING with more than 1 cell.\n\nOh...and do you work out with targeted routines to alter hormone levels, and increase muscle mass? YUP! YOU ARE A GMO!\n\nSo please kindly fuck off with the GMO crap until you get a clue what you are talking about?\n\nFarming? AGAIN, something you are not qualified to speak about! An \"organic farm\" is an \"organic\" scam. They don't exist. The ones that do, could not supply much beyond their own needs, muchless a supermarket chain. It's the science you so decry, that gave you your lunch. The magical food fairy doesn't stock shelves...and neither do your imaginary \"organic farms\".",
