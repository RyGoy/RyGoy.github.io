   "message": "Even animal eaters have b12 and iron deficiency issues.. so what are you trying to prove?  I'm pretty sure when I read your original question  it was asking where do the vitamins come from if you eat a vegan diet? So why dont you stick to that topic and prove to me that you cannot get B12 from a vegan diet or any other source before you make such claims. You really think Iron is something not available from any other source? Spinach.. tomato paste .. lentils .. soybeans.. ?? Hello?  I am confused as to what you are trying to prove because all you keep doing is coming back with words like \"shit stain\" with no real argument or proof or disproof. So what you state is only your opinion.. not proven fact.",
