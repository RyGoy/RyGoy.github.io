B12 is NOT specific to vegans, it also occurs in those that consume animal foods. Did you read the study I posted? Especially this part.\n\n*Vitamin B12 concentrations were also measured in a control group of 53 ministers who consumed fish, poultry or red meat on a regular basis. In this group 40 per cent had vitamin B12 concentrations below the recommended lower limit; this indicates that vitamin B12 deficiency is widespread even among non-vegetarians.*\n\nThere are tons of studies that show meat eaters being deficient too, all you need to do is look, and if you dont care to, please stop spreading bullshit.",
