   "message": "Fear is the tool of control. Humans are taught to live in fear and fear takes away the ability to act. In order to discard the yoke of fear know thyself. I am fearless. That may seem an arrogant statement and it does not mean my organic body does not react (adrenalin etc) when faced with a threat. I may be defeated by overwhelming force but I know I have defeated fear. I know who I am.",
