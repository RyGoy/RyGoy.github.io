   "message": "I have a long comment, Maximus Legis, but the short version is this.  The definition of insane is, by definition, insane.  You can easily prove that most people can't tell the difference between reality and fantasy.  Is it, for instance, fantasy or reality to believe that an omnipresent imaginary caretaker oversees the actions of billions of people, providing their value systems and answering the most banal requests?  Is it fantasy or reality to believe entrusting your children for care and instruction is best left in the hands of known Pedophiles?  Would a sane person kill himself (or another) for coloured pieces of paper?  Is it sane to believe that a piece of hardened carbon should cost thousands of dollars or be exchanged for love or sex?  What sane person needs 100 pairs of shoes?",
