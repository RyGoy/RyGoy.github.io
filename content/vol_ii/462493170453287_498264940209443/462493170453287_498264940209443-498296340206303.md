   "message": "I really like that question Joseph Pierre Gilles.  I was thinking about it earlier today but just didn't work up the enthusiasm to get a point across.  I think we have become lazy and stupid as some have said.  To borrow from Scott Duncan, we value the wrong things.  And we're so addicted to not saying or doing the wrong things for fear of being inconvenienced, punished or unliked that we're afraid of doing anything.  We're actually now afraid of being afraid.  It's like finding yourself in a really bad relationship and realizing that you have gotten there by compromising a little at a time until you don't recognise yourself any more.  And the funny thing is that every one else, having done exactly the same thing, thinks that is the best you can hope for.  The less funny thing is that the people and systems responsible for metering out these various financial and penal punishments are actually funded by us, and supported by your friends and neighbours and families.  So how, and when did we get here?  That I can't answer.  The situation is thick with irony though.  This would actually be funny if it wasn't sad.",
