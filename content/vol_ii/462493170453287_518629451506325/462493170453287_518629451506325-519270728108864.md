   "message": "That reminds me of something really funny from way back. I was walking along the street with a friend and a police car passed with the cops staring at us. They were well outwith earshot. We both noticed them watching us and I said to my friend \"Fucking Pigs\". 5 minutes later whilst standing in the pub enjoying a beer, I got a tap on the shoulder. There stood the two cops. One challenged me for calling them Fucking Pigs, I asked him how he could possibly hear from that distance what I said. He replied that he lip read my words. I told him he missed the rest of the conversation and I had actually said \"Have you ever tried fucking pigs?\"  to my friend, who answered \"Of course not you fucking pervert!\" The cop/s turned around and left. True story lol :-)",
