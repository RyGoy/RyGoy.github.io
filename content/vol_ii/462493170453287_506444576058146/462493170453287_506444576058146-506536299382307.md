   "message": "rather then defend ill share..\n\nThe post had a question and this would be one answer..\n\nHere is an administrative process of using notices to offer discussion to avoid conflict and secure a declaratory judgement is the simplest remedy.

You will find the enclosed intact and complete.\n\nI ____________ of the ______________ family , a flesh and blood living soul do hereby make oath and state the following is my truth and my law.\n\nWhereas : it is my understanding that America and all her people enjoy the protection of common-law and it is my understanding that all living beings (flesh and blood) are created equally under one creator and it is my understanding that we are sharing this existence on Earth together under our creator and it is my understanding that we have been given a conscience to deliberate and make decisions for ourselves and it is my understanding that equality before the law is paramount and mandatory and it is my understanding that a statute is defined as a legislative rule of society which has been given the force of law, and it is my understanding that a society is defined as a number of people joined by mutual consent to deliberate, determine and act for a common goal and it is my understanding that the government of America is a Representative Body and Representation can only come from consent and\n\nWhereas I am a peaceful and responsible human being and it is my understanding that peace officers have a duty to distinguish between statute and law and Whereas I have the power to refuse intercourse or interaction with peace officers who have not observed me breach the peace Whereas permanent estoppel by acquiescence barring any peace officer or prosecutor from bringing charges against a Freeman-of-the-Land under any act is created if this claim is not responded to in the stated fashion and time.\n\nTherefore be it now known to any and all concerned and effected parties, that I, (____________ of the ______________ family ) a Sovereign Freeman-on-the-Land do hereby state clearly and specifically and unequivocally my intent to peacefully lawfully exist free of all statutory obligations restrictions and maintain all rights at law and trade, exchange and barter.\n\nFurthermore: I claim the right not to apply for licenses, permits or to seek permission to do any action, that are already lawful,\n\nI claim the right to exercise my \"common law right to travel\", unhindered, unencumbered, at my discretion in my private conveyance of the day, to wit, my private, unregistered, unlicensed mechanically propelled automobile,\n\nI claim the right to possess, cultivate or use medicinally any plant or other medicine.

I Also swear to come to the aide of any peace officer should they request my assistance. That is my personal oath.\n\nFurthermore, I claim that the intentional blurring of the lines and the failure to define between that which is legal, and that which is lawful in order to extract capital from the masses by legislating freedom and then putting a price tag on it is a crime on Man, and the failure to define between the Natural man and the State created Fiction is nothing short of fraud, theft, breach of trust and forced slavery, a heinous criminal activity of the most odious form.\n\nI claim that the courts in the United Staets of America are de-facto and are in fact in the profitable business of conducting, witnessing and facilitating the transactions of security interests and I furthermore claim that they require the consent of both parties prior to providing any such services.\n\nI claim that anyone who interferes with my lawful activities after having been served notice of this claim and who fails to properly dispute or make lawful counterclaim is breaking the law, cannot claim good faith or colour of right and that such transgressions will be dealt with in a properly convened court de jure.\n\nFurthermore, I claim all transactions of security interests require the consent of both parties and I do herby deny consent to any transaction of a security interest issuing under any Act for as herein stated as a Freeman-on-the-Land I am not subject to any Act.\n\nFurthermore, I claim my FEE SCHEDULE for any transgressions by peace officers, government principals or agents or justice system participants is (1oz of gold ) ONE OUNCE OF GOLD ($1,366.00) per hour or portion thereof if being questioned, interrogated or in any way detained, harassed, searched or otherwise regulated and (5oz of gold) FIVE OUNCES OF GOLD ($6,830.00) per hour or portion thereof if I am handcuffed, transported, incarcerated or subjected to any adjudication process without my express written and Notarized consent.]\n\nFurthermore, I state that it is my duty to Claim such rights, to protect them and ensure they exist for future generations.Furthermore, I claim that the law of agent and principal does apply and that service upon one is equal to both.Furthermore, I claim the right to deal with any counterclaims or disputes publicly and in an open forum using discussion and negotiation and to capture on video tape said discussion and negotiation for whatever lawful purpose I see fit.\n\nResponses must be under Oath attestation, upon full commercial liability and penalty of perjury and registered in the Notary Office herein provided no later than ten days from the date of original service as attested to by way of certification of service.\n\nFailure to register a dispute against the claims made herein will result in an automatic default judgment and permanent and irrevocable estoppel by acquiescence barring the bringing of charges under any statute or Act against My Self\n\nSigned: .\n\nWitness: .\n\nNotary: .\n\n(You print this up, have it notarized, and the Notary Public puts this original in the file and holds this original Bill of exchange for collection along with the first one. The Notary sends a certified true copy, in my case to the Sheriff. If the Sheriff registers a response he may pick up both of the original bills of exchange and all is done. If there is no response the next notice is crafted by the Notary, and placed into your file, sending another certified copy of that Notice to the Sheriff.)\n\n--------------------------------\n",
