   "message": "NOTICE OF TRUTH AND INTENT\nTo whom it may concern,Including but not limited to The corporation of canada and all agents therein and Her Magesty the queen of England.\n It is with a heavy heart that I write this notice of truth and letter of intent.\n\nDuring the last few years I have witnessed through my own personal experience and others great injustices and unhonourable actions that have greatly affected my life and those of the honourable people around me.\n\nI have spent the last few years disabled and suffering with chronic pain,slowly and painfully watching as my quality of life disapated,after years of suffering and finaly learning how to take measures into my own hands I discovered that the medical community was not forth coming in proper diagnoses,once I discovered and was able to seek and find proper diagnoses and viable treatment and was able to begin my journey back to good financial standing,I discovered that there was no work to be had,my dealings with the department of community services not to mention the amount I recieved per month to survive on were less than favorable,for the purpose of this notice of truth and intent I will simply say I would be willing to discuss details with any interested parties,thus not making this to long of a read.\nNeedless to say once I realized the dishonesty around me I decided I must take responsibility for my own life and well being,I began a journey of research and education given what I learned I was able to cure myself and take a active role in trying to better our world,the details of this I will also spare the reader and be open to discussion about anytime.\n\nMy father was a career servicemen in her Magesty's navy,my whole life I was raised to be honourable to look out for my fellow man and not bare false witness to injustice,my spiritual rules I live by command the same thing.....hence my oath to our father and creator to do no harm to another man or his property and to not commit fraud I believe that in these times of so very much corruption and lack of transperancy it is not only vital for good men and women to stand up to these same morals but imparative that we do so and in the absence of such action by those representatives in higher places of power and social standing?one has the right indeed the duty to be seperate of such unclean and unhonourable things.",
