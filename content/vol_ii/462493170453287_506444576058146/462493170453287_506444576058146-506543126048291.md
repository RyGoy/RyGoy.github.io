   "message": "A few things to RESEARCH and apply to life.. \n\n1. EVERYONE is EQUAL under and before the law. \n\n2. EVERY individual is literally Sovereign king or queen ( I know ya love this one ;), but our dominion extends only to our own affairs . \n\n3.Every individual shares an equal capacity to claim and exercise rights freely, and to engage in any activity they choose so long as no actual harm comes to another. \n\n4. NO ONE requires a permit to exercise ANY right. \n\n5. LAW, is the lawful defense of our individual Rights.\n\n6. NO ONE can claim ignorance of the law, because the law IS the lawful rights of the individual, and as we all share the same rights equally, everyone is aware of what they do not want done to them by others. \n\n7. CRIME is ALWAYS a trespass upon another's freedom or property. \n\n8. In order to break THE LAW, you MUST cause ACTUAL damage or injury to person or property, or ACTUAL violation of another's rights. \n\n9. STATUTORY RULES are just contractual terms and conditions (given force of law by your consent ;) . \n\n10. ALL contracts are voluntary and must provide full disclosure of the terms and conditions. \n\n11. SOVEREIGNTY simply means the highest authority, and ALL individuals are sovereign over their own affairs and property.\n\n\"Sovereignty exchanged for Citizenship=Rights relinquished for benefits.\"\n\n�Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to law, for it is the author and source of law; but in our system, while sovereign powers are delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty itself remains with the people, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts.�\n",
