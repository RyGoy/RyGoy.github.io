See i have issues with this whole i am leaving the corporation of so and so, simply its unrealistic and childish, because after all are we actually part of the corporation or are we shareholders?\"\n\nIf we make the choice to be shareholder then yes we are part of that system/corporation as \"shareholder\" at least. Shareholders hold responsibility for what the corporation does most certainly when said shareholder has clear Knowledge about the corporation violating so many rights and committing so many crimes against you and I and our people. \n\nI won't hold judgement on any man for life choices he Feels he has to make as long as his Heart's Right..\n\nThat Would be a bit childish of me my friend ;) \n",
