   "message": "OK, I won't even touch on the redundant fallacy \"Notice of Truth\" presents, because you clearly have no idea what most of the words you are using MEAN. Some you just make up... (unhonourable?)\n\nYou need to do a LOT more reading, before you decide what TRUTH is.\n\nGiving notice acknowledges their authority. Notices are always IN RESPONSE to something.\n\nI have a higher rank than the government and CERTAINLY more \"Authority\", so why didn't I get a notice too? :D",
