   "message": "Something is being sprayed SOMETIMES.\n\nI see a lot of long exposure shots PRETENDING to be \"chemtrails\", that's for sure. I know this because one of the MOST USED ones, is actually one that a colleague took as an example of how to fake shit without photoshop.\n\nI do not know when/what shit is being sprayed. It's happened since the early 1900's, but that does not make it POLICY or even COMMON. This subject has a lot of pseudo-experts (Assholes who \"know\" all this shit, without having any actual experience) who make declarations, without ANY actual knowledge of science.",
