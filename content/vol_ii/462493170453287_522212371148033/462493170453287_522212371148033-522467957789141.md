   "message": "Check the FACT that this guy's FACTS come from a controlled environment that doesn't allow any real FACTS to be considered or even mentioned if those FACTS go against the propaganda they are promoting. Then it becomes clear that the FACTS this clown is relying on are nothing more than a manufactured consensus reality predetermined for you by a corrupt scientific, medical, and corporate agricultural system. Check the FACTS that GMO foods cause cancer, infertility, lower yields, superbugs resistant to their insecticides, and a number of other maladies they won't allow the tightly controlled, peer reviewed scientific or medical community to even mention. That's not looking at the fence, that's what you see when you realize the truth that there is no fence. That guy is full of shit and he's about as sharp as a fucking bowling pin.",
