   "message": "Ok, read Nick's post from earlier:\"Just let me know if you want more... unless you are happy with mr intelligent's 5 second google searches and infuriating agro ranting and hate speech laced with ignorance and willful negligence, there is a mountain of this shit...\"\n\nNotice that NOT ONCE does he think that this is all Op-Ed pieces. It never crosses his mind. Just an endorphin reward response to a \"successful\" Google search. \n\nGoebells did the same thing; Saturated libraries with op-ed pieces geared to EMOTION, not thought.\n\nIf you think I was harsh with ol' Nick, remember that his kind dont care how you suffer as long as the goal is met. He doesn't know WHY, it just gives him \"purpose\"... empathy and rational thought are replaced with \"purpose\". His kind are the biggest threat to your freedom. Make NO mistake. History reveals how true this is.",
