   "message": "This is what is the hardest part most fail too see. That what they have been told is in fact a big lie. all of it is a big fat lie. because what I once had value in,is  now in question. Myself wants to believe the lie because the truth would mean I was wrong and I did it too myself. then the ego steps in (which is also programmed) and tells me now you could not have been wrong keep believing in the stuff you learned.",
