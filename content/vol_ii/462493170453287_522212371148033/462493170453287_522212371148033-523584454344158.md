   "message": "FEAR is overwhelming us. This makes us gullible as it significantly reduces our ability to think critically and rationally. While we may see patterns and find SEEMINGLY RATIONAL explanations being touted by \"CREDIBLE SOURCES\" within those patterns we incoherently identify, we ourselves are unable to grasp much of anything. For example; nobody can build a computer, as the technology is beyond several lifetimes of a single person. In short, we are highly inexperienced people, lost in details that we can likely never truly verify; in short we have forgotten HOW TO THINK and when we do it's likely it will be about the WRONG THINGS. We have lost what is real and important. We have lost ourselves.",
