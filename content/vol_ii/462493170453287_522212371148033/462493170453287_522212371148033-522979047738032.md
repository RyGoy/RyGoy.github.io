   "message": "I love how you people post things claiming to be backed by \"science\", not realizing that NONE of you know what science is.\n\n\"A College Degree is nothing more than a Government Work Permit\" - NO... NOT FOR SCIENCE. Your degree is an indicator that you can discuss a particular field of science at a particular level. It also obligates you to teach those students who ask.\n\n\"Science rarely discusses UFOs\" - WHAT? Ok, what does the U in UFO stand for?\n\nWHY THE FUCK ARE THERE SO MANY \"EXPERTS\" ON UNIDENTIFIED SHIT? SERIOUSLY! WHY ARE YOU ALL SO FUCKING CREDULOUS?\n\nNONE OF YOU CAN THINK!",
