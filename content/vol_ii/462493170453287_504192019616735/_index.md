You on the other hand, will be muzzled unless I say otherwise, but you'll never be prevented from READING)\nNo rules dictated by third parties\nNo censored posts...because I control it, not a third party\n\nBut above all, NO FUCKING CHARGE! Not even a \"manditory donation\" like other places I could mention...\n\nThe shovel goes into the ground on this construction project.\n\nTheTenderForLaw.com - Enough said.\n\n",
