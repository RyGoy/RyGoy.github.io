Cuz religion, politics (esp pro this and anti that ) I can surely do without.\n\nI like your comment Scott...my dad is a PhD and insisted on teaching high school even though he was overqualified...because it was about educating at what he felt was the level he could make the most impact , and took huge pay cuts in doing so...and didnt care.
