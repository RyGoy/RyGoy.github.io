I am seeking someone in the local area Quebec, near Montreal to be a witness to my process, meaning that I need someone to swear under oath, or as a man, that they witness no response to my process. I probably would need to have the return  address be yours as you would be witness to the none response. I will exchange likewise, as a 3rd party witness to anything you might need providing it is by mail process. Transportation is a problem with me. my offer....how say you?",
