   "message": "so you have an issue withthe DL being suspended, which you dont need to have anyways. but never the less it exists. so you write an affadavit, notarized, send copies to the party who gives permit to 'drive' and specifically recind any/all presumtions of their even having been a lawful contract agreement and that you specify that they remove all refference to the name, address, all numbers, from their records AND to provide you withthe copy of the details of them having performed such with notice that if they do not get that data back you you that your presumtion of that fact has been remedied within 30 days, then send them notice of the 30 days having passed and all presumptions of their never having been a lawful contract between the parties has been expunged. (because they probably wont send you anything).",
