   "message": "We have returned ... no positive outcome. We didn't kick arse as expected.\nWe identified ourself as a 'MAN' and who reserved all rights. That's as far as we were allowed to proceed. We were told to leave and the case would be heard, in absentia, against the 'PERSON'. They cannot deal with a 'MAN', but only a 'PERSON'.\nWe have another hearing on Friday, but not for the same case as today ... consequently, it will just be the same shit, different day.\nProsecution will have to SUMMONS the PERSON, which, we being a MAN, we cannot accept.\nThis will probably continue ad nauseum.",
