   "message": "Colin S Tonks I applaud your effort, after I was lied to by an assistant clerk of the court about my next appearance date a few weeks ago I guess the warrant for my arrest has finally been issued bailable for 10% of 10,000.00 (1,000.00). These jerks want to make it tough and I need to get organized real quick, my goal is to get the warrant and case dropped without appearing ( I appeared 3times so far).",
