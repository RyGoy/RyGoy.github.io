   "message": "So I went to the hospital to seek medical attention for the injuries sustained from the assault by officer Boutin and to make a record of this,I provided the hospital with my public notice and notice of mistake as I.D. I also went to the police service where i waited for 2 and a half hours to speak to an officer about filing a formal complaint against officer Boutin and report the assault and theft of my recording device...the officer told me that the digital audio recorder has been seized as evidence because there is further court hearings recorded on it!(funny how this wasn't mentioned to me at the time of the assault)...",
