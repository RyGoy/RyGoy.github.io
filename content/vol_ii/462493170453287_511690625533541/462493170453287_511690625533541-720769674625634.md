   "message": "I don`t know if this has been stated here in this group yet but gold is no different then money. A value is assigned to both and we accept it with out question . In  times where economic uncertainty  abound like now days people are told directed to buy gold to preserve their wealth ................Nothing could be further from the truth ........when  you buy gold you preserve the class system already in place you ensure that those with more gold will always make the decisions that will effect your life in the future",
