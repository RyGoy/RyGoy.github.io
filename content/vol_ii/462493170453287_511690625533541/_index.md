   "message": "the MONEY is actually GOLD threads all consolidated into one featuring lots of gold from one SCOTT DUNCAN.....\n\nMoney is GOLD.. thats why Chief Justice Bora Laskin mentioned it 27 times in this case: Supreme Court of Canada, Bank of Canada v. Bank of Montreal, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 1148\n\n[Page 1169]\n\nIt is not so with notes of the Bank of Canada; assuming that gold IS money, notes of the Bank of Canada cannot and could never have been paid in gold and, since such notes are and were the only legal tender, they could not be discharged by the payment of anything which is different from themselves. If the holder of a $5 note of the Bank of Canada were to present it to the Bank for payment he could be dismissed or he could be told: �You already have $5�.\n\nhttps://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=gold&language=en&searchTitle=Canada+%28Federal%29+-+Supreme+Court+of+Canada&path=%2Fen%2Fca%2Fscc%2Fdoc%2F1977%2F1977canlii36%2F1977canlii36.html\n\nScott Duncan:  THIS is GOLD, and I am beginning to suspect Derek Moran spends a little more time than is healthy, on CanLII.\n\nMoney IS Gold.. so how come nobody knows about that? Because Gold was effectively made illegal by the U.S. and Canada in 1933.. the U.S. proof is HJR 192, and Canada's is Order-in-Council No.16 April 10, 1933, and here are copies of that from:\n\n http://www.stoptherobbery.com/Order%20in%20council%2016%20-%20page%201.jpg, and, http://www.stoptherobbery.com/Order%20in%20council%2016%20-%20page%202.jpg\n\nSo if money is GOLD.. and GOLD/money has effectively been made illegal since April 10, 1933 with Order-in-Council No.16.....what is considered in lieu of, to be 'money' now in its place? see FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION ACT: http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/page-1.html#h-2\n\nScott Duncan: \"What is considered in lieu of, to be 'money' now in its place\"? - THAT was the question.\n\nNow the ACTUAL answer. You can read the Bills Of Exchange act...then the interpretation act (assuming you know what the words MEAN, and most of you don't) because there's a few things they need to shuffle around, so nobody clues in...\n\n...or you can cheat, and just read what I say:\nOn April 10, 1933, PAYMENT became illegal, NOT MONEY.\n\n�negotiable instrument� includes any cheque, draft, traveller�s cheque, bill of exchange, postal note, money order, postal remittance and any other similar instrument;\n\n�money� includes negotiable instruments;\n\nhttp://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/page-1.html#h-2\n\nso if the Financial Administration Act says that �money� includes(means and means only) negotiable instruments; then whats considered a 'negotiable instrument' in the Financial Administration Act?\n\n�negotiable instrument� includes any cheque, draft, traveller�s cheque, bill of exchange, postal note, money order, postal remittance and any other similar instrument;\n\nhttp://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/page-1.html#h-2\n\nDerek Moran: its like the film INCEPTION, there's always another level.. money = negotiable instruments.. negotiable instruments = any cheque, draft, traveller�s cheque, bill of exchange, postal note, money order, postal remittance and any other similar instrument.. HENCE, money = any cheque, draft, traveller�s cheque, bill of exchange, postal note, money order, postal remittance and any other similar instrument.......this is a PUZZLE, and our public-servants like to keep the pieces spread out from us \n\nScott Duncan: The moral of the movie Inception:\n\nIf you run a virtual machine,\ninside a virtual machine,\ninside a virtual machine,\ninside a virtual machine,\n...it runs very, very slowly.\n\nFINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION ACT: �money� includes negotiable instruments;\n\nBut what does \"includes\" - the trickiest word in the 'illegal-system,' really mean?\n\nMartin's Criminal Code: section 379. \"Trading stamps,\" Annotations - The definition of \"trading stamps\" in this section is EXHAUSTIVE notwithstanding the use of the word \"includes\": R. v. Loblaw Groceterias Co. (Man.) Ltd. ; R. v. Thomson (Niagara IGA Grocery), [1961] S.C.R. 138, 129 C.C.C. 223 (5:0).\n\nThis simply means.. \"money\" includes negotiable instruments = \"money\" means negotiable instruments = \"money\" is negotiable instruments = \"money\" means and only is, negotiable instruments.......... the fact that they didnt just use 'means' in place of 'includes' to begin with, is just clear evidence of their intent to try and mislead-and-deceive us through the use of this obfuscating-language meant only to keep us confused\n\nAndrew Langevin: The inclusion of one thing is the exclusion of another.\n\nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/include\ninclude\nlegal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com\nDefinition of include in the Legal Dictionary by TheFreeDictionary.com\n\nScott Duncan: All promissory notes buy...is other promissory notes. The title, and associated LEGAL status are part of the CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF THAT PROMISE.\n\nNo \"payment\" is ever made. You simply make enough promises to cancel any debt.\n\nDerek Moran: Now-now Scott, you've misrepresented my words, you need to go back and see that what i said was- \"..GOLD/money has effectively been made illegal since April 10, 1933 with Order-in-Council No.16..\" - and if i had to write that over again i suppose to be clearer i would've put- \"GOLD-as-money\"....this is all technical anyways so this hair-splitting is just good practice \n\nScott Duncan: I concede the point. As you were the author of the post, your intent trumps any ambiguity.\n\nPAYMENT, is what is actually illegal, so as soon as it's legal again, I will gladly pay you for any damages my misquote may have caused. \n\nHmm - well look at that..one of the examples given for the definition of a \"negotiable instrument,\" is a bill of exchange - well how many different examples of a bill of exchange are there? Wait a second, in this part of the Bills of Exchange Act 1985 http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-4/page-36.html#h-27, it says one of the examples of a bill of exchange - are PROMISSORY NOTES...but when you look at a dollar-bill/legal-tender, it says on it - 'This Note is Legal Tender'..then, you look at the definition of a Note in the Bills of Exchange Act it says- �note� means promissory note; hmmmmmm.......so i guess that just means then, that if a legal-tender-note, is considered to be a promissory note, and a promissory note is considered to be a bill of exchange, and bill of exchange is considered to be a negotiable instrument, and a negotiable instrument is considered as whats left to be known as money in lieu of Gold being made illegal for payment back in 1933, then...i guess that just means...a legal-tender-promissory-note just constitutes part of what is considered to be 'lawful-money' these days, also.....................................................or IS IT?? ;)\n\nScott Duncan: LEGAL TENDER = TENDER FOR LAW\n\nFree bonus, It's also a promissory note!\n\nWhy has nobody asked WHICH law?\n\nScott Duncan: Seriously people, you're awake, and it's time to get out of bed.\n\nI can't be the oracle giving google-like snippets when a question is asked. You need to ask the right questions. I can't just \"tell you\".\n\nScott Duncan: Derek Moran: You see a bit clearer then the rest here, but you are focused on the WRONG THING.\n\nDerek Moran: ..yes, there is another shoe yet-to-drop regarding THIS type of promissory-note\n\nJoseph Pierre Gilles: got a question here Scott ...what LAw are we talking about ????\n\nScott Duncan: Whatever law governs the trustee, of course! \n\nDerek Moran:  this is why the Bills of Exchange Act 1985 is probably the best Act they have:\nCommon law of England - 9. The rules of the common law of England, including the law merchant, save in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, apply to bills, notes and cheques.\n\nScott Duncan: If you want to buy shit with AQUILAE currency, you can; but the tender for law will be governed by AQUILAE.\n\nScott Duncan: Governed...like the GOVERNER of the Bank of Canada? \n\nScott Duncan: Yes Scott. That is why the Bank of Canada has a GOVERNOR.\n\nSo a legal-tender-promissory-note just constitutes part of what is considered to be 'lawful-money' these days also? I had resigned myself to accept this to be fact for awhile there, until, i stumbled-upon going through Detax-Canada's website again: http://www.detaxcanada.org/ - where he also includes a link to the CanLII Bank of Canada Act: http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-b-2/latest/rsc-1985-c-b-2.html - regarding section 25.6: NOTE ISSUE - Distinction\n\n(6) Notes of the Bank are neither promissory notes nor bills of exchange within the meaning of the Bills of Exchange Act.\n\nScott Duncan: A bank cannot promise what it does not have.\nThe thing about banking is that BOTH parties come to the table with NOTHING, so they therefore can offer NOTHING.\n\nBank notes are SURETY for \"money\". Yes, they promise, to deliver...a promise.",
