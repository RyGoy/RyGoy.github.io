   "message": "Well, Ed O'Eamonn O Brien, I'm not even sure I know what \"knowing the law\" means anymore.  We can all know you shouldn't kill people, take their things through theft or fraud.  But should we also know how to write a compelling brief, how to defend an important point viva voce, or that we can't build a birdhouse in some municipalities?  And what do you do when you acquire this mystical enlightenment only to find out that those who have sworn to uphold these principals are colouring outside the lines?",
