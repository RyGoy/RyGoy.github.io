   "message": "Officers\n\nIgnorance of the Law does not excuse misconduct in anyone, least of all a sworn officer of the law. \nSummonses or citations should not be granted before it is expressed under the circumstances whether the summons ought to be made. \nA delegated power cannot be again delegated. A deputy cannot appoint a deputy. \nAn office ought to be injurious to no one. \nA neglected duty often works as much against the interests as a duty wrongfully performed. \nFailure to enforce the law does not change it. \nIt is contrary to the Law of Nations to do violence to Ambassadors. \nAn Ambassador fills the place of the king by whom he is sent, and is to be honored as he is whose place he fills. \nThe greatest enemies to peace are force and wrong. \nForce and wrong are greatly contrary to peace. \nForce is inimical to the laws.",
