   "message": "Scott on why NUMBERS/the number ZERO is the most powerful number. . . . .\n\nScott Duncan: Seriously? You REALLY think math is BELIEF?\n\nScott Duncan: \"How do you know that two is a concept that exist outside your brain?\" - because Fuck Off. That's why.\n\nNumbers are observations, not creations like language. Threre are no Pakistani Prime Numbers. I know because I UNDERSTAND math, not conceptualize it, like you.\n\nScott Duncan: If aliens could visit Earth, they would test for intelligence with prime numbers.\n\nScott Duncan: Zero is the most powerful number.\n\nThe romans made THEIR numbers to HIDE it.\n\nScott Duncan: They made numbers that could do accounting...AND NOTHING ELSE!\n\nScott Duncan: That precious number zero. Hidden ON PURPOSE to keep the masses C***-Grade. \n\nScott Duncan: The \"NAND Gate\" and the \"NOR Gate\". Give me unlimited copies, and I can build ANYTHING. This is the first 20th century example of applied computer science. ALL electronics are based on these 2 concepts. That concept will NEVER die.\n\nScott Duncan: James Baal - You mis-apply the Socratic method.\n\nI am on the 29th floor in a tower in downtown Toronto. I know if I take the FASTEST way down, I will die. I cannot be \"flexible\" on this position. Physics is working against my interests. NO amount of NEW knowledge will change that reality.\n\nScott Duncan: No, the debts are \"forgiven\" in canon law.",
