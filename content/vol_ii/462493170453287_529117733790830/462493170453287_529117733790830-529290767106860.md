   "message": "yes but the rest of the movement would not stand back and watch (hopefully) and those that did would be as guilty as the perpatrator no ? Some people think these guys have a right to do whatever they want because they wear a uniform and that is as wrong as the one doing it as they will always do it because of the support they have from believers. I would not stand by and watch them assault anyone i do not fear them if there were more like me it would not be a problem. I don't think anyone deserves violence brought upon them in an ideal world but passive only gets you being the one kicked by these power hungry animals. I do see what you're saying i can accept i am thinking wrong here and your comments have shown me a flaw but my position has come from years of abuse so it's hard to dismiss based on what you have said up till now how else can we stop them?",
