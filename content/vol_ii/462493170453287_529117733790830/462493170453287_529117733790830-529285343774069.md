   "message": "I do see your point Scott Duncan but is them supporting what cops do when presented with evidence to the contrary no better than a blind belief that they are infallible. I have been assaulted numerous times by these people and the response i get from people is well you must of annoyed them somehow by asking the wrong questions or being \"cheeky\". To me those people are no better than those sympathetic to religious beliefs as even clear cut evidence does not change their position. I think the government would rather pack it all in than have me around i make a terrible servant. I am applying the logic of you can either be the problem or the solution and things cannot change while people view these people as infallible and are \"only doing their job\". This is obviously something i think wrong about but i find it hard not to as people walk by and watch and do nothing perhaps when it happens to them their mindset will be different.",
