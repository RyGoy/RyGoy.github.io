   "message": "Kill the people who give the orders, comes to mind, but that just opens the door for the next, even worse douchebag to replace him, so it's not practical.\n\nThe fact that you notice there is a problem is a good sign, but I have no solution for you. I'm just the messenger.\n\nEvery day, I ponder slitting the throats of those who have harmed me, and those I care about, in the past year> I think I would enjoy it...\n\n...but I will enjoy it more when I pull the whole thing down. That's the thing; despite the fact that every government official will label ANYONE who questions authority as \"crazy\", I know I'm not.\n\nI also know that because I am a thinking, rational man, I can say with certainty that if I think someone should be dead 5 years after the fact, then they probably should be... and it's a foregone conclusion that OTHERS feel the same way. \n\nI call this 5 year waiting period, \"Padding the suspect list\".\n\n...and police only \"solve\" 40% of homicides, and the ones they DO get are mostly confessions. If they don't have their suspect in the first 2 days, they probably never will. I like to have at least 5 suspects ahead of me...that will take FAR longer than 48 hours to investigate...and no real result.\n\nNeed to kill? Wait 5 years.",
