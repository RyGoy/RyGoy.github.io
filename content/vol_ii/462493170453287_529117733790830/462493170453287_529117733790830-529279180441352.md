   "message": "Carl Dunne, you are advocating the very \"thought crime\" concept, that those who are in \"authority\" think is THEIR right to \"police\". Perhaps you are looking for a government job! :D\n\nDon't become what you behold.\n\n\"They support those that would commit violence on me \" means every Muslim on the planet falls under that category... Should violence be inflicted on them?\n\nIf being a stupid moron who believes stupid shit is suddenly a justification for violence, should I start killing off the Christians?\n\nNo?\n\nCan you see the slippery slope \"thought crime\" sends you down?",
