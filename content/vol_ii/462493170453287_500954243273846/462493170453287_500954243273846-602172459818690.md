   "message": "Scott Duncan Hint:A numbered corporation has no SIN.\n\nYour name isn't yours either.\n\nBeverly Berta Braakschmack So your company should lien the \"vessel\" as a martime lien and all acts in commerce are done through the company...?\n\nScott Duncan Yes\n\nScott Duncan Put in the corporate charter that the corporation holds a TRUST. Live off that.\n\nBeverly Berta Braakschmack Doesn't it turn your name into a vessel for commerce?\n\nScott Duncan Yes.\n\nBeverly Berta Braakschmack kinda like a permission slip\n\nBeverly Berta Braakschmack to function in the world of promises...\n\nDerek Moran HOWEVER, there's a BIG difference Scott between the $20 Bill that says THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER and the BIRTH CERTIFICATE......that being, the Birth Certificate DOES NOT have on it anywhere THIS BANK-NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER thereby giving us proper NOTICE that they are making an OFFER FOR LAW to us, correct?\n\nScott Duncan Correct, but you are the BENEFICIARY. the onus is on YOU to know your rights/duties regarding commerce (which this bond allows transactions in)\n\nScott Duncan Thanks Willie. Usually I'm the one who points this out, but it's all white-noise to them now.\n\nIt's simple. Lien the Birth Certificate, and walk away. Don't \"notify\" strangers that you are an idiot. They already suspect it, so you don't need to confirm.",
