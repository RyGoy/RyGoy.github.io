   "message": "I am always amazed at the bull that is posted all the times about the BC. The UN charter states that a legal person has to be created for every human on the planet, so what do you think the BC is .Proof that the government has done so, so what is your problem? \n\nThe posting was about how many have incorporated so that they do not have to file tax returns with the SIN. WHY those are the derivatives created  from the legal person . Probably over you heads . That�s why only one in a million figure this out. \n\nNotice for what ?\n\nSo you can prove that you don�t know what you are doing?\nIf you cannot claim the derivatives through the SIN then there has to be another way. That was what the question was about. Taking a consensus to see how many have done so.\n\nConclusion ZERO",
