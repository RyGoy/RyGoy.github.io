   "message": "for all the smart people\n\nHint  The SSN is owned by the IRS something they don�t want the public to know.  That�s why the CRA hates me . I asked them to prove that I was the owner of the SIN.   I called their bluff.\nNow since we cannot use someone else�s property without conditions of use, therefore  we must incorporate but not normally done with the legal name  Smart people choose to a numbered company its easier to hide behind.\nSo now you genius who has incorporated so they don�t have use the SIN for tax reporting?",
