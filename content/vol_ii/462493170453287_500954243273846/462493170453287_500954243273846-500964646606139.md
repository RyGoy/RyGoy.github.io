   "message": "Why is that you keep referring to MEADS VS MEADS? Anybody with any internal information knows that this case has no bearing and was poorly presented in court.  Also anybody with any understanding of corporate workings knows you cannot sue yourself. Some of us know how to hit the lawyers back hard, that is: to make them and the alleged creditors ect responsible for the taxes through the tax agency. You can have your say in court but not with the CRA and IRS.  If the CRA and IRS have to abide to international law by tax treaties, then that is all that us alleged �freeman� have to do.\n\nIs it not slanderous to use the word �FREEMAN� is it not profiling and discrimination?\n\nI told a person who had to appear at discovery for tax court to discuss the slander only and when this was discussed your brave lawyers ran out of court.\n\nYou have to realize that there are disgruntle employees in all areas including the tax agencies and in your so called societies showing us the correct way to do things. \n\n The game plan is over, some us know that everything is based on basic accounting and that is done through the tax agencies. Whoever is holding the hot potato which is called �income� pays the taxes so if you want to collect from us, and then we shall claim. The tax agencies just want to know who received the funds. This is not old news; it�s just that we know how to properly file our accounting properly now.\n\nThat is what is coming to light. Why should the truth be known by only a select elite few?\n\nIt�s not no more.\n\nThe ironic part is that after you have received your proper tax numbers for tax filing, you can go down to STAPLES and get approved software to file to the CRA for a refund at your favorite lawyers expense.\n\n \n\nCheck mate",
