Bank of Montreal, [1978] 1 SCR 1148, where in the judgment of Laskin C.J. : [Page 1156]\n�As I have already noted, a promissory note, by definition, involves an unconditional promise to pay a sum certain in money, but it is not itself money. True, the obligation of a promissory note may be carried forward by a renewal note, but no matter how many renewals there be, or how many replacements under different terms, there is no liquidation of the debt until it is discharged, and this may be by money or money�s worth or the debt may be forgiven.�\n   Now what I do know, is that all of this has to do together with Order-in-Council No. 16, April 10, 1933, then House Joint Resolution � 192, June 5, 1933� then in the absence of gold and silver, we were given Federal Reserve/Bank of Canada-notes to use in order to still, not pay, but �buy� things with... but under section 2. of the Bills of Exchange Act  a  �note� means promissory note � it�s the same as an I.O.U., it�s a debt-instrument... section 57. (1) of the Bills of Exchange Act - Every party whose signature appears on a bill is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, deemed to have become a party thereto for value... under section 2. of the Bills of Exchange Act - �value� means valuable consideration... then there�s  the Fractional Reserve Lending System, where the rate/ratio is apparently 10 in the U.S. ... the Fractional Reserve Lending System rate/ratio/multiplier in Canada which goes by the name of the Capital Adequacy Requirement which is 20, but with approval from The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada, can be expanded to no greater than 23� the Birth-Certificate that has a water-mark  and feels like bond-paper because it�s a Bond that reads Canadian Bank Note Company Limited in teeny-weeny letters on the bottom of it with a big-red-CUSIP-number that also used to say on the back �Revenue Receipt, (the CUSIP-number), for Treasury use only�... a Social Insurance Number that looks like an account-number, on a Social Insurance Card that looks like a bank-card � so all this being said��\n   As the Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justice at the time Bora Laskin highlighted above; please provide for me Full-Disclosure on how I go about then getting refunded and/or reimbursed for the receipts I�ve accumulated from having to use legal tender in lieu of NOBODY out there complying for me and/or being familiar with how debt is to be properly liquidated by being discharged.\nThank you, and Happy belated-St. Patricks Day to all of you in your office!\nBy:___________________________NON ASSUMPSIT, WITHOUT PREJUDICE, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\nDerek Moran, Grantor, sole-living-Beneficiary, Lawful-Holder-In-Due-Course, de jure pro domino",
