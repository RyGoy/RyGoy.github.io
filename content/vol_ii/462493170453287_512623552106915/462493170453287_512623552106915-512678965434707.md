   "message": "Not yet, but another piece of the puzzle...\n\nMy quandary in this process is how to enforce a default judgement/ex parte order eg: get the sheriffs involved to seize property at the place of business of the defaulted party or some other method...\n\nUsing this process, the lien/judgement can just be on sold to a third party/financial institution (at 30% discount for example or some other agreed upon value), I take the cash & they can enforce it how they see fit as holder in due course.\n\nI want to be sure I have the pieces in place before I jump",
