   "message": "Absolutely, if it's a credit card agreement from 5 years ago, or an old mortgage from 10 years ago that I didn't even realise I had rights to, then any return is a bonus...\n\nThrow the banks a bone so they can do the leg work & offer a 30-50% discount off face value...Put in the notice to the defaulting party that every minute overdue from 30 days after the initial bill will accrue a $1/ï¿½1 charge for refusing to release my property (negotiable instrument/credit agreement/promissory note), 30 days amounts to an extra $43200.00.  That offsets any discount offered to the banks buying the note.\n\nI have worked in relatively poor communities where there are people constantly receiving threats from debt collectors, having their wages garnished, property seized etc...it's about time the tables got turned back in favour of the little guy :-)",
