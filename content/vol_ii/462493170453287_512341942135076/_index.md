   "message": "Something i came across while researching some warrants....\n\nBOE Act\n\nCrossing dividend warrants\n\n7. The provisions of this Act relating to crossed cheques apply to a warrant for payment of dividend.\n\nCCoC\n\n�valuable security� includes\n\n(a) an order, exchequer acquittance or other security that entitles or evidences the title of any person\n\n(i) to a share or interest in a public stock or fund or in any fund of a body corporate, company or society, or\n\n(ii) to a deposit in a financial institution,\n\n(b) any debenture, deed, bond, bill, note, warrant, order or other security for money or for payment of money,\n\n(c) a document of title to lands or goods wherever situated,\n\n(d) a stamp or writing that secures or evidences title to or an interest in a chattel personal, or that evidences delivery of a chattel personal, and\n\n(e) a release, receipt, discharge or other instrument evidencing payment of money;\n\nWarrant by definition is a seizure.\n\nIt would lead me to believe that a warrant is to seize the bond...Just satisfy the obligation?",
