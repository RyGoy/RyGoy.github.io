   "message": "You may be right in what ever dictatorship you live in -  but your comment about the 'FREEMAN SHIT' doesn't apply in other corporations around the world if done correctly - thats the problem with humans they all think they know a better way of doing something without listening to others, I've used the Freeman shit and have both refused a judges jurisdiction over the \"man\" and filed notices to gov etc - there are many ways to beat these bastards and if you combine them all into a package its like going at them with a machine gun instead of a bow and arrow, use their laws, processes against them and also refuse their control over the STRAWMAN and you might be surprised what effect it has. A blanket bullshit statement like yours helps no one......",
