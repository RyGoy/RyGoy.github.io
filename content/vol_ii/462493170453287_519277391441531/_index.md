   "message": "Is anyone else noticing how scary local radio is becoming? My (very) Significant Other and I both like Classic Rock, so in our home the radio is ALWAYS on and tuned to Toronto's Q107. And over the past month I've noticed a change in the advertisements. \n\nFirst, it was THIS one: http://whyiwenttolawschool.ca/Home.aspx\nThese \"heartwarming\" and \"feel-good\" stories from local lawyers around Ontario, explaining their motivations for becoming lawyers. Things like \"witnessing injustices in the neighborhood and wanting to make a difference\" and other such nonsense. \n\nNext, was the ad for MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers): http://www.madd.ca/madd2/en/services/awareness_campaigns_campaign_911.html\nWhich now, rather than promoting NOT drinking and driving, they're just pushing for people to call 911 if they SUSPECT they've seen someone ELSE driving while impaired. (Is it just me, or does that sound like the police have just given themselves permission to pull ANYONE over, ANY time they want, by just having an anonymous call made \"reporting\" you?!) \n\nAnd now, it's THIS: https://reporting.bsa.org/r/report/add.aspx?src=us&ln=en-us\npushing the promise of HUGE (potential) cash rewards for the anonymous reporting of Pirated Software! (Sure, cuz CLEARLY this is currently the greatest threat to public safety and should be of the utmost priority!)",
