   "message": "What you've noticed is good reason NOT to have the radio blaring away in the background your whole day. Pirate the music and listen to it separately without the programming. Then again, the music itself is programming, so you have to know exactly what you're listening to. Not just what the music is saying, but the rhythm and frequency you are listening to as well are constantly programming you, whether you realize it or not. Did you ever notice how the music changed over the years? Do you know what musical theory is? Did you know everything is just frequency and vibration? You thought they were just singing for fun? Haha....think again. �If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.� - Nikola Tesla That's all I'm saying about that.",
