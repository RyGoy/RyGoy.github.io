I giot lots of those...stories.\n\nAnd I know SOME of you think shit when Scott talks about kick-a-cop day, or think its funny. I dont. Its no joke...we need to start punting cops in their faces.\n\nI probably by FAR have the most experience and dealings with the cops in this group...kidnapping? thats an everyday thing with them fucks.\n\nAnd oh yeah... why whine when ya cant make a better solution, right. Well thats the solution. We gotta start doing to them what they do to us. In fact, no. Lets leave them alone. The Cop got a kid? Ill go kick his kid in the face. And his fucking dog too. What, you think itd any different when they fuck with us..and next OUR kids. \nIts really easy. See the next cop that fucks with you? Find out who he is and where he lives. And where his kids go to school. \nI follow the \"Last of the Mohicans\" edict, not the \"Kill Bill\"...I dont let offspring off.\nCuz...this is war, a war I dont want, because if it gets crazy...well Ill be the King of that shit.",
