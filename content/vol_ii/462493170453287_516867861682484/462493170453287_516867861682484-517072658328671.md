Here let me show you:\n\n\"I refer to the general workforce, there is always few exceptions.\" - NO, there are not. All clueless parasites. No other kind can function in such an environment.\n\n\" Scott, its mainly to account for all the things that i cant think of.\" - There is nothing to \"think of\" and the only reason you would, is to create imaginary \"exceptions\".\n\nThese exceptions imply that there are \"non bad\" people? Really?\n\nAfter 1933, government slowly stopped serving, and started RULING. There are no \"good\" rapists, and there are no \"good people in government.",
