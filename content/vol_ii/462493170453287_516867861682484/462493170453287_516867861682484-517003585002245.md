   "message": "anyhow...ok. quit working for the government. Lets talk about that. Can you help m out here or what?\nWhat exactly do I gotta do to do this? Whats it really mean to not be a \"government employee\"? Is it more than just claiming yourself and asserting reservations? How is one to LIVE as a non-employee? How is one to travel, work, eat, have a home? What taxes are we obliged to really pay?And fyi? I kinda like it when people HERE answer me...in their own words, and NOT by quoting Scott or pasting links.\nCuz, its all well and goo to SAY:\n PUBLIC NOTICE THAT I JOHN FRISBEY HAVE QUIT WORKING FOR YOU THE GOVERNMENT\n\nBut...whats that really MEAN? And...how does one LIVE by that?\n\nAnd ah, thanks Pete! Thats what I thought it might be about...kidnapping. Ive been there as I mentioned earlier...hence my interest HERE. And why I dont wanna get off topic like saying Adams a traitor or the wack of shit since deleted.",
