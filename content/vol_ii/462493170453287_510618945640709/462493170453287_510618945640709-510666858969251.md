   "message": "Scott,  with all of the VALUABLE information that you have shared with me/us that has made me ultimately better off for it which i TRULY appreciate- with all due respect..when you tell me, \"You THINK wrong\"..it's occured to me, i have never asked you back- \"HOW then Scott, do i think wrong?\" Because i surely cant be the ONLY one on here who thinks wrong...\n\nScott..HOW, do i THINK wrong? I would LOVE to hear about HOW i think wrong, minus all the pejoratives mind you. CONSTRUCTIVE criticism is welcomed here!\n\n..im guessing one of the points you're going to use is that- \"You should all take a course on HOW to program a computer.\" That IS on my bucket-list..\n\n*mainlines another line of Heroin*",
