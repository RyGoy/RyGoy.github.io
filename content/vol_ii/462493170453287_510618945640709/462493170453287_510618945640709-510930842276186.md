   "message": "tom again: also any profit by a public corp. ie telus, bc hydro, etc. a fractional % of profit is and has been owed to the creditor, are these also ways of validating a lien.  Also, for future moneys to be owed to the creditor, one could forcast  a $number based on the above for the years to come in ones life.  I would like to able to understand and explain to an accountant, as i suspect they will have issues putting this on the books, or is one obligated to keep books for the corporation holding the lien on the person?",
