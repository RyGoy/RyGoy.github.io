   "message": "The word \"marriage\" derives from Middle English mariage, which first appears in 1250ï¿½1300 CE This in turn is derived from Old French marier (to marry) and ultimately Latin mar?t?re meaning to provide with a husband or wife and mar?t?ri meaning to get married. The adjective mar?t-us -a, -um meaning matrimonial or nuptial could also be used in the masculine form as a noun for \"husband\" and in the feminine form for \"wife.\"[11] The related word \"matrimony\" derives from the Old French word matremoine which appears around 1300 CE and ultimately derives from Latin m?trim?nium which combines the two concepts mater meaning \"mother\" and the suffix -monium signifying \"action, state, or condition.\"",
