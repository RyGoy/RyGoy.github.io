   "message": "One more word To add to ones knowledge and personal vocab database:\n\n\"grant\" legal definition\n\nA transaction in which a grantor transfers a subset of his or her own rights in property; the rights so transferred.To transfer rights in real or personal property; in litigation, accession by the court to a partyï¿½s request made by motion or pleading.\n\nContract:\n\" A contract is an agreement having a lawful object entered into voluntarily by two or more parties, each of whom intends to create one or more legal obligations between or among them. The elements of a contract are \"offer\" and \"acceptance\" by \"competent persons\" having legal capacity who exchange \"consideration\" to create \"mutuality of obligation.\" Proof of some or all of these elements may be done in writing, though contracts may be made entirely orally or by conduct. The remedy for breach of contract can be \"damages\" in the form of compensation of money or specific performance enforced through an injunction. Both of these remedies award the party at loss the \"benefit of the bargain\" or expectation damages, which are greater than mere reliance damages, as in promissory estoppel. The parties may be natural persons or juristic persons. A contract is a legally enforceable promise or undertaking that something will or will not occur. The word promise can be used as a legal synonym for contract, although care is required as a promise may not have the full standing of a contract, as when it is an agreement without consideration.\"\n\nI'm sure you all know this stuff...but...just in case...\nAnd refreshes are always good since there is so much to learn and know.\nI do know....words, how they are used, and the paper they are printed on? \nPowerful stuff...more deadly than any firearm",
