   "message": "Habeas Corpus\nby Shawn Ofthefamily Folkes \n\nFYI:\n\nThe writ of habeas corpus is one of what are called the \"extraordinary\", \"common law\", or \"prerogative writs\", which were historically issued by the English courts in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are quo warranto, prohibito, mandamus, procedendo, and certiorari. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.\n\nAlso... Pay attention to these writs in particular:\n\nQuo warranto (Medieval Latin for \"by what warrant?\") is a prerogative writ requiring the person to whom it is directed to show what authority they have for exercising some right or power (or \"franchise\") they claim to hold.\n\nA writ of prohibition is a writ directing a subordinate to stop doing something the law prohibits. In practice, the Court directs the Clerk to issue the Writ, and directs the Sheriff to serve it on the subordinate, and the Clerk prepares the Writ and gives it to the Sheriff, who serves it. This writ is normally issued by a superior court to the lower court asking it not to proceed with a case which does not fall under its jurisdiction.These Writs are issued as \"alternative\" or \"peremptory.\" An alternative Writ directs the recipient to immediately act, or desist, and \"Show Cause\" why the directive should not be made permanent. A peremptory Writ directs the recipient to immediately act, or desist, and \"return\" the Writ, with certification of its compliance, within a certain time.When an agency of an official body is the target of the Writ of Prohibition, the Writ is directed to the official body over which the court has direct jurisdiction, ordering the official body to cause the agency to desist.Although the rest of this article speaks to judicial processes, a writ of prohibition may be directed by any court of record (i.e., higher than a misdemeanor court) toward any official body, whether a court or a county, city or town government, that is within the court's jurisdiction.\n\nMandamus is a judicial remedy which is in the form of an order from a superior court to any government subordinate court, corporation or public authority to do or forbear from doing some specific act which that body is obliged under law to do or refrain from doing, as the case may be, and which is in the nature of public duty and in certain cases of a statutory duty. It cannot be issued to compel an authority to do something against statutory provision. For example, it cannot be used to force a lower court to reject or authorize applications that have been made, but if the court refuses to rule one way or the other then a mandamus can be used to order the court to rule on the applications.Mandamus may be a command to do an administrative action or not to take a particular action, and it is supplemented by legal rights. In the American legal system it must be a judicially enforceable and legally protected right before one suffering a grievance can ask for a mandamus. A person can be said to be aggrieved only when he is denied a legal right by someone who has a legal duty to do something and abstains from doing.\n\n Interesting terms one should also familiarize oneself with these as well:\n\n    aggrieve[ uh-greev ]verb (used with object) ag�grieved, ag�griev�ing.1. to oppress or wrong grievously; injure by injustice.2. to afflict with pain, anxiety, etc.\n\n    Franchise[ fran-chahyz ]noun1. a privilege of a public nature conferred on an individual, group, or company by a government: a franchise to operate a bus system.2. the right or license granted by a company to an individual or group to market its products or services in a specific territory.3. a store, restaurant, or other business operating under such a license.4. the territory over which such a license extends.5. the right to vote: to guarantee the franchise of every citizen.6. a privilege arising from the grant of a sovereign or government, or from prescription, which presupposes a grant.7. a player of great talent or popular appeal, considered vitally important to a team's success or future.8. a legal immunity or exemption from a particular burden, exaction, or the like.9. freedom, especially from imprisonment, servitude, or moral restraint.",
