   "message": "Quo warranto (Medieval Latin for \"by what warrant?\") is a prerogative writ requiring the person to whom it is directed to show what authority they have for exercising some right or power (or \"franchise\") they claim to hold. **On my to do list is getting a major rehaul of the CFSA and the abolishment of the NS Civil Forfeiture Act. the civil forfeiture act is the same process as for getting custody of your kids but only they take your money and get the judge to give custody of the money to the NS.Gov., I wanted to know under what authority this law got approved for use.    I could go to court and prove the law is illegal or I could get the judge to order Quo warranto and let the administrator prove why it should stand. Is this a correct understanding of  Quo warranto  .",
