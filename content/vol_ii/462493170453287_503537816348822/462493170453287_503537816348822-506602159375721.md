   "message": "There is no room/time for conversations. I'm TRYING to keep you out of prison camps.\n\nMake conversation on your own time. I CAN'T forgive not actually reading what I type. It hurts to dumb myself down as it is. Seriously. It hurts. It's crippling, and restrictive, and unbearable in its lack of precision.\n\nI get called names by adults with imaginary friends, and am branded \"crazy\" whenever your petrified little minds can't grasp something.\n\nI really do hate you all. You shit on my Grandparent's legacy, because you were all too stupid to see what is really important, and will believe anything you are told... then you accept that \"Belief=Truth\".\n\n...and then you ask me to \"forgive your ignorance\". I won't, and i claim the right not to. YOU are why I will be killed in some made-up event, and called a \"terrorist\". Your ignorance allowed the cash collectors to take over.\n\n...so, no. I don't \"forgive your ignorance\". Your ignorance is what WILL kill me.",
