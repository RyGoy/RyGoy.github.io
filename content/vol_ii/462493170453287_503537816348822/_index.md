   "message": "Judge Dale says utilities, insurance, etc is already paid via our BC Trust:\n\nYou may receive a monthly statement from a Mortgage Company; Loan Company or Utility Company, which usually has already been paid by the TRUST.  Almost all of these corporate businesses double dip and hope that you have been conditioned well enough by their Credit Scams, to pay them a second time.  Instead of paying that Statement next time, sign it approved and mail it back to them.  If they then contact you about payment, ask them to send you a TRUE BILL instead of a Statement and you will be glad to pay it?  A Statement documents what was due and paid, whereas a TRUE BILL represents only what is due.  Banks and Utility Companies have direct access into these Cesta Que Trusts and all they needed was your name; social security number and signature.\n\nHow do you prove this?",
