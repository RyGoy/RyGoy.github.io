   "message": "I don't have my original application, that got spirited away, but I wrote a letter like this, attached to my bill:\n\nOn or about 7 May 2004, I signed a valuable security, with face value �XXXXXX.00 and deposited same to you, creating a trust and or credit relationship, in which you impliedly or explicitly agreed to act as trustee and or deposit my creditor�s deposit/valuable security accordingly.\nAt or around the time of me entrusting this valuable security to you, you opened a customer account, Account number \nYYYYYYYYYY.   The security offered by the customer as collateral in relation to this account was the property known as (address of property).  \n\nIt is my understanding that, as of 1 September 2010, this customer account has since been settled and or discharged and or closed, thus ending any business relationship between you and the customer.  However, at the end of this business relationship between you and the customer, the original valuable security has not been returned to me.\nConsequently, please find attached an invoice for �XXXXXX0.00, being the face value of the valuable security deposited to you on or about 7 May 2004.\nAs per the instructions in the invoice, please deposit said amount into the nominated account by cheque or electronic funds transfer, within 30 days of the date of the invoice...\n\nAs the saying goes:\nSend them a bill\nSend them a statement\nSend them a fault & default notice\nGet an ex parte order against them\n\nAnd the missing bit....Kaching!!\n\nI've sent the bill....and will let you know how the rest of the process goes :-)",
