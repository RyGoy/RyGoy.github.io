   "message": "I'm currently looking into that Chad Brodgesell, because with my application/credit agreement/Bill of Exchange, (and as far as I can tell, this holds true for most/all credit agreements) I signed a power of attorney for the lending institution, which is what enables them to create a promissory note using my signature & filling in the details (Bills of Exchange Act Inchoate instrument).\n\nThis is the step in the process that enables the institution to act as a trustee on behalf of the credit provider (you act in this capacity when you sign the original application) & lend to you in the role as customer when you sign the loan agreement.\n\nSearching through my own mortgage agreements, every term such as grantor, lender, customer, trustee etc are all defined, but the one term mentioned but not defined, is the credit provider....and they sidestep answering that question.",
