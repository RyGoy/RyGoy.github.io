   "message": "Chances are the \"\" Application \"\" is not as the GRANTEE but rather the GRANTOR. The approve your Full Faith and Credit and convert it to those Digital or plastic bills then tell you that you have been approved for the loan which is PRINCIPLE and INTEREST  plus some timed addition fees.\nNow you always deal with them as the GRANTEE showing up with the papers of the GRANTEE. But you never show up as the GRANTOR and ORIGINAL documentation to collect YOUR PRINCIPAL that has been converted and given back to the bank to return to the GRANTOR minus the INTEREST and other fees. The bank is there to CONVERT your Full Faith and Credit into some thing that an be used. They keep the PRINCIPAL since the GRANTOR has not claimed it.\n\nHave you EVER noticed that they ALWAYS want the Interest first? It's like they don't even care about the PRINCIPAL.\n\nThis is MY understanding of how it works. There are SOME occasions where OTHER peoples real money is used in which case you really ARE borrowing from some one else though.\nThis is just my understanding.",
