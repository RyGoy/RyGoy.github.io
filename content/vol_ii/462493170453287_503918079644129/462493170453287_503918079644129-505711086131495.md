   "message": "Adam Thomas... Buddy, why in opposition? Philip Laforet has the right idea. When dealing with issues of sovereignty, becomming free of the oligarchal enemy, then all information is valid.

There is no particularly good information and no bad information. just information, which, until it is validated and tested, will avail us all to seek our true goal... to be free ourselves, and assist those who also wish to attain that goal.",
