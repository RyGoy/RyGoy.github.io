   "message": "Geez, where are you Northern Hemisphere guys n gals at? Have any of you tried putting things together from Robert Menard's work on this. Your NAME is not a Corporation. The government treats your all  caps fictional entity as a corporate entity in process only. This is how they attempt to get you to admit a joiner with your all caps and upper and lower case entities. The point is to make you the trustee and not the beneficiary in your government operated 'situs trust'. remember, in any trust its always the Trustee who pays. They want YOU to pay. Here in NZ we have a guy named Bill Turner who teaches different ways of achieving the same ends which is a little different to the Freeman on the Land mode. please check his Youtube videos... search youtube for Bill Turner New Zealand, he has approx 11 video's there.",
