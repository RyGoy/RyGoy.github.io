   "message": "I got another letter from the Dept. of Justice today, (We have quite the relationship going on, this is the 4th letter that I have received from them, one was even registered mail, telling me that my process of sending affidavits to social workers at their office was not proper procedure.) Any ways todays letter was about my Notice of Understanding and claim of right. It was short and sweet and to the point. \"Be advised that the Attorney General of Nova Scotia does not accept your notice of understanding as set out in your letter of March 18, 2013. That's too bad because it has already been defaulted.",
