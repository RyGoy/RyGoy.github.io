   "message": "I got a \"no such claim known to law\" I defaulted & then sent a letter explaining contract made the law & they had already missed their opportunity to disclose. they are holding presumptions over me through an army pension (earned & contributed to) they claim they'll stop payments because new legislation requires me to have a bank account. would Notice of Mistake suffice & ask how they intend remedy,what do you think scott?",
