Your NOTICE is an OFFER.\n\nLet's look at a simple NO PARKING notice. They are giving you NOTICE NOT to park there, with a notice of what you pay if you DO park there. That's the conditions of NO PARKING. If you don't accept those conditions, don't park there... it's just notice.\n\nSame with your NOTICE. They don't ACCEPT THE TERMS. It MAY mean they intend to leave you alone.",
