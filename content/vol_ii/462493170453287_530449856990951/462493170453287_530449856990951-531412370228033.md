   "message": "well, first you get them in default for the proof in commerce that YOU have more of a right to somthing than whomever it is that has it, and then you publish the lein by notary and apostile, and have the sherrif serve them with a collection of said property, if that property is 'dollars', then those are transfereed between accounts, so it is much easier to try to sell the lien at a loss to a bank or insurance company by using the old tried and true method of entrapment by greed.\n\nyou offer someone who gets 10% a deal that net's them a years pay and they will greedily do their best to accomodate your offer.\n\ni have a lein against a party for 1680 ounces of gold, you can have 10% of the 25% i will give your company in discount (additionally out of my own pocket) if you get your company to buy the lein from me.",
