   "message": "when you cant get him to produce the gold, you have a way to lein everything he owns of value in collection. sort of like an inverted bankruptcy, instead of that party claiming bankruptcy, you cause it to happen by lawfully taking physical posession of everything you can. if it is only on paper, you try trading that to a bank or other institution that trades paper notes.\n\nthe ultimate goal is to have it go into somewhare that you have access to being able to convert it form a note into physical silver/gold, because then you can claim it got lost at sea.",
