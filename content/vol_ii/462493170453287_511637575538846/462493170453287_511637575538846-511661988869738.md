   "message": "wow, interesting, I went to a court house the other day and read a notice posted on the door into the court room. The notice stated (paraphrasing of course) The court must make sure everything is understood before \"moving forward\". Next time I am there I will read it again and ask to photograph it (or not ask) Then we can send him the NOTICE of understanding. Apparently he wasn't informed of this prior to hearing you (or should I say not hearing you).",
