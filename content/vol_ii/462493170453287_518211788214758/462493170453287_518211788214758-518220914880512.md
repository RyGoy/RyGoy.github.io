   "message": "They are trained to say that to cover their asses when recordings come up of them beating the crap out of someone. because there is no way to prove or disprove whether someone is resisting whilst being held down. only the guy holding him knows. Also by punching someone in the face you are assured they will try and roll over to protect themselves from the blows and in turn the officer claims that as resisting in order to continue beating on your. the psychology is rather simple and supports the psychopathy of the office.",
