   "message": "I get it Beverly. Here's my point/conundrum: I think it was chief Rock, if I recall correctly,who essentially stated what Eamonn said. He (if I have the correct reference) added that because it is ONLY evidence of a SECURITY/FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, we are committing FRAUD if we use it as IDENTIFICATION. As Scott said, it's not IDENTIFICATION. We ought never to use it as such.Yet, be that as it is,  I've yet to be asked for my SECURITY/FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, to establish a bank account, or to deal with the government etc. They always ask for IDENTIFICATION and tell me that acceptable and recognized IDENTIFICATION INCLUDES my BIRTH CERTIFICATE ETC. What do I offer instead?",
