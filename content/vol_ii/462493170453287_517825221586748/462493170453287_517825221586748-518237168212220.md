   "message": "Again Beverly, I get it. I've yet to be asked for my SECURITY/FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. I'm ALWAYS asked for MY  IDENTIFICATION. If I Provide my BC in response to that request, am I not committing FRAUD. Perhaps not last year when I didn't have a clue (lack of intent to commit FRAUD) I was innocent of FRAUD, but now that I know, if I hand over their BC, NOW I'm committing FRAUD because now I know it's not my IDENTIFICATION. Am I unclear in what I'm saying or am I missing something here?",
