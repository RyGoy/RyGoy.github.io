   "message": "Two things strike me as funny with the OHIP card.  The first is that we were told we needed to start \"renewing\" the card which can be used as photo ID in a number of places excluding Ontario.  The second thing is that if you didn't buy into the renewal process, nothing happened.  You can still use the original card.",
