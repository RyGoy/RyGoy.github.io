   "message": "I don't know about you kids, but, I read posts by both Tara and Scott some time ago strongly suggesting it is of paramount importance to these endeavours, and to each of our individual \"banishment resistance powers\"; for us to remain focused. To state the obvious, Scott may do as he pleases as this is his place. Go Scott go!I must concurr with Scott's and Tara's sentiment that it is less than inspiring to increasingly realize that it is common here to witness threads turn  from a topic dealing with THE TENDER FOR LAW, into a thread about Mars and Bruce Willis. Please stop distracting Scott's mind. I'm here to learn. Thanks for tolerating my pleas.I had to rant! Oops, I just broke the rule by not staying on topic. I hope I'm not in trouble.",
