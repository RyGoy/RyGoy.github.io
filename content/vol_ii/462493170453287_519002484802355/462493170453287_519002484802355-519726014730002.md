   "message": "And my all time personal favourite, which blows the whole \"child support\" theory out of the water as being nothing more than about government profit and totally irrelevant of the essential needs of a child is that for some reason, the \"needs\" of the child of a wealthy father demand far more money than that of the child of a father making minimum wage.  Would one of you child support advocates please explain to me how the essential needs of the child of a doctor are greater than that of a father working at Walmart.  It's bloody hilarious and so transparent as to what the true purpose of \"child support\" is.",
