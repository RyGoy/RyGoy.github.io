   "message": "Cara Small Atherton, no need to get defensive, I only asked you questions for the most part, did I not?  Was it not you that communicated those terms to me?  If you did not want it to be my business (or that of the groups) then why did you employ them in your commuciations?  What specifically are your childrens' rights you claim to be protecting?  Do you think than perhaps the rights of the child and that of parent may be related?  But I do maintain my postion, which was not a questions, that money is not a necessity to maintain human life. In reference to yourself, you state, \"I am\" and rebut being a  person of statute.  Do you rely on statutory promulgated benefits/privileges such as child \"support\", \"custody\" and/or \"access\" to procure benefits/privileges in the matter?  If you do, how could you reasonably rebut not being a person of statute?  Just some food for thought.  I wish all the best for you, your children,  and their father.",
