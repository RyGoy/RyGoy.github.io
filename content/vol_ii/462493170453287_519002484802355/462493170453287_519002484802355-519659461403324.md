   "message": "I raised twin daughters from 1 & half years old & we never heard from their mom. I wasn't even allowed to file for support of any kind. Then about 15 years later my son's mom ran out on us when he was 5 months old & he never met her. He will be 24 soon & has about 7 years in the Navy now. The twins are 38 now.",
