   "message": "Kate of Gaia did a show about this, tying it into Trust Law. The male is the Beneficiary, the female the Trustee. Why? All the male had to do is make a 'Deposit,' he BENEFITED that way. On the other hand, the courts look at it, that the female CARRIED the baby, went into LABOUR for the baby, and DELIVERED the baby. Believe it or not, somehow Kate of Gaia tied this all into the POST OFFICE too, i just forget exactly how (it also included the, 'male box'). Regardless...the courts view the female/mother as the TRUSTEE, since, she did do all the CARRYING/DELIVERING/LABOUR, JOB as the Trustee, ie.WORK. As much as i know thats not what you wanna hear, Derek :/",
