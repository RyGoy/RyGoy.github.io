   "message": "Cara Small Atherton If you were never taught that you had a right not to be held in servitude or slavery, and in fact were intentionally led to believe quite to contrary, would you feel bound to honour the terms of a contract you had been coerced to enter into under fraudulent misrepresentation?  Please stop and think about it for a moment, perhaps on a more global level.  I AM NOT your adversary.  You came to a site like this for a reason, did you not?  Ignorance of the law is no excuse.
