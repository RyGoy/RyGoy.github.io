   "message": "One thing I can say about split parenting, since its been 14 years since my kids' father \"went away.\" I NEVER, EVER denied him access to those kids. I do not agree with the way he lives and didn't particularly want the kids to 'learn' any of his bad traits but WHO THE HELL AM I to decide? It is not my right to tell him what and how to teach those kids! I can only teach them to be smart and listen to themselves and they will decide on their own what's true or not. So Derek, you have no right to tell her that you don't want your son learning a religion or ANYTHING that she might feel is something she would like to pass on to this child. I think if you are going to DISRESPECT her, she will fight ï¿½only to prove to herself you are an asshole and that she's right. All of you fighting for access to a child, for shit's sake, try to be nice! That will get you much further. She IS still the mother, whether you like her or not and you have another 16ish years of dealing with her regardless.",
