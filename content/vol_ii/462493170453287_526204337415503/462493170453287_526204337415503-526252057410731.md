   "message": "Is agreeing to a peace bond the same thing as pleading guilty?\n\nNo. A person does not plead guilty when they enter into a peace bond. There is no finding of guilt made or conviction registered if a person agrees to a peace bond.\n\nOne of the reasons why a person may agree to enter a peace bond is to avoid a criminal record.\n\nWhile a peace bond is still in effect it will appear in a criminal record check. After the peace bond has expired, it should not be visible in a criminal record check. However, there are certain types of criminal record searches, such as something called a �vulnerable person check� where a peace bond will still show up even after it has expired.\n\nhttp://lawfacts.ca/node/16",
