   "message": "Scott made a big deal about grammar though.\n\ni stated the truth thats it? Sorry if my negativity gets to you.\n\nYou've been doing liens since you were born? According to your profile it states you were born 1963. That would make you 50 today....\n\nWho knows what Scott is doing. But Scott stated that you shouldn't even be going to court, here you are going to court and got a trial set up. Completely negating your notice of mistake as trials are held for people who fall under jurisdiction. That can only be established if the accused is present and surety. Otherwise they would stay the proceedings. Hey guess what you keep presenting yourself so clearly you don't understand the meaning of that notice.\n\nIf i were a justice, I'd rail road you and call all your bluffs because from what i gathered you really don't know what you are doing. But oh well.",
