   "message": "Derek Hill, you were the one who first suggested a lien on the charges and I thank you for that. Now that I have learned how easy it is to do. just the mention of it puts fear of God into people's hearts.  So, if you do understand the lien process, no bond, no job, no law licence, no job! There was a video on you tube where these 4 cops went to this guys home in southern California, for some reason or another, he told them about a lien, they scattered.  I will try to find it and post it.",
