   "message": "Not showing up, will only get you arrested!! I have been in and out of court, civil, family and criminal for the last 20 years or so, I am rather comfortable with them, I haven't any fear.  As I have stated, there is more than one way to skin a cat.  If we are not to show up, why then the point of order? I think my grammar is fine, I have more of a problem with people discussing their sex lives in this forum more than I have a problem with grammar!!  Also showing up, have things put over making new dates etc, costs the system money, sooner or later, they'll go broke!!  Sometimes the truth is just a perception.",
