   "message": "So I just got back from court, was to be a trial.  They brought a justice in from out of town.  Did the point of order, notice of mistake, he said he didn't understand, I said he was incompetent, he  didn't seem to mind.Asked him to recuse himself, he just kept rolling on.  I would not stand nor sit or be quiet when told.  The took a few recesses, the crown kept running to and from his office.  I settled for a peace bond, it was an easy way out the charge was dismissed or withdrawn.  Anyway there was a reporter there as usual when I do anything.  She was working on a larger story in regards to the recent happenings in courts.  I referred her to the King. (hope you don't mind Scott) There is no such thing as bad press!! (as long as they spell your name right!!)",
