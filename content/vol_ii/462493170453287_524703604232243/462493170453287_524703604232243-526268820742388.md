   "message": "^ Eugene Forsey said of this: \"in Canada, the head of state can, in exceptional circumstances, protect Parliament and the people against a Prime Minister and Ministers who may forget that 'minister' means 'servant', and may try to make themselves masters. For example, the head of state could refuse to let a Cabinet dissolve a newly elected House of Commons before it could even meet, or could refuse to let Ministers bludgeon the people into submission by a continuous series of general elections,\"[10] and Larry Zolf commented: \"The Governor General must take all steps necessary to thwart the will of a ruthless prime minister prematurely calling for the death of a Parliament.\"[11] Examples of such actions took place during the viceregal service of the Viscount Byng of Vimy, John C. Bowen,[12] and Frank Lindsay Bastedo.[13]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Privy_Council_for_Canada",
