   "message": "Joel Kinmond:\n This: Go here and read Section 2: http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html\nThen read Note 3: Section 2, repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act, 1893, 56-57 Vict., c. 14 (U.K.), read as follows:\n2. The Provisions of this Act referring to Her Majesty the Queen extend also to the Heirs and Successors of Her Majesty,\nKings and Queens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nQueen Victoria, the reigning Queen in 1893 died in 1901. Although other sections of the BNA Act\nstipulate powers of Her Majesty, without the provisions that were deleted in Section 2, it would\nseem obvious that such powers died with Queen Victoria.\n\nIn 1998, the Statute Revision Act of 1893 was rescinded by the British Parliament, but rescinding\nan old Act of Parliament doesn't re-establish an erased statute, or part of one, especially since the\nStatute of Westminster of 1931 nullified any further British statutes having any authority over Canada.\nA school blackboard erased in 1893 does not have that which was erased re-appear because the eraser\nwas thrown in the garbage in 1998.",
