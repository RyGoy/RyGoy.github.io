   "message": "Scott on THE QUEEN's role in Canada. . . . .\n\nScott Duncan: Do you know what The Queen's role in this is? ( This should be good )\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: Queen's role in our BC's? Or going to jail?\n\nScott Duncan: Queen Going to Jail. Why? - I can make it happen tomorrow. There are methods to do just that. What is her crime?\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: She authorized government to do whatever they want?\n\nScott Duncan: No dear. YOU did,\n\nScott Duncan: She's the KEEPER OF THE TRUST. She HAS TO OBEY ORDERS FROM THE TRUSTEES!\n\nJoel Kinmond: Keeper same as Custodian? YES\n\nScott Duncan: If she didn't, she'd be executed.\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: Well then why can't I write her a letter to toss Harper out?\n\nScott Duncan: Same with the speaker of the House.\n\n...and yes it's happened.\n\nScott Duncan: Imagine being BORN into that. They have NO money. NOT ONE CENT. It's all in the trust.\n\nJoel Kinmond: It seems for something ( A TRUST ) that is supposed to have 3 \"positions\" admin / beneficary /trustee. So the KEEPER is Grantor or Admin? I am getting caught up with terms.\n\nScott Duncan: Toss harper out... What would that do? The next Party member in line replaces him. There isn't even an election!\n\nHarper is JUST THE PARTY LEADER. He has no power and \"Harper\" didn't do all this. He's just the mouthpiece in the House Of Commons who speaks for the Party!\n\nJoel Kinmond: But TRUSTEE are supposed to take orders from the ADMINSTRATOR? No wonder people are so confused. No HOMONYMNS - Just a million definitions!\n\nRuss Rawlingson: Treason, thats the Queens crime. Sold us out to the EU in the 70's. I was christened C of E. One of the Charters in the Magna Carta that still stands says \"The state must protect the church of england\" and she has failed me big time so that's 2 crimes. Possably.\n\nScott Duncan: She is the HEAD of state. She has no more authority to do ANY of what you describe than The Governor General. Learn what that title MEANS.\n\nIf she did ANYTHING you say she failed to do, that would be treason.\n\nI think you need to study her role here. She's not the \"supreme Wealthy Leader. She is a PROP. Like Michelle Jean.\n\nMichelle Jean couldn't \"protect the church\" or any of that other shit either.\n\nScott Duncan: Joel Kinmond: YOU have it SO backwards.\n\nADMINISTRATORS ARE TRUSTEES.\n\nThe HOLDER/KEEPER ENABLES the trustees. The Keeper follows ALL legal orders of trustees. They HAVE to. THEY represent THE TRUST ITSELF as a TRUST IS NOT A PERSON.\n\nCara Small Atherton: has the queen taken on the protector of the trusts and must make sure they answer?\n\nScott Duncan: No. the keeper is just the placeholder \"person\" for the trust.",
