   "message": "There is no excuse i was dragged from my car friday night by 3 of them cuffed and assaulted for daring to ask why and under what authority i was being stopped at 3 am outside my mothers house. Did there best to find some way of charging me with something but nothing no lawfull or legal reason given. And to top it all off tried to seize 150 pound sterling when i asked why i was told \"well there was a nothern bank robbery\" by what authority to you accuse me of the fucking northern bank robbery. These fucks are out of control and kick a cop in the face day needs to be elevated to hang a cop day in my opinion.",
