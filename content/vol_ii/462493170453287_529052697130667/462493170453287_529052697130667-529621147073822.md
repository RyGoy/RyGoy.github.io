   "message": "Yes Eamonn O Brien everything was in order hence no legal or lawful reason given there was simply no reason but they were bored it seems/ David Johansen i was also in the suburbs and these people were simply ignorant to any kind of facts of law nothing was stopping them from doing whatever they wanted. Simply put this was 3 assholes in costumes who were too use to doing whatever the fuck they want and could not for the life of them figure out how i had the audacity to question them, took great offence to being informed they were public servants and acting outside their oath of office to protect me. I have never met 3 people so stupid at the exact same time before but trust the job of a parasite to create such dangerous unquestionable assholes they are a danger to the public they swore to protect.",
