I am unable to control my thoughts and emotions, and, as such, have the right to take things personally, and to determine what people should and should not say.  I should have the right to choose what is offensive, and to \"politely suggest\" that it be removed.  Come to think of it, I find the term \"French fucktards\" offensive and I suggest David Grant not be allowed to post here.",
