   "message": "So DNS is flawed in the sense that it's functions can be regulated by governments etc... A site that I view today may be deemed inaccessible tomorrow... The creators of said site don't want potential customers like me being blocked so they may want to seek alternative, guaranteed TLD's for their customer's to access their site without interference...i.e .bit...\n\nIs the idea for our banks to exist on the .bit domain and be available for these site owners to access in order to set up alternative sites to the current TLD's?...\n\nScott :p",
