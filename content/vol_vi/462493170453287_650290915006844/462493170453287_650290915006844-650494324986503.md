   "message": "Supersede governments, supersede banks...the system will not be destroyed but replaced by providing a superior system and service that the masses flock to (supply/demand with a gentle nudge)...rendering the old system redundant...it will still exist, but if you remain there, you're a dinosaur who becomes just as redundant as they are.\n\nMove into the 'new/better' system (comply), remain in the old system (slave/victim), but you cannot exist in a vacuum because you can never be truly self sufficient, so you'll 'starve' on one or several levels.\n\nThat's my take on it Derek Hill, hope that's useful for you.",
