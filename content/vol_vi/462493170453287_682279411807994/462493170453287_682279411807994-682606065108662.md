   "message": "I know that for every man or woman that wants to put their race, or difference between races, as some thing of importance, then  those are helping to perpetuate difference between humans. If you keep bringing it up, it will always exist. \n\nThe funny thing is that in REALITY almost all humans, regardless of race, are considered SLAVES, but STILL a few humans want to act as if only THEY suffer from slavery. Slavery it is NOT exclusive of a particular race, as we come to find out in this group, and it was not \"abolished.\" \n\nI just know there is something very wrong with that self-destructive \"I am black/latino/minority, and discriminated\" stuff. It's more like an EXCUSE, than a real thing. Just sayin'.",
