   "message": "Here in reality....that birth certificate and registration of the PERSON has fucked over generations, upon generations. Is \"I am forced surety, and its' not my fault' also self-destructive? Or did it actually happen, and we are learning, through diligence and discipline, to undue the very real generational consequences of that? As angry as you are about that, I don't get how you even dare to venture an opinion into territory completely unknown to you, which, by the way, was compounded by this forced legal PERSON enslavement that has you so very riled up. You're dealing with one thing. \n\nYou mad, or nah?\n\nAnd, I promise.....don't you mention it, and I won't say another word about it.",
