If you are in the private you are not a part of their \"clubhouse\" and are not susceptible to thier rules. If anyone in here is studying the law then they should know the break down of law and what constitutes public and private and where the power lies. \n\nWe have entire shows dedicated to suing third party debt collectors and so forth. If you have any NEW information we are more than open to hear it. We are all about solutions. However a Maxim of Law states thaat \"many men know many things, no man knows everything.\"",
