   "message": "It's why we attach a NON COMMERCIAL ATTRIBUTION license to it. So nobody can LEGALLY make money off it (I'm looking at YOU, Facebook).\n\nWe are considering an OPEN COMMERCIAL license for \"THE TRUTH and ROBERT MENARD\", as it's a BOOK at this point. I figure we will distribute it in that form, and people who want to sell printed copies, can make as much as people will pay for it.",
