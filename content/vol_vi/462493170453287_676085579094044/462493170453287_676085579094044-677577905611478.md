   "message": "The great thing about a marriage is that, if the 2 are in the same boat, the government cannot do crap. The government could only interfere if a controversy among the marriage arises and cannot be solved by the couple. Then one, or both of the parties could petition for \"help\" to a \"guardian mediator\" to basically decide for them.\n\nI am beginning to see how marriage it's a stronger position (for the persons we happen to have), with more \"benefits,\" than not being married.",
