   "message": "Text 'Tard�\n\nThis one's important, so pay attention! It's primarily directed at THE TENDER FOR LAW members [ https://www.facebook.com/groups/tenderforlaw/ ], but it applies globally.\n\nText 'Tard: It's one of those things that you, the typical Reader/Free-Dumber, do because... OK, I have no fucking clue why you do it.\n\nI'm talking about the idiotic way you people write.  If you're trying to communicate to ME, and you want ACTUAL knowledge from me (which I happily provide, at no cost to you whatsoever), then perhaps you might do me the favour of at least trying to write at my level.  I have raised this issue on many occasions, and am invariably dismissed as a \"Grammar Nazi\".   This is simply untrue.  When you type like an autistic 12-year-old it is a personal attack on me.  You are in a forum that deals with LAW.  I select the words I use VERY carefully.  If you are able to write a LEGAL document, you certainly don't write it in Text 'Tard�.  This means you will do more for people who wish to harm you, and those around you, than you will for the man who's ACTUALLY GIVING YOU KNOWLEDGE!  You are communicating with ME.  Everyone else in this group is an audience.  \n\nEvery time you write in Text 'Tard� you are saying on the PUBLIC RECORD, that you care more about strangers in black dresses, in a clubhouse in which you are not a member, than you do about myself, or anyone else in this group!\n\nI get NO BENEFIT by running this forum.  NONE!  It costs me my precious time to be here.  \n\nThose of you who have been paying attention lately will notice that I instantly ban anyone who tries to justify their use of Text 'Tard�.  You'll write in proper English for a pretend \"Justice\", but you won't for a real Admiral?  Very well...\n\nIf you won't do so out of basic human decency, you will do it by force.\n\nThis is a policy I've already implemented over the past week or so; I'm just making it official. WRITE IN COMPLETE SENTENCES! USE THE PROPER WORDS, IN THE PROPER ORDER!\n\nThe autistic 12-year-old demograph is not really my target audience and I shall pander to it no more.  \n\nI hate you all.  Die.\n\nHave a nice day!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/24CQJvzmWHI",
