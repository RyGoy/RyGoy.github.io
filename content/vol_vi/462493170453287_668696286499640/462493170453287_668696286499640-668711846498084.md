   "message": "If someone is TELLING YOU THE TRUTH, they don't need \"divine authority\". They don't need to belch out weasel-word phrases like \"Proposed joint venture to streamline margin settlement processes and enhance access to collateral worldwide, improving the safety and soundness of the financial markets.\". They just need to speak.\n\nI don't possess ANY mental powers that you don't. Neither do these fraud artists. If it's real, you don't need bullshit weasel-words to explain it.",
