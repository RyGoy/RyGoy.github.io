   "message": "Well that's an hour of my life I'll never get back!\nTranscript follows:\nSovereign UnderGod:\nactually im not begging for money i was answering their questions is all...\n\nMe:\nYou posted a link to your gofundme \"campaign\"... How is that \"not begging for money\"?\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\ni was explaing why i have done all this...\nu guys asked\ni wasnt campaining\nto u\nhttp://youtu.be/D2Wjjvip-Wk\nthis is why\nu didnt let me finish explaining\n\nMe:\nIf put even the TINIEST amount of effort into investigating this group first, you would have noticed a few things. First: The name. \"The Tender for Law\" is in reference to money, and the \"legal tender\" attached to it. This group teaches you how to detach yourself from that legal tender.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nand the only reason im campaining is to raise awareness...im not expectingto get funds\nok but y\nits there for remedy for the fraud\nhttp://www.lectlaw.com/def/f111.htm\n\"Fiction Of Law\" Defined & Explained\nwww.lectlaw.com\n\nMe:\nSecond: The pinned post, and many OTHER posts, address the illogical fallacy that is religion. You're coming into the group with two strikes against you already. If you want to raise awareness, RAISE AWARENESS! Asking for money will turn away more people than it attracts. That kills your message.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nyou have no idea what religion i am\n\nMe:\nRemedy for the fraud? Remedy from who? Who are you going to take this matter to, the courts that are perpetuating the fraud?\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nno\nits administrative...i am the court\n\nMe:\nAs if it matters WHICH religion you ascribe to, they are all EQUALLY ludicrous.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nNO\nits called UCA\nUnique Collective Awareneess\ncollective conciousness\nmy friend\nmaybe u shouldt be so quik to judge\nhere http://one-heaven.org/covenant/article/8.html\nthat might explain\n\nMe:\nALL religions are bullshit. Belief of any kind, especially in a \"higher power\", or \"divine creator\" is nothing more than delusion. Adults with imaginary friends.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nits all of us....\nwhois the high power\ncollective conciousness\n\nMe:\nAhh, yes. Frank O'Collins...I'm sorry, I just can't take anything seriously that comes from a man that claims to have had visions from angels.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\njudge not lest ye be judged\n\nMe:\nFunny, the \"non-religious\" guy is now quoting the Bible...\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\noh is that bible?\n'er babble?\n500+ followers on my babble\nso far...been here a month\n\nMe:\nIt's funny, anyone who ISN'T religious would be locked up and medicated if they claimed to have an invisible, all-powerful, omniscient friend that watched over them from above. Who sent visions of winged beings to deliver messages to them, who they talked to on a regular basis and asked for personal favours. But if you attach a religious label to this insanity, suddenly it becomes socially acceptable.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\ni never claimed that at all\nu assumed\ndid i?\n\nMe:\nYou follow Frank O'Collins, who DOES make these claims. Your \"religion\" originates from a man that does.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nis this what u are talking about?\nhttp://youtu.be/gPOfurmrjxo\nGeorge Carlin on Religion and God\nyoutu.be\nits not quite religion...if you took the time to read that UCA link you would see what im talking about\nits a failsafe against religion is what i would call it\n\nMe:\nI think I've been quite clear and concise in what I am talking about. While I respect and agree with the man, I'm not sure how George Carlin entered the conversation.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nu said \"an invisible man\"\n\"wh always need samoney\"\nlol\n\nMe:\nThe entire concept originates from a man who is an admitted former Jesuit priest, who claims that angels have visited him on multiple occasions. That taints ANYTHING else that he may have to say.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nits protection against religion\nthats not actually correct\nhe was a janous priest and the hjesuits TRIED to recruit him now he fights them\nhe has dissolved the vatican with his law\nand now im using it to dissolve the BAR\nTemple Bar\npriests of Baahl\nevil fucks\n\nMe:\nDissolved the Vatican, eh? They seem to still currently be alive and thriving\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nwindow dressing\nthey are falling\ncrumbling\nthe lien is cured in june\n\nMe:\nYour name is \"Sovereign underGOD\"... You don't get to announce yourself by his name, and then claim to NOT be religious. See how that works?\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\n3 year lien process\nits in the judges benchbook...\nits what gives them immunity\n\nMe:\nSo it must be true?\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nworks for me\nIf the entire thing is fraud, why would you want to associate yourself with any part of it?\ni tried to fight it...it is easier to infiltrate\ndestroy from within\n\nMe:\nThere is NO \"higher power\", there is NO \"creator\". We're all just semi-evolved chimps and originated from stardust. That's it.\nHow have you \"infiltrated\" anything?\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nyes but there is 100 monkey effect and critical mass\ncollective concious is real\n\nMe:\nYou're publicly campaigning to raise funds to take them down. This word you're using, \"infiltrate\", I do not think it means what you think it means.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nlots of studies prove it\nno im campaining to gain awareness\nfor critical mass\n\nMe:\nWell, collective retarded-ness, perhaps\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\ni am not expecting money\nbesides i get money from promisorries\n\nMe:\n\"Infiltrate, verb: to enter or gain access to (an organization, place, etc.) surreptitiously and gradually, especially in order to acquire secret information.\" Tell me, how does publicly campaigning for cash fit into your stealthy plan?\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUZFnaVPaoU\nThe 100th Monkey Theory - The Law Of Critical Mass #275\nwww.youtube.com\ni was quiet tell i set up the account\nnow i am exposing with proof\n\nMe:\nSo what is it you are infiltrating with this \"UnderGod\" crap, and how?\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\ni have infiltrated and now i am showing the masses whats up\nit lets the judges know that i know their secrets\nthats all\nanyway good luck...have fun\ntry not to judge\n\nMe:\nYou have infiltrated what, exactly? And how have you accomplished this?\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nwell their system\nby applying the remedy available\nthe birth bond\nredeemed at the treasury wickit\nand deposited to the DTC\ni have a direct treasury account with 100 billion in it...i have all the account numbers would u like to check it?\ndo u know anyone elase that can offer you account numbers ?\nhttp://www.dtcc.com/\n\nMe:\nAnd what could referring to yourself as \"under god\" possibly have to do with that?\n\nSovereign UnerGod:\nOMG u r stuk on tha arent u\nno pun intended\nlol\nits a mecanism to secure my person in court\nthe judge immediatly knows that i know their secrets\nthey treat me with fear\nthey are afraid\n\nMe:\nOf course they do...\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nas they should be\nthey are public servants\n\nMe:\nSo, I have to ask. Of all the people commenting on the thread, why exactly would you choose me to respond to privately?\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\ni messaged the others...u are the only one willing to convers i guess\nwell because its pretty easy to bash someone when they cant defend themselves hey\ntey kiked me\n\nMe:\nOkay...but why leave the group forum...the one where everyone WAS speaking to you?\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nwithout letting me explain and are now on attack\nthey baned me\ni didnt leave\nthey banned me then attacked when i couldnt defend\nthose are your buddies hey\nnot very honorable IMHO\npoor excuse for \"administrators\"\n\nMe:\nWe don't take kindly to bullshit. Leading with money and religion...it was only a matter of time.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nwell its not bullshit i can bak everything\nso there ya have it\nthey are afraid i guess\nno biggie\ni have my own groups going..just wanted to have some decent conversation\nAnything involving money or religion IS bullshit.\nbut i guess you all cant even have a discussion without being afraid of where it might lead\nwich leads me to believe that its them tat is bullshit\n\nMe:\nNo, we just don't tolerate lies. You obviously have NO idea what money is.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nlol\nyaok\n\nMe:\nAnyways, this is going nowhere.\n\nSovereign UnderGod:\nthats why i use paper instruments\nya good luck..have fun..stay safe\nnice chatting\nbye",
