   "message": "I was out for a walk Sunday night, went to cross the street on a marked cross walk , the simple flashing walk , so I did , there was a guy in a van setting there in the intersection waiting for me to cross so he could make his right turn , as I stepped out in the street , a lady come storming up the street and make a left turn and BANG she hit me , my kness went threw her grill and I landed on her hood , the buddy in the van seen it all as it took place , the police , ambulance come took me in to have checked out , no broken bones , but fucked my shoulders, back ,arms and both legs , she was given a ticket for not yielding to a pedestrian, and told the police she did not see me, it was a well open intersection, daylight, and good visibility I do belive she had her cell rested on her left shoulder and this is the case where she did not turn her head before turning , Now icbc her insurance ??",
