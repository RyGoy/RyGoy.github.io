   "message": "Anyways David, I hit a girl on a bike in Kelowna. She was flying straight across a street and I was doing a u-turn. I was looking for cars coming, not some chick deciding that her bike was no longer a vehicle and crossed the street (and much rain going on also). I slammed on the brakes as I just saw her and she fell off her bike. She hurt her elbow, etc. No damage to car or anything. I was deemed at fault but she apparently was leaving for Thailand for a year. The insurance company said she has three (or four) years to come back with a claim.",
