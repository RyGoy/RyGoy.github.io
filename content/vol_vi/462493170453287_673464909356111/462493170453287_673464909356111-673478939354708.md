   "message": "In BC you must get insurance on the car you want to buy BEFORE you get the car, meaning you cannot drive it home without insurance first. In AB you have a week. So you can keep creating a Bill of Sale every week and say you just got the car... which is why they stopped that in BC cause nobody was getting insurance and driving around with 3 day old Bill of Sales..",
