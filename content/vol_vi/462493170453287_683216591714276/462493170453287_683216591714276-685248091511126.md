   "message": "The \"surname\" would be what you consider your \"last name\".  If your mommy & daddy GIVE  you this first and middle name, what do they call you?  I have a GIVEN name and I have a TAKEN name and no one denies these names to me.  I TOOK them and I USE them. \n\nI don't allow the use of the MIDDLE INITIAL either.  Think on that....",
