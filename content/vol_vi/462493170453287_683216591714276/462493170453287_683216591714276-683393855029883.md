   "message": "Okay, lost me on this GIVEN versus TAKEN name shit. I thought I knew  Pete but now not so sure. That's a lot of fucking names you were GIVEN brother. I'm not one to talk though. I thought the names we were GIVEN is what ended up on the REGISTRATION and ultimately the BC. In your case it's just PIERRE DAOUST without the rest of your name train. Am I to understand that the GIVEN name has nothing to do with the REGISTERED NAME that created the PERSON? My Name was REGISTERED as DAVID PAUL. This is my PERSON on the BC. My GIVEN names are David-Paul Patrick.So if I use David or David-Paul then are these the names I have TAKEN?",
