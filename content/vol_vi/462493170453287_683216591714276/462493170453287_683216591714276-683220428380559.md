   "message": "We know the government wouldn�t exist without us. It would be worth nothing and would be INSOLVENT.\nChris pointed out they are in RECEIVERSHIP : they are PRESERVING the CARGO / NAME and TRANSPORTING it back to the men and women who DEPOSITED it�\n\n�Receivership n. the process of appointment by a court of a receiver to take custody of the property, business, rents and profits of a party to a lawsuit pending a final decision on disbursement or an agreement that a receiver control the financial receipts of a person who is deeply in debt (insolvent) for the benefit of creditors. Thus, the term \"the business is in receivership.\" (See: receiver)�\n\nThe VESSELS they are using to do that are the PERSONS.\nYou, the man or woman, are in CONTROL of a VESSEL which is THEIRS.\nYou, the man or woman, are PRESUMED SURETY for their VESSEL. - if you respond to the NAME before it reaches PORT\n\nALL they care about is the CARGO and their LAWS are in effect until the CORGO reaches the place where it�s being sent� A WHARF\nIt would make sense to me that we want a PRIVATE TRUST to be that WHARF ?\n\nAnd like any good shipper, they have INSURED the CARGO on that VESSEL they gave you.\nShould you, one day, fuck that CARGO up, they will try to make you pay, but since you are not their SLAVE and you never asked or consented to SAILING THEIR SHIP for FREE, you have the right to that INSURANCE / SURETY� \n\nBut it seems they wanna avoid claiming to that INSURANCE and instead they want you, by believing you are that VESSEL, to pay for it� So when they educated you so that you could be set free on the great SEA of COMMERCE, they omitted to INFORM you about that INSURANCE.\n\nAre we all sailing in the right direction ?",
