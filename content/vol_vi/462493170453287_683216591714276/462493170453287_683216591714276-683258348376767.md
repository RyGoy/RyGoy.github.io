   "message": "Thanks for the definition of RECEIVORSHIP Will Bed \"Chris pointed out they are in RECEIVERSHIP\" Sooooooo TRUE. This triggered something for me. I had read many times that CANADA was bankrupt. Unlike 'Murika and HJR 192 I could not confirm or find any reference to this. After watching a FREE-DUMB movie (Consent of the Governed as I recall) I remembered that Canada was created by the British North America Act...yes the BNA is taught in school :) . Therefore any Bankruptcy would likely only be found in British Acts and Statutes since CANADA is a BRITISH VESSEL. Now there's a PERSPECTIVE that isn't given through any PUBLIC programming lol! \n\nI then turned to reading another FREE-DUMBER book by Robert Menard and discovered the only evidence of Canada's bankruptcy I know of currently. It is a strange title I had known about for years but did not understand nor appreciate...Tell me if you recognize it? The RECEIVER GENERAL of CANADA. From reading another thread today I just made another connection from the word GENERAL...Generals command armies. Armies are restricted to land. Is this the connection to Pete's \"land stuff\"?",
