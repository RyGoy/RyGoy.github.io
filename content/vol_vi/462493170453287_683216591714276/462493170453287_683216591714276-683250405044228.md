   "message": "Dean Clifford was ratified into AQUILAE almost 3 years ago. He was secured and freed. The police had NO standing to enforce ANY POLICY on him. All Dean had to do was alert AQUILAE. He didn't.\n\nALL of you watched THAT play out.\n\nHe was SUPPOSED to establish a STONE FRIGATE in Manitoba, and then turn command over to Erick Kirov (AV TYSON NX-16) and HE would be trained as a CAPTAIN on the TYSON. When he was ready, he'd be GIVEN command of AV COPERNICUS (NX-1) which would be finished construction by then.\n\nNow it looks like Daniel J Wentz will be commanding COPERNICUS AND chairing NX2000; Which, speaking as ADMIRAL, I REALLY dislike. BOTH jobs chew up a BIG chunk of life. I chaired NX2000 for 10 years, so I know what's involved. I was CAPTAIN of the AUST-MARU (NX-7) for 2 years, and I know what's involved there too!\n\nDean Clifford cost us more than Menard did.",
