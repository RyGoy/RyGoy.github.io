   "message": "From the File \"learning as I go along\" There is a lawyer who allegedly is working on behalf of a bank to collect money from 2 persons, even though they received a zero balance statement from the bank. This lawyer has threatened garnishing wages, and a lien. He is now threatening a \"Direction to enforce\" instruction to the local sheriff. \n\nOn numerous occasions this lawyer has been asked to provide proof of standing and a true bill. Nothing has been received to date. He has included in the letter a copy of the Direction to Enforce that he says he will send to the sheriff to sell the home etc. \n\nA corporation I trust has liened the property for the equity, he is about to be in default for non payment of his account with us. (not to mention racking up more charges with this letter ). \n\nMy question(s) are;\n\nIF he does plan on this course of action, can he force the sale of a house for an unsecured line of credit?\n\nThe fact that there is no sheriff file number on it, makes me think he is using  intimidating and scare tactics. Will I receive notice from the sheriff IF he does go ahead with this (before they come knocking?)\n\nIs there anything else that needs to be considered?",
