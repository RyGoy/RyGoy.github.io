   "message": "I have read the bank act and no where in it does it say you need to provide ID to open an account that is a requirement of the bankers association and they have locked in investments of mine they refuse to release they did a search iof their archives and they have nothing with my signature authorizing them to lock any funds in in fact they do not even know where the funds came from. After contacting ther financial services board they tell me that a signature is required to grant consent to transferring the funds and locking them in. I sent a demand letter to the finance minister using section 337 of the criminal code demanding the release of my property The bank does not like what i am doing the service manager shit her pants and called head office after discussing the matter with the branch manager",
