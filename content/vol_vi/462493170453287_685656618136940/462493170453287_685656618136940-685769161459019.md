   "message": "Admiral Scott, and Captain Pete Daoust, I will ask pose the question again: \n\n1- Ok Pete, I know I am the CREDITOR. And I know all notices go with the seal, preferably (that's how I do it), but what I meant is that the BILL OF EXCHANGE needs an authorized signature in the back. You had told me that you sign under the capacity of SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR. Are you saying now that we need to qualify the capacity of the signature as CREDITOR, instead of Administrator? I am a bit confused.\n\n2- How many times must I send CONSIDERATION for a public debt?  In the case of a utility bill, do you need to send a birth certificate every month? That sounds impractical, but now I want to know as well.",
