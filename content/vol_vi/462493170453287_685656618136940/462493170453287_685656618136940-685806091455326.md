   "message": "Eli Weakley the reason I post this video is for you to listen an IRS agent explaining HOW to fill the VOUCHER/MONEY ORDER to the person he happens to have.\n\nThe reason we ask for REMITTANCE every time, with any organization, it is because other entities may have DIFFERENT methods on how to complete the draft/money order. \n\nIn this particular case of this Man, the agent told him this instructions were specific just for the IRS, and maybe for this specific account.\n\nOther than this video, I DO NOT recommend anything else coming from this wacko, Christopher Flemings.",
