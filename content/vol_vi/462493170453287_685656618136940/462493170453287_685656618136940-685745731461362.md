   "message": "Kent Barrett, the way I have learned it is that: the person you happen to have received a bill. Because slavery and/or involuntary servitude are a crime, they gave us these surety bonds, just like a whole bunch of $20 dollar bills, to SETTLE any BILLS under the NAME, because buying back those BILLS that do not belong to \"ME\" by FORCE is SLAVERY. So you may ONLY administrate these public debts, unless you want to \"pay.\"\n\nIf the surety bond if just like a $20 dollar bill (in which YOU are not surety for those instruments, but just enjoy the BENEFIT), when you get a BILL from them, just like with any other \"payment\", the administrator completes the BILL and includes CONSIDERATION. This time you are not PAYING, you are ADMINISTRATING. So instead of CASH, of a CHECK, or CREDIT CARD, etc., you include that surety bond as a way to SETTLE the account, just like tendering a $20 bill.\n\nI hope that dumb it down a bit. If I am wrong, Scott Duncan, PLEASE correct me. Thanks!",
