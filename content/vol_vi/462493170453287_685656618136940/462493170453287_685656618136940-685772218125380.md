   "message": "this conversation brings up questions for me too...I've seen discussion about, for example, the utilities already having access to the surety account by way of the persons SIN and the debt is paid in advance, if this were true and the debt is taken care of already, would that not be credit created to take care of that debt?\n\n Pete has suggested in the past that they (utilitiy comp) spend before they receive and that is why they need us to buy back the debt. I may be mistaken, but I don't see the government working so efficiently/effectively that if a utility company presented the bank of canada a completed bill of exchange that the bank of canada would say \"No sorry utility company, you have already received credit for that debt\"? something isn't making sense for me unless the govt and corp are working together to sink the country in debt :/ where is my thinking messed up or what am I missing?",
