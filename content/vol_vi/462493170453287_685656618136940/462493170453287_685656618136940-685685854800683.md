   "message": "Eli, is the IRS already \"billing\" ADMINISTRATOR for 2013? I did not think they would even remotely send a \"letter\" until a year later (at least, that is what I am hoping... until I can get my private affairs organized).  My dad thinks 2+ years, but I doubt it.  My goal is to get lawfully prepared BEFORE THEY start \"demanding\" crap, and I was under the assumption (I know, not smart) that THEY would not do that until sometime in 2015.",
