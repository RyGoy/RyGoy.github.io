   "message": "Well Gail, I completed a bill of exchange in April, and it ended up the company decided THEY WOULD NOT COLLECT the SURETY, they would ERASE THE DEBT from the ACCOUNT instead ? They DID return the completed bill of exchange, not REFUSED, along with the birth certificate which was sent to them...\n\nBy ERASING the DEBT, they just spit on +/- 4 times the usual amount of the monthly bill... WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT !???",
