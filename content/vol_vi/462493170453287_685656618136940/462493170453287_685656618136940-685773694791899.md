   "message": "Whenever you SIGN a bill, you give it that VALUE. But it seems the Utility Company don't know that... The birth certificate is PROOF of an UNLIMITED CREDIT LIMIT. By sending a notarized copy of the birth certificate, you give them the proof that you can authorize the SURETY to create the CREDIT and pay the bill. The birth certificate is the \"key\" to the SURETY if you will. \n\nAs Pete once told me, if the government made profits, you could show up with the birth certificate and use it to collect dividends...\n\nSame with the SURETY, if the utility company shows up without the \"key\" and they want to \"unlock\" the SURETY, that may be more difficult than if they show up with the \"key\" which undoubtedly authorizes the SURETY to CREATE that CREDIT... The fact that you can provide the birth certificate is PROOF that you are indeed the CREDITOR for that PERSON... That is the consideration.\n\nNow I guess once you have proven it once, you don't have to prove it again, but what do I know ? Haven't been there yet...\n\nSo I'd ask them something like\n\nDear Utility Company, last month I sent the completed bill of exchange with a notarized copy of the PERSON's birth certificate as CONSIDERATION. I see you've been able to get your payment from the PERSON's SURETY, so it seems both you and the SURETY know you'll now be doing business together on a regular basis from now on, AM I CORRECT ? Now I'm wondering, for future bills sent to the PERSON, would you and/or the Bank of Canada require a new copy of the birth certificate each time, or can an original just be kept on file or whatever and I only have to return the completed bill of exchange itself ? Please let me know before you send the next bill, because it's never been never will be my intention to cause delays and/or trouble and/or create controversy and I want to make sure you guys are all set !",
