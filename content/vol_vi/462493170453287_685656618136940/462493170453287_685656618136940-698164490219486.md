   "message": "I think before sending bills of exchange out of the blue, one should make the necessary notices, to give opportunity for these trustees to obey the law (where there is still hope), and to be in a strong undeniable position as the Sole Authorized Administrator. \n\nIf you have a VALUABLE SECURITY from the State Register's Office, and you are going to be acting as Administrator, don't you think it would be good to give these people notice FIRST? And then, notify the rest about your INTENTIONS via notices. There is a few comments of Scott about notifying the Register that the SECURITY has been delivered, making you the HOLDER IN DUE COURSE, and announce that you are acing as Administrator. \n\nFor example, if you send the IRS, or CRA, not only a notice, but also an AFFIRMATION from the Administrator attached, and copies of the published notice as Administrator in a newspaper attached, when they receive your communication there is no space to deny that you are IN FACT the Administrator, and is less likely that they will start acting funny.\n\nPlan ahead! Cover all bases! Do not do anything you do not understand WHY you are doing it.",
