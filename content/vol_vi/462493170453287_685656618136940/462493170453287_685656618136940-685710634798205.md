   "message": "Well, you sort of know my \"nature\" based on the way I communicate with others in other \"groups\".  I realize that many have mental constructs based on belief.  I don't subscribe to such stuff, let alone labels.  For whatever reasons, it does not 'bother' me.  Of course, if someone expects ME to go along with their beliefs.... well, we have sort of a \"problem\" - well, more of problem for them, not me.  I can really care less of what others think of me.  That is their issue, not mine.\n\n[ Well Eli, as always, been a pleasure.  I apologize for blowing up your thread. I have to clock out and eventually go to bed. ]",
