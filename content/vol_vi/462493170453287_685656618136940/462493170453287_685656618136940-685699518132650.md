   "message": "Most of them are trying to \"change\" things via their VOTER REGISTRATION CONTRACTS, which we are in disagreement about.  I don't get mad, I just put my energy and focus elsewhere.  I have two close friends who are on the \"same page\".  We have agreed to assist each other if (or when) SHTF.  We openly trade/barter for \"stuff\", labor, etc.\n\nBeen trying to promote that in my own community, but most really like those FRN's.",
