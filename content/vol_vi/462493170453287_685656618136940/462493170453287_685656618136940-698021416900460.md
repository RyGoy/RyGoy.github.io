   "message": "UPDATE!  The IRS is just as slow and bumbling as any other government agency because my friend just received a response to the letter sent using Captain Pete's \"Forrest Gump\" approach.  I will post a scan later but it effectively says they'll contact him again in 90 days or so because they need time to research the matter! They would cease sending notices about the matter in the meantime!",
