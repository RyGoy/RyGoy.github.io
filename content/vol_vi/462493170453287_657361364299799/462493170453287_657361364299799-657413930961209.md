   "message": "The cops won't give a shit about your paperwork.  You will need to stand your ground orally at any contact. I had to do it a couple of years ago and it's what lead me here. It worked for me but as I had not tested it, I can tell you it was an adrenalin pumping experience. I knew it worked at the end when the cop (one foot in my lobby and the other about to follow)  retreated upon hearing my battle cry \"I DO NOT CONSENT TO YOU ENTERING MY HOME, STEP BACK ACROSS THE THRESHOLD!\" And he did pretty fucking quickly I'll tell you. :-)",
