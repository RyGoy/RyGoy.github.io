   "message": "pete, a man; sole authorized administrator of PETE DOAUST, notices that he;  DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT WHATEVER THEY WANT TO RECOGNIZE OR NOT.\n\nAwesome, nobody has to recognize you, I agree.  But since i recognize you, pete, i recognize I misspoke, you're correct......I should've said:\n\nIn order to DISTINGUISH yourself as the no-bullshit-havin-badass-lady-slaying-stud you are, it's best done at the OUTSET when you're born, or perhaps when you're 16 (and if not then, now will do because you're competent and have the self respect and integrity to administrate your affairs with all the ladies, Pete.).\n\nAt least we can agree we don't give two shits WHAT the fuckin party of authority is called so long as it's distinguished correctly without fraud, at the OUTSET.\n\nIf LOS BLANC is addressed with some mail from a Utility, I look for the party of authority at the beginning of the document.  If it's not clearly defined, I send notice of my requirement that it be properly defined so I can administrate the shit correctly to the proper party.  If they fail to define who \"my\" PERSON owes, then it's possible they're perpetrating fraud, intentionally or by mistake, while attempting to make \"my\" PERSON an accessory to it.",
