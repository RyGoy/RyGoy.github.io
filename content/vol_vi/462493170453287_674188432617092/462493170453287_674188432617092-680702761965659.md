   "message": "I suppose the agent acts to my detriment when I fail to properly define the principal and it's value at the OUTSET of a bill, claim, notice, etc.\n\nMe thinks that when wannabe creditors fail to define the principal at the outset, the judge then has a FIDUCIARY DUTY to define the principal by claiming it as abandoned property / cargo in need of salvage so it can be moved \"back on land\" under GENERAL jurisdiction where it can be ACCOUNTED for and DEEMED a collateralized security asset until the wannabe creditor finally mans up and claims the principal.\n\nIf the principal was just sitting there abandoned at sea or dormant in a warehouse, then it wouldn't be moving between hands.\n\nSecuritizing it as a unit of measure is a way to keep it warehoused while having something of value to move and exchange at the same time.\n\n\"money of exchange = good  \n\nmoney of account = bad\"",
