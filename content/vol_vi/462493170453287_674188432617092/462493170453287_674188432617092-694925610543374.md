You are still stupid in the end, and you don't actually LEARN anything.\n\nThat's GREAT if you are a Cum-Bunny (Meaning great for ME) because you won't actually LEARN anything, yet have the illusion of \"knowledge\" while still parroting what is essentially \"ritual\" which happens to be the right answer.\n\nFAITH works for Cum-Bunnies. It won't work for ANYONE ELSE.\n\nTRUST BUT VERIFY.",
