   "message": "What follows is not the whole story Pete but in my ADMINISTRATION of the HST ACCOUNT the CRA was given NOTICE that I require $500/hr and estimate 30 hours annually to ADMINISTRATE and provide TAX COLLECTION SERVICE. CRA was sent an invoice for services rendered.  After sending CRA numerous INVOICE, CRA then escalated matter to COMMISSIONER of APPEALS. I DECLINED the offer to APPEAL (understanding it as an attempt to regain jurisdiction) and sent COMMISSIONER copy of the INVOICE. I followed up with  NOTICE of DEFAULT and REQUEST to CURE. I have not heard a peep since August 2013",
