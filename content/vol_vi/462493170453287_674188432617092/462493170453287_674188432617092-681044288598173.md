You can continue to allow your programming to \"defend\" yourself with a result of little value to you, or you can read the information posted, open up to learning, and recognize that specific words are used for a reason, that may be beyond your grasp at this moment, but will make sense as you learn. It all comes down to a choice for you, either you are here to learn something that you don't know, or you are here to defend what you think you know. One perspective will benefit you greatly, the other will keep you in the present holding pattern. Up to you. :)",
