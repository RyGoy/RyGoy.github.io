   "message": "Your comments on the use of \"RED INK\" Scott, reminded me of something else this Peter from Privatis.me has talked about before. \"Putting a RED-BOX around it,\" as he has put it. With the use of a RED-marker, in combination somehow with the use of the FOUR CORNERS RULE he has talked about the effectiveness of 'framing' the inside of the borders with a thick marker in RED-ink for any sort of B.S. Notice one may get from the Government, etc. before you send it back to the sender. Unfortunately- he has never really explained WHY this would be effective, as he seems to use it as a lure to get people to go pay to join his site to learn more about it. Is there anything to this 'RED BOX' method, Scott?\n\nDEEMED = in the absence of any evidence to the contrary",
