   "message": "So the legal name that i happen to have is in need of a new driving licence. \nIt's going to cost me ï¿½55 for the pleasure of receiving this licence. The cash has to be paid at the window before they print the licence.\nThis has to be one of those times that the licence gets signed as: sole authorised administrator, by qualifying, maybe Vi Coactus or ...before signing? \nWhat can you do about the photo that they want to be on the licence?",
