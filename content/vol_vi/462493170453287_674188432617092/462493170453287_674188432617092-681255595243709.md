I have read many examples where folks have given NOTICE of their ADMINISTRATION fees/\"fee schedule\" when settling any CLAIMS for the PERSON. I have done the same previously with the CRA in the matter of an HST account (that's another story which will make for a great thread on its own) Can/should the same be done with respect to FILING an INCOME TAX RETURN?",
