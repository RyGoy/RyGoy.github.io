   "message": "I've had a default judgement against me...I didn't accept being a defendant (because it was a private settled agreement) my paper work was not accepted by the court and the clerk proceeded with a judgement against me. The liar is now threatening garnish wages (my husband is an employee)....I went deposit a NOM and BC and decline their offer...the clerk said i have to send all to the plaintiff and complete a motion to be defendant. I don't want to be a defendant and am wondering if depositing a praecipe with a NOM is something I can do, is it too late (I think I should have used the praecipe initially? \n\nIn Robb Ryders video about praecipe, he says in Canada praecipes can be used instead of motions.",
