   "message": "Thanks  everyone!  I have been administering with CRA Im just not sure about laws governing trustees in BR.  OK, so I accept on the condition that they provide me with a bill. When they send a bill I am going to administrate the bill through the surety for STEVE in the same way I am administering CRA. It is still a little bit counter intuitive to me as I do not want to accept the debt and I have little experience in successful administration. To be sure I was thinking of having someone I trust (my older daughter) lien the home as I presently no not have a corp or trust set up.",
