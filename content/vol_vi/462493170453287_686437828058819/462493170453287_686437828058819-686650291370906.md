   "message": "Indeed, Pete Daoust would say : \"Where's the bill!?\" :P\n\nREMEMBER : Its your PERSON's family home. Not yours.\nThey want money from your PERSON.\n\nIt's a BANKRUPTCY issue, but you guys are still VALUABLE CREDITORS for those PERSONS.\n\nIf I were you, I'd use the SURETY. That's what it's for ! If the birth certificate is an UNLIMITED CREDIT LIMIT, USE IT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO IT and MAKE SURE YOUR PERSON's CREDIT SCORE REMAINS CLEAN !!!\n\nIf they want your PERSON to buy back that debt, they must send a BILL. Without a BILL, there's no PROOF that your PERSON must pay them 14 000, especially if that DEBT never has been your PERSON's... AND you wanna be able to balance the books CREDIT/DEBIT so WHENEVER money of account comes out of your PERSON's ACCOUNT, you need a BILL.\n\nThen ... Seems Gail pretty much read my mind :)",
