   "message": "If I may, I'd like to vet an arising scenario here that I am unsure about how to respond. I'd much rather be torn apart  and spit out here than in court. The matter involves a trustee in Bankruptcy... BDO who has sent me an \"offer\" to settle what they deem \"an undervalue transaction\" when I transferred the title of my family home back to myself as sole title 6months before my wife claimed bankruptcy. Not my choice or descision for her to do that, but thats what she went with. My initial verbal response to the trustee was that  except for a brief period of 1.5 years. When my wife was added she was added for the consideration of one dollar as was the case when title was returned to me, the same consideration. They are \"offering\" to allow me to pay them 14,000.00 as an out of court settlement based on what they say her consideration should have been. We are, still married. She has signed an affidavit stating she has no matrimonial interest in the property. I drafted a letter. My first thought was to respond aggressively declining their offer to contract and including my fee schedule for any further administration of contact or actions they  decide to take and that  any action would be acceptance of my fee schedule. In my draft I included that I would charge fees to individuals acting on behalf of the corporation as well as the  corp and that I would  collect and lien them. I am as you may know, threatening things I have no real clue how to carry out with any degree of certainty.   I like what Pete was talking about \" I would be happy to pay but I don't want to buy, and you have to buy before you can pay\"! I don't wanna buy. They don't deserve any more of the little we have left. Im not sure how to best administrate this best. I would just like them to go away and leave me alone as I don't have 14,000 cents at the moment.  My second thought was to accept the offer to pay through the SURETY for my PERSON or third, accept the offer and send a chq for a nominally lesser amount like 100.00 to settle the account? If you have been patient enough to read this far and do actually have a clue, Id appreciate the feedback, or the ridicule!",
