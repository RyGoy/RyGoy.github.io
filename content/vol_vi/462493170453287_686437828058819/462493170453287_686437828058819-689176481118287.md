It has been a process to unscrew my mind from the concept of being the PERSON and SURETY to having a PERSON and deflecting SURETY... which is WaaaY Cooler. I guess I still have not understood fully how it is used in these different situations but your comments have again helped so thank you. I hope to not make you \"sigh\" for real ever!  Question:  Can I just rant a little bit about how they are crooks and why their offer  is BS before I agree to administrate the debt if they provide me with a bill? Or should I just shut up and administer? I have made note of 37 things NOT to say from a recent post here.  ;)",
