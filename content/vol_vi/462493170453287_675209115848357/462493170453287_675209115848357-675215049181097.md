   "message": "I know enough to know that it does not matter what I believe but only what I can prove and I have no desire to engage anyone in anything other than what's necessary to destroy the deceptions and fallacies that exist within the current governments use of force to impose their theft upon myself and others. I honestly believe that people should not under any circumstance be forced to believe anything other than what they want to.  I'm completer against the concept of two wolves and a sheep voting on whats for dinner.  It's not fair to the sheep.",
