   "message": "It's a baby girl.  Happy,  healthy, beautiful and My PROPERTY.   \n\nThis nurse we had,  threatened me with child family services if I didn't sign this paperwork of live birth record... And I was being a perfect gentleman,  only asking questions honourably and honestly wanting answers to questions like  \"Am I obligated by law to sign this document?\"  \"By who's authority?\" and that's all it took for her to mention \"negligence\" on my part and \"child family services\" so I'm kind of pissed off that my concern has brought her to the brink of informing authorities. \n\nSO I also REFUSED the screening process where they poke a hole in my property and take blood samples for supposed screening,  and the doctor said he might have to contact child family services because it is neglect to place my child in potential danger...   I asked him to advise me on the correct course of action based on his professional opinion so I'm not neglecting anything. Also I asked if I had a right to refuse the screening and he claimed he'd NEVER HAD ANYONE REFUSE BEFORE ME and I asked him to make sure I had no right to refuse...  He came back with a pamphlet and a print out detailing my RIGHT TO REFUSE SCREENING.  \n\nWhat an ordeal this is.  I'm still unsure of what to do here.  I'm not prepared to take on child family kidnappers.",
