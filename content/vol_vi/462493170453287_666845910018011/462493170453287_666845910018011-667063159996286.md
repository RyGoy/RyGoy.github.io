   "message": "As soon as you try to have a kid and they find out you're together, they  apparently slap the common law label on you faster than you can blink either way - basically the same thing as marriage licence for the court system incase you split up - in which case they can still steal your kid. hell, I have a friend who wasn't with a boyfriend by the time the delivery rolled around, and they still stole her kid giving her visitation rights but raised by the province. Unless it's different from what i've been told, that's what I was told by them, their lips to my ears - but it varies from province to province. \nMarriage licence or not, you can still dictate stipulations on the bond they are now attempting to coerce you into signing for your child. \nIf they don't satisfy your terms that you want fulfilled, screw them.\nThey are PUBLIC SERVANTS. THEY SERVE YOU.",
