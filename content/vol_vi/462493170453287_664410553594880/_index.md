   "message": "I have a fellow employee at work who has been fairly receptive to my information regarding taxes yet still filed with intent to buy back these PUBLIC DEBTS attached to his PERSON. This PERSON owes roughly $800.00 USD to the IRS. So when he filed turbotax gave him the option of setting up a payment plan with the IRS. He did accept that option. He brought this correspondence to me today seeking help with the matter. It seems to me the IRS is making him an offer and this payment plan agreement/contract has not been finalized. The terms laid out in this correspondence are rather intrusive and I pointed that out. I want to discharge this debt via the SURETY of this mans PERSON. So there are what appear to be INCHOATE INSTRUMENTS provided. These are different from any I have seen in my limited experience. I am not sure if these have been provided to grant remedy for the fee associated with the payment plan but I am leaning in that direction. I would really appreciate some input on this. Can this entire debt be discharged with these. I am going to try in lieu of any advice contrary.",
