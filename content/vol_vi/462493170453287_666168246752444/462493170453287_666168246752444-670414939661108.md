   "message": "In civil law, the bill of exchange is strictly an abstract document, which means that the obligations arising from the document are unconditional and cannot be connected with obligations from other documents. So, under article 26 of the Geneva Uniform Law, the acceptance of a bill of exchange is unconditional. Under common law, the obligation from a bill of exchange can be made subject to performance of another obligation.  \nUnder Geneva Uniform Law a bill of exchange can be issued on order only, while under common law a bill of exchange can be issued on bearer.",
