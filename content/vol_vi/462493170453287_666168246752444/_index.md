   "message": "There was a thread started by \"Maximus Legis\" regarding discharging of public debt in which I was posting about my ongoing dealing with the Waste Management Company I use, Panda...\n\nThe thread and Maximus seem to have left Facebook... \n\nSo I thought I'd re-post it here...\n\nI received an invoice for x amount from Panda with a number of remittances (instructions on how to pay a debt). \n\nI replied asking the company to confirm that they had supplied all/every remittance.\n\nThey replied with a letter re-stating the previously supplied remittances and also included \"bank transfer\" which had been omitted originally.\n\nSo I then replied asking for a bill... \n\n*An invoice outlines the cost of goods/services.\n*A bill informs the PERSON that they are in debt for the cost amount of goods/services.\n\nThey have replied by issuing a copy of the original invoice.\n\nSo, should I write back requesting a bill again and inform them of administrative fees they will incur should they respond with anything but a bill?\n\nCheers for any comments...",
