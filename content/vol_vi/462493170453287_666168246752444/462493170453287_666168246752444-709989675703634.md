   "message": "Panda are back! :D\n\nDespite my completion of their bill and instructing them on presentment to central bank for payment they refused it and sent it back. So I sent notice that they should consider the matter closed as payment refused discharges any debt... That was back on May 22nd...\n\nThey phoned yesterday (they've been sending texts every month since)\nI told them I sent payment and they refused it. The guy asked was it a cheque or...? I said it was a completed bill of exchange and that they should contact me in writing rather than over the phone...\n\nSo they issued the SAME bill again today... Dated 15/4/2014...\n\nDoes the fact that I told them to contact me in writing open their claim back up now? Did I enter a new contract over the phone?\n\nOr should I just send it back with this letter?",
