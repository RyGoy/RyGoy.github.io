   "message": "Will got to the answer before me, nice one will. I have to admit i've been following the \"freetard \"movement for about four years now and have some \"so called friends\" who are now turning on me because  their BELIEFS are being questioned, Some of these freetards  that i know are giving people legal advice and leading them up the garden path to the slaughter, for example taking plenary summons to the high court against the banks for fraud to try hold off the banks repossessing their homes.They are doing this for cash too. I'm fucking sick and tired of their shit at this stage. I might not be very intelligent but bullshit always smells like bullshit to me.Thanks to scott  i'm on the right track now.",
