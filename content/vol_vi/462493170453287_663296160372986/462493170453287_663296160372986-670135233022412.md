SCOTT IS ALWAYS RIGHT!\n\nIF I SAY \"BY WHAT AUTHORITY\" I, in fact MEAN \"BY WHAT AUTHORITY\"!\n\nTO OFFER SOMETHING ELSE MEANS YOU THINK I HAVE MADE A FUCKING MISTAKE, AND I HAVE NOT.\n\nYOU ARE NOT SMARTER THAN ME.\n\nYOU DO NOT KNOW AS MUCH AS ME.\n\nI CHOOSE MY WORDS VERY CAREFULLY, AND CHANGING THEM IS A DIRECT OFFENSE AGAINST ME.\n\nYOU DO NOT GET TO QUESTION IF MY WORDING IS CORRECT. YOU ONLY NEED PONDER WHY IT'S CORRECT. DO NOT EVER DO THAT AGAIN, Gerry Odonothing.",
