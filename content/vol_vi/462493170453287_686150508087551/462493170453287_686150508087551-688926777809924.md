   "message": "i played with picassa but didn't like it at the time. basically I use an old program called Super-JPG by Midnight Blue that i acquired from FOSI quite some time ago for 90% of what i need image editing. that and photoshop v 5 - 7 still work quite well for anything i need to do.\nI can even scan at 3000 dpi and print those funny legal tender notes at 18\" wide.\n\nyou remember those days, FOSI, OSCAR,  and ofcourse the serialz 2000 database.",
