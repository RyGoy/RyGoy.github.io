   "message": "Scott Duncan, Gail Marie, and anyone else.\nOn a previous post I was asking for help about the local property tax here in Ireland.\nThe Revenue wanted me to register my details, so I would become surety for the house tax.  \nI did not give JOINDER.\nThis is the link to the previous post \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/tenderforlaw/permalink/618967074805895\n\nIt was not a BILL that they sent to the LEGAL NAME, not a NOTICE, it was a letter demanding money.\n\nScott Duncan's advice was that I give NOTICE that my time is billable for responding, should they not return an acceptable answer to my questions.\nI took Gail Marie�s advice and asked them for a Bill. I also took Eli Weakley�s advice and asked them for proof of their claim.\n\nFirstly, I sent a letter to Michael Gladney the Collector General in the Local Property Tax (LPT), he never replied, I then sent an affirmation, he never replied, then a Notice of Fault, he never replied, I then defaulted him. The week after I defaulted him he sent the LEGAL NAME a Notice (three days ago) with an account Statement Balance of 0.00 for the LPT. It also states that the declaration for this period is outstanding.\n\nIt seems that he has taken it from Pay As You Earn (PAYE/Empe) to zero the account on the LPT. \nI was self employed until 2009 and I am a stay at home dad since 2009, there was no credits on their system for a tax refund. I rang the local county Revenue dept. in Louth and the woman on the phone said that a Homecarers allowance of �800 was added to the account recently and the LPT was deducted from that. She was unable to confirm how the Homecarers Allowance appeared on that PAYE account and then stated that she is unwilling to says any more about the situation. \n\nFinally, the questions I would like an answer to if you can help:\n1.\nIs that fraud on Michael Gladney�s part if he did create that Homecarers Allowance without my application for the Allowance? \n2.\nIs it fraud on his behalf for deducting from the Homecarers Allowance in to the LPT?\n3.\nIf it is fraud, would I be liable if I did not report it to the Garda (Police)?\n4.\nI informed the local Revenue dept. of this situation, is it up to them to sort out the internal mess if the Garda needs to be involved?\n5.\nIs it none of my business as it is an internal matter and should I forget about it and go have some craic with another department?",
