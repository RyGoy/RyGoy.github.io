   "message": "Lee Edgely: A carers allowance is a specific payment. The department who issues it should be able to tell you what exactly it is for, paying the property charge won't be categorised I'll bet. Should a registered letter be sent to that department stating \"I recall signing no contract with you to deduct any such payment?\" and would that be putting them on notice now also?",
