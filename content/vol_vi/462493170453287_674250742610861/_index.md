   "message": "As I've state several times, CREDITORS should ONLY ask questions when dealing with PUBLIC agents. NEVER answer their questions and NEVER make statements. If they ask a question - YOU ask a question right BACK AT THEM. This has the effect of deflecting surety, which JUSTICES are masters of [some of them, anyway].\n\nHere is a list of questions I came up with ANYONE dealing with ANY public policy agent/enforcer should consider asking depending on the situation at hand:\n\n[feel free to add questions you come up with as comments in this tread] \n\n1. If I request for you to write things down and take note, are you obliged to do so?\n2. Can you please take detailed notes of our discussion here today?\n3.

As a public servant, are you obligated to accept trustee and surety appointment from a member of the public such as myself?\n43.
