   "message": "In fact, it DOES matter where your rights come from ;)\n\nThe right to life is the source of all rights, my rights are not granted by man, never have been.  If you want to say my rights are granted from a creator or a group of protons and neutrons gathering because of gravity it doesn�t matter to me, I won�t interfere with your dirt worship or theistic worship don�t push either my way as I don�t care what you do with your non soul or soul.  I am asking a question of you �where do your rights come from? Do you buy into the idea of the mystical demagogy of the state granting you rights through a monopoly of force point guns at you tell what business you can conduct and what business you can�t conduct or do you just play the game? \n\nI know a lot of PEOPLE who exist yet that doesn't mean their existence is valuable... even to themselves...\n\n I think that is a subjective statement their existence is not valuable to you, but why do they still live if they have a zero value to themselves?\n\nThe risk you assign / opportunity cost ? \n\nOur lives are made up of values, numbers if you will even credit and debits if that helps your accounting minds. Physics would use some of these equations Work = Force � Displacement � Cosine(theta) W = F � d � cos(theta),  Power = Work / time blah blah blah every operation we perform our brain and our body assigns a value, If that function is more costly than the required energy used to maintain operational functions for life then it will not perform it, even breathing. Opportunity cost- there is no such thing as sacrifice or selfishness.\n\nWhat's your benchmark for \"risky\" ? \n\nThis is a fluid dynamic contingent on timing. \n\nWhat kind of risk is associated with LEARNING ? \n\nNo risk associated with learning.\n\n Learning  adds value.  \n\nHow is the \"right to action\" \"PROPERTY\" ?\n\nProperty is not acquired unless by action. Since the right to life is the source of all rights, then the right to property is the only way to sustain one�s life, without property no other rights are possible. If one does not have right to which he produces he  cannot sustain his life.\n\nThe answer to the below questions are mine and mine alone. Nothing personal but I have answered these along time ago and they continue to evolve.\nWhat do you value in your life ? \nWhat's your life worth ? And why ?\nWhat are you doing with your life right now that is valuable ?\n\nI do not take offense. Please indicate where you believe I am confused.  You might want to take a bit of your own advice you said I should stop believing,  yet you stated I have good reasons to believe Michael Rame you are a bit confused.\n\nI enjoy exchange of ideas I have yet to see any form concretized ideas coming from this group.",
