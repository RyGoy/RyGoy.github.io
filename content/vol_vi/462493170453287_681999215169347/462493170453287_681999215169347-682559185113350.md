   "message": "Who were the letters for, and why did you open them?  I might apologize for that with the NOM and return what they sent, envelope and all.  Or just open it, read it, tape it back up and put Return to Sender on the envelope.  Saves postage.  Why do you care if it's discharged if it's not you?  Sounds like a general appearance to me if you ask them to do something about it.",
