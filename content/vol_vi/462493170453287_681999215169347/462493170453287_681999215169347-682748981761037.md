   "message": "There are times when it's beneficial to represent the person.. such as if you're a Plaintiff in a court case collecting on a contract, if you want to apply for essential utilities or other things you might want or need - say you order a package online and the delivery guy wants a signature.  To never represent the person is to unnecessarily suffer.  It's there for you to use to get what you want.  Do you really think it matters if the average ignoramus thinks you're the person or not?  It only really matters with judges and cops, when you're on defence.",
