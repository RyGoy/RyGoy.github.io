   "message": "Chris, you will have to excuse my ignorance. I've learned much from you and others in this group, and it is greatly appreciated.  Please understand my position. This is still new to me, and while I think I'm comprehending what I've read and what we have discussed in the past, it still doesn't alleviate my concerns. Perhaps this is more of my indoctrination. I've sent the notice of mistake that we discussed, and I followed the instructions to a T. Now I have a warrant. I'm not worried about spending a few days in jail, it wouldn't be the first time, but I'm trying to ensure I comprehend every detail in this process. It appears that I have two options. Pay the fine or file another Notice of Mistake. It seems either options leads to a loss in my persons CDL. So please forgive me if I ask dumb questions.",
