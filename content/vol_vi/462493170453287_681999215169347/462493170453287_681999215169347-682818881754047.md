Now I have a warrant. I'm not worried about spending a few days in jail, it wouldn't be the first time, but I'm trying to ensure I comprehend every detail in this process.\"\n\nHow are you going to do that?  The answers are all here....you MUST read!!\n\n\"So please forgive me if I ask dumb questions.\"\n\nYou aren't asking dumb questions....I am upset that you have used a lot of my time and not followed through on your part of the agreement.  You said you would read, yet now you require someone else to find the answer for you....its not fair to my VALUE!",
