(Yes, I know the bit of paper to which you refer, but what has it got to do with ME)....similarly, using the same logic, you have the right not to be recognised as a brass candlestick either.\n\nThe converse, being recognised as a person would be a negligent or fraudulent act and would probably end up with an insanity evaluation....same as claiming to be a brass candlestick.",
