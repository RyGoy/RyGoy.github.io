   "message": "Yup, legal fictions are not as real as the plastic or paper they're printed on....just like the BIBLE.  But the electronics and electricity in your computer is real.  HOWEVER binary code is a form of math.  Math is conceptual.....so too is your juridical person.  But who cares, IT'S ALL ACCOUNTING.\n\nSpeaking of ACCOUNTING, a man's property is collateralized in order to generate credit, because legal fictions CAN'T cognitively claim, touch, taste or see the properties of man (they only deal in debt or credit).  And as possession is 9/10 of the law, Legal Fictions can only be GRANTED legal right to title, privilege to credit and/or duty to debt as a party to a LAWFUL contract.\n\nHow do they do it?\n\nCOMMERCIAL INVOICE:\nDocument used in *foreign* trade to determine true value of the *imported* GOODS.\n\n-- Unlike the juridical PERSON, a man is foreign to the fictional U.S. Corporation and it's agents.\n\nAlso, a judge can't utilize UCC regulation on behalf of the Trust until jurisdiction is established over some manner of \"GOODS\": all tangible, MOVABLE items. (If there are no goods on the table, then the issue is subject to common law, not UCC)\n\nNOT considered \"goods\":\n-Real Estate\n-Valuable Paper (stocks, bonds, securities)\n-Services\n-Rights\n\nBILL OF LADING:\nA document signed by a carrier (a TRANSPORTER of GOODS). Carriers, using ALL modes of *transpiration*, issue bills of lading when they undertake the transportation of *cargo*\n\nCARGO:\nIn mercantile law. The load or lading of a *vessel*; goods, merchandise or whatever is CONVEYED in a ship or other merchant VESSEL (juridical persons may also be vessels)\n\nCONVEY:\nTo pass or transmit the TITLE to PROPERTY from one to another; to transfer property or the title to property by deed or instrument under seal. To convey real estate is, by an *appropriate instrument*, to transfer the legal title to it from the present owner to another.\n\n-- Sooooo, the juridical PERSON is the MERCANTILE VESSEL (appropriate instrument) used to CONVEY cargo. Man�s blood sweat and tears are the cargo presumed to be abandoned �at sea� each time man fails to identify himself as the principal.\n\nMERCANTILE AGENT:\nAgent who a PRINCIPAL authorizes to purchase and liquidate assets, and to raise funds by using the principal�s assets as loan collateral.\n\n-- That collateral is then used to generate credit that can then be moved through the Trust (via The Court Registry Investment System and Federal Financing Bank under the general supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury) to the appropriate parties WITHIN the trust.....but man is just a third party to the trust, as far as i can tell....man is not a legal fiction within the trust. Which is why it's important to know who / what the principal is....\n\nPRINCIPAL:\nFull meaning of a word should be ascertained at the OUTSET, in order that the SENSE may not be LOST by *defect of expression*, and that the law be not without reasons.\n\nThe party with authority in a business relationship. Or a business transactions face value. Refer to agent and notional.\n\n-- Basically, according to Blacks Law, it's up to the principal to decide what the principal is if it's to lawfully be the party of authority.\n\nBILL: (Formal declaration), noun allegation of facts, claim.\n\n-- Principal is ACCOUNTED for by CLAIM of FACT.\n\nSo, if you, a man, are the principal / party with authority, then logically you must define yourself as principal from the OUTSET of a CLAIM advanced before a 7th Amendment common law court of record, like as follows...\n\ni, a man; commonly known as ___________________________ claim;\n\n- Leroy Schmo (acting as fiduciary �judge�) wrongfully administrates my property, and;\n- i gave no entity consent to administrate my property, and;\n- i require the immediate restoration of my property, and;\n- i require compensation from Leroy Schmo for each minute of trespass upon said property, starting the date of ______, and; etc�\n\nThe juridical PERSON is NOT the principal, it's just an instrument of CONVEYANCE, a transporting VESSEL. Man is the principal and whatever goods and non-goods man claims as exclusive to himself, are his assets / property.\n\nSo, when man FAILS to distinguish and DEFINE the principal before a common law venue, then man has no lawful claim in fact, and his assets are thus considered abandoned. Why? Because though man IS the principal, the rule is that non compos mentis, mutes, corpses and legal fictions are ALL incapable of claiming the property of man, as only man can make and VERIFY a CLAIM / BILL to property advanced before a court of record.\n\nUndefined principal = no man = abandoned property.\n\nAt that point man can�t claim shit because the matter is now before an administrative venue / court, and administrative venues only hear legal fictions, as legal fictions may only deal in credit or debt.\n\nWhat is ADMINISTRATION?\n\nThe assets in an estate used to pay debt and beneficiaries.\n\nThe crux and linchpin to the system is that legal fictions CAN'T lawfully nor physically show up to claim rights to property under oath or affirmation before a 7th Amendment claims court of record, they can only be heard before administrative courts wherein the Judge may momentarily be relieved from his common law oath if there's NO CLAIM BY A MAN obliging the Judge uphold Oath to protect man's property. Thus, as there is no lawful claim to property before the court, and seeing as public servants are tasked with BOTH protecting [wo]man's property AND administrating the national debt, they, the public servants, must take care of any property \"abandoned at sea\".\n\nThat's when Admiralty Jurisdiction kicks in and the judge can lawfully and legally administrate a commercial UCC transaction so that the Trustee Corp can legally use the juridical PERSON to contract the Principal, allowing them to collateralize the Principal's property.",
