   "message": "The JURIDICAL PERSON is a legal fiction when you believe that it's as real as the plastic or paper it's printed on....kinda like the BIBLE.  :D\n\nBut eh, don't take my word for it.\n\nWhat is LEGAL FICTION?\n\nBelieving or assuming something not true is true. Used in judicial reasoning for avoiding issues where a new situation comes up against the law, changing how the law is applied, but not changing the text of the law.\n\nhttp://thelawdictionary.org/legal-fiction/\n\nLegal Fiction\nAn assumption that something occurred or someone or something exists which, in fact, is not the case, but that is made in the law to enable a court to equitably resolve a matter before it.\n\nIn order to do justice, the law will permit or create a legal fiction. For example, if a person undertakes a renunciation of a legacy which is a gift by will the person will be deemed to have predeceased the testator�one who makes a will�for the purpose of distributing the estate.\n\nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Legal+Fiction",
