   "message": "Right?  It's interesting to inspect where concepts are derived and how they are augmented for various purposes, legalese being one of 'em.  Of course, I don't live in a legal anything.  But that doesn't mean I can't use legal instruments in commerce. I've got an appropriate LEGAL instrument in my wallet, as a matter of fact.\n\nCONVEY:\nTo pass or transmit the TITLE to PROPERTY from one to another; to transfer property or the title to property by deed or instrument under seal. \n\nTo convey real estate is, by an *APPROPRIATE INSTRUMENT*, to transfer the legal title to it from the present owner to another.\n\nAnd what does that plastic piece of juridical PERSON convey?  The CHATTEL, of course.  :)\n\nhttp://thelawdictionary.org/convey/",
