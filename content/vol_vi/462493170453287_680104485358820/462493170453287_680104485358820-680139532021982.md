   "message": "chattel = capital\n\nchattel (n.)\nearly 13c., chatel \"property, goods,\" from Old French chatel \"chattels, goods, wealth, possessions, property; profit; cattle,\" from Late Latin capitale \"property\" (see cattle, which is the Old North French form of the same word). Application to slaves (1640s) is a rhetorical figure of abolitionists, etc.\n\nhttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chattel\n\ncattle (n.)\nmid-13c., \"property,\" from Anglo-French catel \"property\" (Old North French catel, Old French chatel), from Medieval Latin capitale \"property, stock,\" noun use of neuter of Latin adjective capitalis \"principal, chief\" (see capital (n.1)). Compare sense development of fee, pecuniary. Sense originally was of movable property, especially livestock; it began to be limited to \"cows and bulls\" from late 16c.\n\nhttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cattle&allowed_in_frame=0\n\ncapital (adj.)\nearly 13c., \"of or pertaining to the head,\" from Old French capital, from Latin capitalis \"of the head,\" hence \"capital, chief, first,\" from caput (genitive capitis) \"head\" (see capitulum). Meaning \"main, principal, chief, dominant, most important\" is from early 15c. in English. Capital letter for an upper case one is attested from late 14c. The modern informal sense of \"excellent, first-rate\" is dated from 1762 in OED (as an exclamation of approval, OED's first example is 1875), perhaps from earlier use of the word in reference to ships, \"first-rate, of the line,\" attested from 1650s. \n\nA capital crime (1520s) is one that affects the life or \"head;\" capital had a sense of \"deadly, mortal\" from late 14c. in English, a sense also found in Latin. The felt connection between \"head\" and \"life, mortality\" also existed in Old English: as in heafodgilt \"deadly sin, capital offense,\" heafdes ï¿½olian \"to forfeit life.\" Capital punishment was in Blackstone (1765) and classical Latin capitis poena. Capital gain is recorded from 1921. Capital goods is recorded from 1899. Related: Capitally.\n\nhttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=capital&allowed_in_frame=0",
