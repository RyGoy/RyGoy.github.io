   "message": "So, if you go in as the principal and start trying to administrate the Trustee's PERSON / beneficiary, instead of lawfully compelling a court to administrate on behalf of your OWN property, then don't be surprised if a judge decides you're making false claims to the trustee's property by committing fraud and perjury through IMPERSONATING a public entity with authority to administrate juridical PERSONS.\n\nAs the principal you can only control your own property within the law, not with UCC. If you wanna do UCC, set up your own trust.\n\nIf not, then look on the bright side, if the judge decides you mistakenly committed fraud, then you're just another NON COMPIS MENTUS, and thus can't make claim as principal to any of your own assets / property.....thus, that property is considered abandoned cargo for the Judge to administrate on behalf of the \"Trustee\" Corporation.....but are they really your trustee? Nope....they're the juridical person's trustee.\n\nThe proverbial \"You\" is not a beneficiary. You just got tricked into pledging a man's assets for the sake of THEIR beneficiary, a legal fiction.",
