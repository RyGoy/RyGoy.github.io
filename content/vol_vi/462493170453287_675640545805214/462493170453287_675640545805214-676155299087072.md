   "message": "Scott Duncan: Threaten to charge the Union with income tax fraud :D\n\nI have used the following approach with the Australian Tax Office:\n\n'I am more than willing to fulfill any obligations I may have (removes controversy).  \n\nI take my duties very seriously and wish to carry them out honourably, with complete honesty and integrity.\n\nI wish for any and all calculations to be completed correctly and accurately.\n\nSo that I may complete my duties AND may confidently sign the declaration, which threatens serious penalties if not completed correctly, I require the following information from you:\n\nPlease direct me to the specific section in the relevant Act, which defines the term 'income' as I am unable to locate it myself.  I am contacting you, the Deputy Commissioner for Taxation, as you appear to be the expert in this matter, so it should be simple for you to direct me appropriately.\n\nOnce I have a specific definition for the term 'income' from the legislation, then I will be more than willing to complete the forms and sign the declaration.'\n\nTick tock (jeopardy music): 2 years and no reply...and no forms completed by me.\n\nPose a similar question to the union, stating that you are more than willing to pay 'income' tax, once the definition of 'income' has been established from the legislation.  \n\nUntil then, you deny the union the right for them to collect on your behalf, tax on something which has yet to be defined....once you have notified them if they continue to collect, then sure, threaten them with income tax fraud.\n\n(For entertainment purposes only ;-)  )",
