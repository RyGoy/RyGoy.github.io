   "message": "I was working on the Trans Canada Pipelines pumping stations for one summer. Long story short, contractor fucked up with payroll somehow. Pipeline wielders, (they are a closed door union) refused to strike an arc until they were paid what ever it was. Trucks were flying back and forth to town that morning and around noon, arc's were flashing again. Now, if they took that stance with CRA as a group of qualified tradesmen and told companies that they work for hire only, NO DEDUCTIONS, and did not work like they did at the pumping station, CRA would be a long faded nightmare today.",
