   "message": "These companies want no problems with CRA, so to get the tax exemption, you have to apply to CRA. These fucking unions could really help here if they would just wake the fuck up and work for hire, no tax. But, they too, are afraid of CRA, so you pay dues for what? I know about unions, I used to be in one, so no, I don't need the lecture, please. You signed up to the union and their rules and conditions, and the job referral to their rules and conditions, so unless you restricted your signature, you are as they say, owned. Treaty card will not trump your compliant signature on a contract with the union or an employer. (Just my thoughts.) Maybe there is some way THROUGH CRA to get all that money back? I'm not sure.",
