   "message": "hanged vs. hung\nActually, contrary to what people might think, �hanged� is perfectly acceptable as a proper past-tense form of �hang� � when referring to deaths, that is. \nMerriam-Webster says:\nFor both transitive and intransitive senses 1b the past and past participle hung, as well as hanged, is standard. Hanged is most appropriate for official executions <he was to be hanged, cut down whilst still alive�and his bowels torn out � Louis Allen> but hung is also used <gave orders that she should be hung � Peter Quennell>. Hung is more appropriate for less formal hangings <by morning I�ll be hung in effigy � Ronald Reagan>.",
