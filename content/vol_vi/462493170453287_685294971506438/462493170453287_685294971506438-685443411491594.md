   "message": "MORE from the YouTube Comments!\n\nThe DASHING AND HANDSOME ADMIRAL said:\nOh, and the word \"I believe\" negates it being \"proof\". You use weasel-word catchphrases Like \"I believe\" and \"it is my understanding\" and call it \"proof\". You of course lie through ommission there too, don't you Rob?\n\nWell using your logic here is PROOF that it's OK TO KILL Robert Menard: I BELIEVE it's ok to kill Robert Menard, as IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING that killing him would prevent future VICTIMS, and would thus be for the greater good. <---there's my proof! It's just as much \"proof\" as you've provided in this bullshit video!\n\nRob's Lie of ommission about PROOF: Legal proof is something signed and authenticated. Anything else is just evidence. Menard lies through ommission in the fucking title!\n\nConvoluted bullshit pulled out of your ass, isn't \"proof\", and you know it. \n\nALL this man does is lie. He doesn't know how to do anything else. He'll lie through ommission when he can get away with it, and when he can't... he'll just lie to your face.\n\nThat too is not \"belief\" and is something you can \"know for certain\" :D",
