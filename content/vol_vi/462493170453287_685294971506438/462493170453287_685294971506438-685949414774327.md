   "message": "Is it possible that these LEGAL tender notes can only be seen in the LEGAL world, and EXCHANGED between LEGAL persons. ?\n\nAnd when a LEGAL person receives some of these LEGAL notes, in EXCHANGE of whatever it is, that LEGAL persons needs to DECLARE having received some of these LEGAL notes, so that LEGAL person can be taxed accordingly, bcause that is part of the TENDER for LAW, in regards to these \"This Note is Legal Tender\" :/\n\nPer instance, if a MAN decides to do a SEMINAR, about HOW to remove yourself from the LEGAL system, and that same man CHARGES $100 CAD for a seat in that seminar, he definitly have no choice to use the LEGAL person he happen to have to collect these $100 CAD ?\n\nSo he is using the same tool, he is about to demolish to some fucktards that came to this seminar, using their LEGAL person to PAY a LEGAL person with some LEGAL notes that.....wait, I am fucking lost now :(\n\nFuck... :(",
