   "message": "I got this, so far, as an answer :/ From Troll for Truth :D\n\nYes, but it's more than just about using money - if you use any law, you're acting as a person.  The whole system is a \"tender for law.\"  The real you, not a person, can't control anything but what you hold in your hand (if that - really the whole world is in bondage and all you can control is your mind), and you and Scott are \"freedumbers\" like you accuse others of, with your notices, trusts, admiralty law, corporations, etc.  Those things are all under the same rules as everything and everyone else.  There is no legal position that can be claimed that will make you superior to the world.  You're so close.. for a circle-jerking Fathead. :)  You and the rest of Scott's crew just need to put 2 and 2 together and listen to your own advice.",
