   "message": "Void is still my favorite....\nThoughts?\n\nSOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR FOR \nJASON FREDRICK LE BLANC.\nPMB 206 � 204 1440 52 ST NE. \nCalgary, Alberta, T2A-4T8\nREGISTERED MAIL\n\nTHE PROVINCIAL COURT OF ALBERTA\n \nHER MAJESTY THE QUEEN CASE NO: XX\nPLAINTIFF\n\nV\n\nJASON FREDERICK LEBLANC\nDEFENDANT \n\nIT IS MY WISH FOR YOU TO VACATE THE WRONGFUL ISSUE OF A WARRANT AND CUSTODIAL ORDER.\nTHERE HAS BEEN A MISTAKE, HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN, ON GUIDANCE FROM THE CROWN, WRONGFULLY ISSUED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST AND DETENTION OF THE PERSON, I HAPPEN TO HAVE TO THE SOLE AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATING.  WE ATTENDED, IN THE CAPACITY OF SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR, TWO DIFFERENT COURTS, COURT ROOM 508 AND CMO ON APRIL 4TH, 2014, IN HONOR, GOOD FAITH AND INTEGRITY. \nAN ADJOURNMENT WAS SCHEDULED IN BOTH COURTS, TILL MAY 9, 2014 FOR, UPON ARRIVAL AT THE COURTHOUSE ON THE DATE OF MAY 9, 2014. THE DOCKET ONLY SHOWED ONE OF THE COURTS, THE CMO COURT, FOR THE PERSON I HAPPEN TO HAVE. UPON INVESTIGATION IT WAS DISCOVERED, COURT ROOM 508 HAD THE PERSON I HAPPEN TO HAVE, SCHEDULED TO APPEAR ON APRIL 9TH, 2014.  A MONTH EARLIER, AS A RESULT OF THIS WRONGFULLY SCHEDULED DATE, A WRONGFUL WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE ARREST AND DETENTION OF THE PERSON I HAPPEN TO HAVE, IT IS NOT MY FAULT OR ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATION OF THE PERSON, I HAPPEN TO HAVE. IN THE CAPACITY OF SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR, UNDER DURESS AND COERCION, I ATTENDED A MEETING, ON BEHALF OF THE PERSON, I AM THE SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR OF AND WAS TOLD, THE PROBATION OFFICE HAS A POLICY TO EXECUTE ANY OUTSTANDING MATTERS. I WISHED TO REMAIN IN HONOR, I DECLINED THE OFFER, ON BEHALF OF THE PERSON I HAPPEN TO HAVE AND VACATED THE PREMISES IMMEDIATELY, AS MISTAKEN IDENTITY, SEEMS TO BE A CAUSE FOR LOSS OF LIBERTY TO ME, THIS INCIDENT JEOPARDIZED THE SECURITY, LIBERTY AND LIFE OF THE PERSON I HAPPEN TO HAVE, AS SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR.  \nI AM THE SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR OF THE JASON FREDRICK LE BLANC TRUST, CREATED BY THE VITAL STATISTICS DEPARTMENT OF ALBERTA, AND DESCRIBED IN AN EVENT AS A 'RECORD OF LIVE BIRTH'.  THE SURETY BOND DEPOSITED INTO THE COURT WAS CREATED AUGUST XX, 1964, DERIVED FROM SAID LIVE BIRTH RECORD, SHOWN IN EXHIBIT 1  (BIRTH CERTIFICATE REGISTRATION NUMBER:XXXXXXXXXX)\nTO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS THE SURETY FOR ALL MATTERS CONCERNING PUBLIC ACCOUNTS.  \n WHY WOULD WE HAVE BEEN BE GIVEN IT TO HAVE? \nI HAPPEN TO HAVE THIS PIECE OF PAPER, CALLED A BIRTH CERTIFICATE. I WAS TOLD IT IS A FOUNDATION DOCUMENT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\nI WAS GIVEN A BIRTH CERTIFICATE WITH A NAME THAT IS NOT MINE, WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN OF FOURTEEN YEARS OLD, BELOW THE AGE OF CONSENT.  I WAS NEVER INSTRUCTED ON WHAT IT IS FOR AND TOLD NOT TO USE IT FOR IDENTIFICATION.  IT USED TO STATE ON THESE BIRTH CERTIFICATES:\n NOT TO BE USED FOR IDENTIFICATION.\nTO USE FOUNDATION DOCUMENTS FOR IDENTIFICATION IS PROHIBITED BY THE VITAL STATISTICS ACT.  HOW CAN I POSSIBLY BE SOMETHING THAT IN REALITY, IS JUST A PIECE OF PAPER?\n IF NOT TO BE USED FOR IDENTIFICATION, HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT IDENTIFY ME WITH THESE DOCUMENTS?\nTHERE IS A MISTAKE IN THE STYLE, FORM AND SPELLING OF THE NAME OF THE PERSON, i HAPPEN TO HAVE, AS SHOWN BY EXHIBIT 1. I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE LEGAL PERSON NAMED JASON FREDERICK LEBLANC IS. IN REVIEWING THE RECORDS OF THIS OTHER PERSON, WHOM I HAVE BEEN MISTAKENLY IDENTIFIED AS, THIS MISTAKE HAS BEEN REPEATED DUE TO UNDUE INFLUENCE,  SINCE 1981, WHEN I WAS FIRST MISTAKENLY CHARGED AS THIS LEGAL PERSON, AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN, WHO HAS A DIFFERENT NAME THEN ON THE GOVERNMENT PROPERTY OF THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE.  AS THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENT ARE THE ONLY SIGNATORY PARTY, WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE THAT THE SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR IS THE SURETY IN THIS MATTER?\nIN THE MATTER OF SURETY FOR THE LEGAL NAME THERE IS A MISTAKE, THE SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR, HAS BEEN INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED AS THE ACCUSED.                  \nIF I AND/OR PERSON AND/OR FRIENDS OR ANYONE ACTING IN MY INTERESTS HAS GIVEN YOU REASON TO BELIEVE THAT I AM SURETY FOR THIS MATTER THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE, PLEASE FORGIVE ME.\nI AM NOT A�YOU�; I AM ME, IN THE CAPACITY OF SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR.\nI RESPECTFULLY ASK BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO ATTACH ANY NAME DERIVED FROM ANY PUBLIC DOCUMENT TO ME?\n\nTHE SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR, WILL NOT BUY BACK ANY PUBLIC DEBT BUT WILL DISCHARGE ALL PUBLIC DEBT, ARE NOT WE ENTITLED TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE SECURITY OF THE PERSON?\n\nTHIS NOTICE IS INTENDED TO CORRECT ANY MISTAKES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE.\n\nI RESPECTFUL DECLINE YOUR OFFER AND WISH FOR IMMEDIATE DISCHARGE, TO CLOSE ANY AND ALL OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS WITH THE CROWN.\n\nAUTHORIZED BY:  \nThe Sole Authorized Administrator Seal.\nThe Duly Authorized corporate trustee seal.",
