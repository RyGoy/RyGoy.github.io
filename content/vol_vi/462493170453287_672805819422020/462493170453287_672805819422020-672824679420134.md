   "message": "One of those contracts went south and  I held back footage and equipment until the bill was paid.  Not realizing this was theft. I was thinking security for costs. I was wrong. So I got a theft under $5000 charge. This court day is coming in August.  I was stopped back in febuary and went into default mode, and landed in remand with a weekend to kill... 5 days actually. While I was in city cells, I was doing my best to  explain the corp trust, me officer thing and well... obstruction..\nI really do not want to go to court anymore. so I am doing what I can to administrate it properly.",
