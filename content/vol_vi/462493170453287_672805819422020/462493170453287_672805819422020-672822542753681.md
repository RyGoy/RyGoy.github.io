   "message": "We do not do free man here and it bothered me.  \n4 years ago, I had a catastrophic event.  I went a little bat shit.\nat the tail end of it, I had a incident where, I caused some property damage.  I was arrested and taken downtown and given a year own recognizance with conditions, a peace bond.  I met all the conditions except for one. They put me in breach.  A while later I discovered this forum. I was relieved to have some answers, finally. So I had a warrant for the breach.  Since then I formed a corp, have gotten back on my feet a little and have some contracts here and there.",
