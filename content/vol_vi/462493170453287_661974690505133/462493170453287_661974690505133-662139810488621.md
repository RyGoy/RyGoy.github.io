   "message": "You have the main point. I have some minor suggestions.\n\nIs it a letter, or a notice? They are not the same, so decide how  you want to communicate, via letter, or notice. \n\nInstead of using the word \"I\", I would use \"SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for ELIJAH DAVID WEAKLEY\".\n\nSometimes you use the word \"we\". Who is \"we\"? :/\n\nSuggested  <<I have accepted the INCHOATE INSTRUMENTS referred to as STUBS that have been provided by your office and returned such for the DISCHARGE of the DEBT via the SURETY of the PERSON AND/OR TAXPAYER AND/OR RESIDENT ELIJAH WEAKLEY. \n\nAs the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for XXXX, I completed the instrument in GOOD FAITH.  Should there be a defect in the INSTRUMENT, please send it back immediately along with specific instructions as how to complete the INSTRUMENT for DISCHARGE and settlement of the account.>>\n\nJust some suggestions, best wishes!",
