   "message": "DO NOT THANK ME. You serve an agenda. Nothing more.\n\nFor each of you thanking me, there are 100 who think I should be killed. \n\nI'm NOT doing this because I'm a \"nice guy\".  You are just seeing a TINY part of what I am doing/building globally. \n\nYou have your FIRST reward (more comes later) but that creates a debt. Who is surety? Certainly not YOU. \n\n\"Believers\" will pay the price. Not you. The problem is that people you know are still \"believers\". THEY will pay it.\n\nYou serve MY agenda by freeing yourself... Like the Dragon Lady on Game of Thrones (The only interesting thread in the story, the rest is all just killy and rapey shit).",
