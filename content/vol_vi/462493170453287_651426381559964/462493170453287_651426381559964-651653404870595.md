   "message": "I guess this means you're officially the \"nice one\" now, Pete! Whew, it's about time they finally stopped whining to me. I guess being \"the girl\" made me the Complaints Department by default. Slow learners, these \"wronged\" folks, it's taken a little time for them to figure out just how futile that was. :D\n\nBeing \"the girl\" does NOT automatically mean that I will grant you a sympathetic ear! If you're wrong, you're wrong. \n\nIf you think you can play on my \"feminine, emotional side\", you're even...wronger! :p",
