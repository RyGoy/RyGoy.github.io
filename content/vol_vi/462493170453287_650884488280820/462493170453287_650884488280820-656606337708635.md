   "message": "So speaking of stupidity i've been asked to be personal security for a 2016 presidential candidate. I said yes because its free everything and as I work my ass off in real life I enjoy free shit. Im supposed to start on the 2nd of next month he will be speaking after the race at Taladega. So I know presidents take orders and are sold to the highest bidder. I've spoke with this man on several occasions and his hearts is in the right place I just don't think he really gets it yet.  Being a bullet dummy for anything is pretty stupid though.",
