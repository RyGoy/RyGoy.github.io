   "message": "OK so this \"dude\" Joe Bucks. Any one here heard of him? He has popped up in a group and is claiming to use Winston Shrout stuff \"with success\". I was discussing the person NOT being MINE and that the party with surety is identified on the instrument, as some one was using the charter (of CANADA) as some form of defence. \"Hey I have rights because the charter says so and you are infringing on them.\" sort of thing. So he then claims- \"Discharge will come back and bite you when Gold and Silver comes back into fashion and it looks like it will. I only know Setoff because I know I'm no fiction.\nGood luck to you\" Joe Bucks. I ask if he could be more specific and he points AGAIN to a Winston seminar.",
