I said yes because its free everything and as I work my ass off in real life I enjoy free shit. Im supposed to start on the 2nd of next month he will be speaking after the race at Taladega. So I know presidents take orders and are sold to the highest bidder. I've spoke with this man on several occasions and his hearts is in the right place I just don't think he really gets it yet. Being a bullet dummy for anything is pretty stupid though.\"\n\nYou are going to work for these idiots?",
