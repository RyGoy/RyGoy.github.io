   "message": "In Canada is this incorrect? \"We the People\" is not, and never has been, us individually, it is us as a whole, a collective, as represented by a parliament. That is why it is said the parliament is sovereign, the parliament is \"We the People\", and gains it's authority from the electoral consent of the governed, not by individual consent, or royal decree, or the will of god. We have a \"Sovereign\", but she doesn't represent any authority or any sovereign power here. In an independant nation, the authority behind government in Canada comes from majority rule, same as in every other democratic system.\nThe monarch has merely been a ceremonial provision since the magna charter and the subsequent creation of parliament. The notion of royal sovereignty was removed with a sword to the kings throat, and given to a parliament of the people. This was where the notion of parliamentary sovereignty was born. Assent from the monarch today is merely a formality, not some sort of nessessary permission or something. The parliament of this sovereign independant nation still holds the sword to her throat, and it is this parliament of the people that holds the sovereignty.",
