   "message": "Hang on...do citizens exist???\n\nLet me paraphrase Marc Stevens...citizens pledge their allegiance to the state in exchange for protection...However, the various supreme courts have ruled that the state does not owe a duty of protection to the public.\n\nErgo, if the state cannot/is not obligated to provide protection, then doesn't it follow that there now an invalid contract as one party is not fulfilling its obligations?\n\nConsequently, isn't the concept of citizens/citizenship also invalid, thus removing the right to search the vehicle, in much the same way they can't search Santa Claus, the Easter bunny or Jeebus' vehicle?\n\nIf this is a shitstain pulled from the dictionary of my arse, please forgive me and delete the offending post",
