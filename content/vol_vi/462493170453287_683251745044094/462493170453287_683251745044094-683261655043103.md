   "message": "The debt was ACCEPTED by the ADMINISTRATOR, for the DRAWER......I accepted the DEBT, not the bill :/\n\nNow, on presentment of that bill to Bank of Canada, they have to ACCEPT its discharge.....by, I guess, STAMPING it with some sort of stamps, and maybe then, 8750432 CANADA INC can deposit the bill of exchange in its bank account ?\n\nI am just going logic here.....\n\nSo your question to them would have been only: How do we PRESENT that Bill of Exchange to Bank of Canada. :D\n\nMaybe your question was too questionable :D",
