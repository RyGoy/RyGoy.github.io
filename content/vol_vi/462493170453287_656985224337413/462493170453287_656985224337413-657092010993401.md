   "message": "Here it is Pete \n\nApril 22, 2014\n\nTO: Glenn Trueira\n    c/o PMLP\n201 Warren St. Ext.\nPeabody, MA 01960\n\nRe: Account number 968219 Meter number 34520\nBills of Exchange\n\nRegistered Mail #:\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED / WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n\nGlenn Trueira,\n\nYou have received two completed Bills of Exchange each with an instruction letter for this Account (March 26, 2014 and April 16, 2014) evidenced by the two signed Domestic Return Receipts indicating acceptance.  It seems as though neither were credited to the Account.\n\nYou, Glenn Trueira, are now DEMANDING more payment but I have clearly said, I do not wish to buy your Public Debt.  There has been no Notice of Dishonor, nor Notice that the Bills had a defect.\n\nIt is YOUR obligation to PRESENT that completed instrument to the Drawee, the Federal Reserve Bank.  If you do not, it will be a dishonor and relieve CHRIS and The Federal Reserve Bank from that PUBLIC DEBT.\n\nAs I have asserted before, the SURETY for CHRISTOPHER E SCHULTE is the State of MASSACHUSETTS, enclosed is the valuable consideration (Birth Certificate) with their signature on it. \n\nWith integrity and sincerity,\n\nBy: __________________________\nSole Authorized Administrator and Beneficiary of CHRISTOPHER E. SCHULTE birth registration #: 492xxxxx\n\nWithout Recourse, All rights reserved\n\nTAKE NOTICE:  If I need to ADMINISTRATE this matter again because you are acting in bad faith and/or have already spent that money before I made a decision if I wanted to buy the debt or not, I will have no other choice than to CHARGE you.  IF YOU CUT THE SERVICE, I WILL HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO ADMINISTRATE THIS MATTER AS AN ILLEGAL ACT ON YOUR PART BECAUSE THE DEBT HAS BEEN PROPERLY ADMINISTRATED.",
