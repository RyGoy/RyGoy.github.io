   "message": "I have an interesting experience to share. I keep buying back the utility debt because I don't want it shut off. However, I was just experimenting and I sent a remittance in for double the amount due (They let you fill in these BoE's) and surprisingly I recieve a refund check for exactly half the remittance. Are they playing ball with me because I inadvertently allowed them to continue to twin the revenue stream?",
