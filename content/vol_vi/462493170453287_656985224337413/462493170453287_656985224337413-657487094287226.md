   "message": "An affidavit or affirmation is a statement of facts made by a person under oath. Generally, this is the means by which the parties or their witnesses submit evidence to the court during the hearing of an interlocutory application (or other kinds of application).\n\nA Catholic or a Christian should make affidavits. People of other religious beliefs or no religious belief should make affirmations.\n\n:P\n\nhttp://www.hkclic.org/en/topics/civilCase/commencement_of_trial/q2.shtml",
