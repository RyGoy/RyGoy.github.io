   "message": "Here is what I am working on: (still a draft)\n\nYou have received two completed Bills of Exchange for this Account (March 26, 2014 and April 16, 2014), each with an instruction letter.  It seems as though neither were credited to the Account.\n\nThere has been no Notice of Dishonor, nor Notice that the Bills had a defect.  If there was a Notice of Dishonor or if there is a defect in the Instruments please send Notice so the matter(s) can be addressed.  [Exhibit A, attached, is a copy of the instructions for the last Bill that was completed and sent back.]\n\nYou have sent a DEMAND FOR PAYMENT and based on my experience with PMLP; a SHUT OFF NOTICE will follow this.  I wish to remain honorable and help settle this matter.  \n\nFirst, payment has been presented and accepted.  I have received two signed Receipts indicating acceptance.  You, Glenn Trueira, are now DEMANDING more payment and I am not sure why.  Would you please tell me why you are making these demands?\n\nWith integrity and sincerity,\n\nBy: __________________________\nSole Authorized Administrator and Beneficiary of CHRISTOPHER E.
