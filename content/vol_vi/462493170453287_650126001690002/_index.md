   "message": "OK, so I know that filing tax returns is part of my duties as the sole authorized administrator for ELIJAH WEAKLEY. I know that I need to get a BILL in order to administrate this debt. So I plan to file and send an invoice for my time and efforts spent filling out these forms etc. Here is the letter I am planning to send with the filing/invoice. Any critique from the group and the Admiral is much appreciated.\n\nIllinois tax criminals\n666 ripoff road\nShithole, IL 99122\n\n         Dear sir or madam,\nI have completed your tax forms to the best of my ability for the PERSON/TAXPAYER ELIJAH WEAKLEY. I am not qualified in any way to act as a tax collector and therefore accept no liability for errors. Enclosed is an invoice for my time and efforts required to complete the paperwork as being forced to perform unpaid work is slavery/indentured servitude and that is illegal. I do not completely understand these tax forms so I am not sure what the tax liability is for this PERSON/TAXPAYER. As such I require a BILL be sent for the amount due containing a coupon/voucher or other instrument by which remedy is achieved. If you would be so kind as to include instructions for executing the instrument so the debt may be discharged via the SURETY of the PERSON/TAXPAYER in question that would be greatly appreciated. I eagerly await your timely response as it is very important to me that this matter is settled for ELIJAH WEAKLEY. \n\nWith love and regards,\n\nFor:\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\nSole Authorized Administrator",
