   "message": "I wouldnt say im not qualified.\nI dont do stuff im not qualifies to do, as i dont want any surety in such matter. You could have hired an accountant and rebill whatever he charges to the govt. I myself dont do the paperwork.\n\nI wouldnt mention the surety neither at this point... Just get your remittance vouchers, stamp the shit out of them, and send a new letter along explaining heres the bills of exchange and in case you dont know what to do i graciously instruct you on how to administrate them. Any further assistance required from me will be charged at \"whatever hourly rate floats your ship\"...",
