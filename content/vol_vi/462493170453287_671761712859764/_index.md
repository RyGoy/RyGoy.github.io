   "message": "I am new to this group and I have a question...\n\nOn June 9th i am to appear in court.  this date is only to plead guilty or non guilty for 7 alleged fraud charges from CRA amounting to 3 million.\n\nI have been reading these files and am coming to more understanding of who I am and who i  am not.  \n\nMy first question is how should I approach the courts on the 9th if its a \"plead guilty or not guilty\"?  I am going to file into the courts the NOTICE OF MISTAKE but just wondering what more should I do right now specifically on that date.\n\nthanks",
