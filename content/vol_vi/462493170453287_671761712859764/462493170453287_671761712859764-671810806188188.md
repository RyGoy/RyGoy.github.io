   "message": "Pete if I was guilty I would not be asking for help..just so you know I DID NOT STEAL a dime. That is not how I am, but as you don't know me and see all that CRA is telling or saying I did with NO proof, and my former lawyer said to me that CRA doesn't have proof and does not understand why they keep coming. He did say a few times that they could walk away from this just before court as they don't have evidence that I did anything wrong other the selling it.  Neil Friesen",
