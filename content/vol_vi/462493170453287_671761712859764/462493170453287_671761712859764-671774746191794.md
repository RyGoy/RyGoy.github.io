   "message": "The following is from the lawyer; Case Overview\n \nIt is alleged One World United Inc. (OWU) created and marketed a false tax write-off scheme.  Participants contributed an amount in cash to OWU.  In return, the participant received an ``invoice`` for business losses equal to four times the amount of cash contributed.   The participant could then use these losses on their individual income tax return to reduce their total income for the year, and if the losses exceeded their income, they could also carry the losses back up to 3 years or save them for future years.   In addition, the ``invoice`` could also be used to claim a GST refund.  Participants were attracted to this scheme because it would provide a tax write-off giving an immediate return of the initial investment through tax refunds, plus there was a promise of a lucrative return on the investment in the future.\n \nJeff Dyck is the President and sole shareholder of One World United Inc.  It is alleged that he actively designed, promoted and oversaw the implementation and day to day activities of the alleged scheme, referred to in OWU records as the �Tax Incentive (TI)� program and later the �Business Builder Affiliate (BBA)� program.\n \nNeil Friesen is the proprietor of �Neil Friesen & Associates� an �alternative investment provider�.  It is alleged that he was the main sales agent of OWU and also took part in the design of the alleged scheme.  For each participant Neil Friesen referred to OWU he received a commission between 10% and 35% of the participant�s cash contribution.\n \nIt is alleged that Jeff Dyck, in his role as President and CEO of OWU, was aware that the invoices issued to participants contained false information and amounted to false statements.  It is further alleged that he was aware that the invoices would allow the participants to claim false deductions on their Income Tax and GST returns.\n \nIt is alleged that Neil Friesen was aware that the invoices issued to participants did not meet the Canada Revenue Agency�s requirements for Income Tax and GST deductibility and amounted to false statements.  It is further alleged that he was aware that the invoices would allow the participants to claim false deductions on their Income Tax and GST returns.\n \nQuantum\n \nThe Audit Division of the Winnipeg Tax Services Office has adjusted the tax returns of all individuals who participated in OWU.  The results of the federal tax, provincial tax and interest reductions/refunds as a result of claiming false OWU invoices as deductible expenses/input tax credits are:\n \nIncome Tax",
