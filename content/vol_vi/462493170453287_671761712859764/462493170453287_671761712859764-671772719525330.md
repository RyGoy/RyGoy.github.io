   "message": "AIKINS\nLAW\n\nRe: Your Charges under the Income Tax Act and Excise Tax Act \nI attended what I am beginning to believe is the last Case Management Conference (\"CMC\") on\nyour behalf on Wednesday, April 30, 2014 at 1:00 p.m..\nAt the CMG I was unable to confirm with the Court my continued representation of you in this\nmatter. I did indicate to the Court that we had met and discussed the defence of the case and the\nissue of my retainer should the matter go forward to preliminary inquiry and trial.\nIn the course of the CMC the Crown did confirm that upon a guilty plea by each of you, the\nposition on sentencing would be a 2 year conditional sentence (house arrest) and a fine of $3.3\nmillion for each of you.\nAt the CMC I indicated that I did not believe there was an appetite on your part to plead guilty\nand pay the fine of $3.3 million each. Nevertheless, I informed the Court that I would convey\nthe Crown's position to you for your consideration.\nI was unable to properly discuss the mechanics of the preliminary inquiry and what agreements\nmight be made in order to cause for a more efficient use of time at the hearing, because the issue\nof my retainer remains unresolved.",
