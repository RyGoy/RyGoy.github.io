   "message": "The last time I \"got in\" I got burned and at 56 reproducing myself once, which I consider fair as everybody should do if they feel so inclined and blah blah blah if it goes wrong and DA STATE has to pick up the pieces; which it is straining at the leash to do in all CROWN juristictions because of the lucrative grants available; anyway WE (God save Da Queen) do tend to succumb in general to the percieved law (I don't mean you of course as it is quite obvious to me that you're nobody's fool when it comes to protecting you and yours). That all said I am a sovereign as stated in the most important document ever produced in this part of the world and furthermore I only have a passive respect for those (politicians and pigs) who recognise the Sovereign Constitution of ï¿½ire, the only bonafide and the original of the five existing; anybody else can fuck off.  Google the Proclaimation of 1916 and tell me where i have to be Democratic or Socialist or Communist? They can all fuck off I'm Sovereign and that document proves it so the Queen can fick off as the Government of ireland Act was passed by the Crown in 1922 but according to the Sovereign Constitution of 1919 ratified on Independance day january 21st it takes a two thirds majority to pass any act.",
