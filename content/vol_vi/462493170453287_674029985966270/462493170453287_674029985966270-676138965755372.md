   "message": "Hmmmmm...a prayer and a cold hard stare...FREEDUMB!!!!\n\nSeriously, leaving the AQUILAE seal on the document?!?\n\nThat's gotta fall into the dumb as dogshit negligence category...I doubt the guy has sufficient intelligence to have done it deliberately, so there doesn't appear to be any intent to commit fraud.\n\nEasy fixed though, if he's claiming the jurisdiction and/or protection of the AQUILAE Trust, maybe he wishes AQUILAE to lien the person on his behalf, claim any value from the matter as AQUILAE assets, then toss his dumb-ass overboard & feed him to the fish!\n\nSeems like a WIN/WIN to me ;-)",
