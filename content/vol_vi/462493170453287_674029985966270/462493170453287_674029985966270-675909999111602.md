A corrupted view of freedom based in mass ignorance of what real freedom requires.\nThe distorted view of the majority population in the United States, who believe that it is not necessary to be intelligent and informed in order to remain free. The concept that unchecked politicians and Multi-National Corporations and NGO's will protect individual civil liberties and not impose various forms of slavery on their subjects. Not knowing the difference between freedom, and fascism is a common trait of lovers of freedumb.  :D\n\nhttp://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=freedumb",
