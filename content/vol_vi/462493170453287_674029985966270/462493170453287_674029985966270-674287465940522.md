   "message": "GOOD!\n\nThat will be the next tactic they use. Discrediting MY work by using Free-Dumb bastardizations as examples.\n\nNEW people will be mislead, and will miss EVERYTHING I have taught you so far.\n\nFREE-DUMBERS MEAN YOU HARM! ALL of you with a clue will agree; If anyone leads you AWAY from what I'm saying, THEY MEAN YOU HARM!\n\nThat's why it's such a risky gambit to do that. EVENTUALLY the truth comes out, and those who dismiss what I teach as OPCA/FREE-DUMB crap, don't think about what happens if I turn out to be right. They will immediately confront those who mislead them in the first place, and violence tends to ensue.",
