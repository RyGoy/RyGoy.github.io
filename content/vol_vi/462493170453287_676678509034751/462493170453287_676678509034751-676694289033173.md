   "message": "I took a red pill.  And I journeyed in here.  Heard there was truth here, and no BS.  I have done a lot of research to wake up.  I suppose you could say I am mid way or at the end of Matrix reloaded.  Seems out of all I've been reviewing, Karl Lentz- National Liberty Alliance-Dean Clifford-OPPT are my top 4.  I'm sure there is a 5 in my mind somewhere.  Was just referred to Creditors in Commerce.  I'm like all over the place...in the ditches, trees, flying in the air, caves, underwater looking for an effective remedy.  I got a tick tick tick in my ear, awakened; however, I'm in reaction mode right now on with a couple heat seeking bullets flying around me.  Knowing what I know now....I just can't consent or go back to sleep.  Thanks for adding me to the group.",
