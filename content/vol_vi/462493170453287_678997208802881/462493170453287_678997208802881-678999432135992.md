   "message": "Next we have CAPITUS DICKUS ERECTUS! Yes! the stupid fuck likes to pick and choose the things he listens to here!\n\nAllow me to quote from one of my recent articles:\n\n\"Your average FREE-DUMBER will say your capitalized name is a \"CORPORATION\", and will attempt to sound smart by saying Latin phrases like, \"Capitus Dickus Erectus\", or some other such nonsense that has no bearing on reality.  The case and spelling of your name is the direct result of administrative policy - and nothing more.\"\n\nDean Otf Kory, which do you think is true? What I write, or the Free-Dumb bullshit you post?",
