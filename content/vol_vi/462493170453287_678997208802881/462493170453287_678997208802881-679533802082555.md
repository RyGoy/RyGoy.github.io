   "message": "COPYPASTA from Dean Kory:\n\nI have recently removed myself from Scott Duncan's \"The Tender for Law\" group because of criticisms against me for posting \"Bad information\" and several people there claim that I have to take full responsibility for some of the inaccurate details of all that I post and/or re-post. I choose to devote all my Facebook postings to teaching people important information concerning their rights and about the sad state of affairs with today's DE FACTO GOVERNMENT and policing, and suggest ways to bring about positive changes and I welcome vibrant debate, however some people are just focused on arguing and character assassination...I forgive them...I see a lot of this type of thing throughout the \"Freedom movement\" on line. So I agreed to post a disclaimer of sorts just to clear the air and assure you good people that my intention is never to mislead or misinform anyone...\".DO NOT TAKE ALL THAT I POST AS GOSPEL, I SOMETIMES SHARE OTHER PEOPLES INFORMATION WITHOUT FACT CHECKING AND DO SO ONLY TO PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU NEED TO SCREEN,CHECK AND EVALUATE FOR YOURSELF!\"...Scott Duncan's information is solid and fact checked, tried tested and true and \"The Tender for Law\" is the best source of information I have found for anyone wanting to learn the more complex ways the government has deceived you and ways to circumvent them .I will continue to post/re-post and share as I have always done...nobody can tell me what I can or cannot share or the manner in which I choose to stir up lively debate...be cautious of anyone trying to harness the free exchange of information and the information itself!",
