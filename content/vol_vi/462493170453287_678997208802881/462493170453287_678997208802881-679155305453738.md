Parking Tickets or something?\n\nCeit beats the crap out of someone on the street, she back on duty the next day... and that was with TWO MONTH'S TRAINING and coaching from Lou Manotti.\n\nYOU have a \"conviction\".\n\nCeit has a \"Sorry to have bothered you, please don''t hurt us\".\n\nWHICH one of you is MOST qualified to speak on this subject?",
