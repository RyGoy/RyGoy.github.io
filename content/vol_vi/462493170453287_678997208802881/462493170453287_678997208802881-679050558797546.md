   "message": "So you throw this information out there, without knowing if it's bullshit or not. Now everyone who follows your page can join you in \"testing in the real world\", with \"real consequences\" for ALL of them. That really sounds like a good thing to you? \n\nPeople who actually ARE paying attention and learning here, are having increasingly more trouble with the courts. They're being ignored, muzzled, and talked over, and a big part of it is because of the ludicrous Free-Dumb BULLSHIT that other people are doing. We ALL get lumped into that group. \n\nHell, when I was being processed, the cop only asked me two questions. He tried to trick me into giving details on the incident, and when that failed, he left me in the cell and only came back to ask \"Hey, are you one of those \"Freemen\"?\"",
