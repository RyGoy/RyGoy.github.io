   "message": "As a pretty new member to the group, and still at the \"Reading All the Posts\" stage (as per Pete's instructions), I would like to mention that idea Ceit Butler spoke about where posts are personal endorsements holds quite true to me. If I see everything here is vetted and found to be true, then I start to trust the content more. That also carries over to the personal pages of the members here as well. Like it or not, those of you that post on here regularly will get \"followed\".     I found this group via something Scott wrote, that was reposted by Dean Otf Kory, that was again reposted by someone else. I had seen stuff that Dean posted before and I often dismissed it. When Scott Duncan's work got reposted, it struck something in me, and made me want to trace it back and find out more because it smacks of TRUTH. Now that I am here though, I am still sifting through all the older posts..... Did you guys know that you have some threads on here with like 1400 comments?!?!? :)",
