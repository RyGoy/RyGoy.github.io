   "message": "As I walk through the \"Valley of Dunce\" that is THE TENDER FOR LAW, I go through all your profiles.  I don't want anybody to think that I'm actually interested in anything you have to say.  I most certainly am not!  \n\nI look for the profiles that mention \"spirits\", \"God\", \"Jesus\", and I look for words indicating a secondary level of stupidity, like \"Strawman\", etc.  \n\nI do this to weed out the stealth-theists.  Piece-of-shit Christians like to think they can hold onto their Jesus-myth, and also use what I teach.  They can't, and the only thing they have to contribute is lies.\n\nThis is why theists are banned on sight.\n\nBut that's not what this post is for.\n\nNo...this is to introduce a new TENDER FOR LAW feature.\n\nIt will be \"The Admiral inspects your profile\".  I shall select profiles at random and will point out the bullshit.  The very first profile featured shall be that of Dean Kory.  Mr. Kory is pseudo-famous for hanging out in the Fortress of Remand; and he has a page full of FREE-DUMB shit.  Let's go take a look! :D\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dean.kory",
