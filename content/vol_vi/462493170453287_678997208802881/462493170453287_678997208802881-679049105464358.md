   "message": "\"Armchair revolutionaries\". And you know me SO well, you are able to label me as such? See, I was in court last year as well but since I never got caught up in any Free-Dumb Bullshit, my case was easily resolved. By listening to Lou and Scott. \n\nI didn't spend any time in jail, I spent minimal time in a holding cell before my very first appearance. Submitted the CORRECT paperwork, said the RIGHT things, and had the case dismissed.\n\nYou really shouldn't jump to conclusions like that, making sweeping declarations about complete strangers.",
