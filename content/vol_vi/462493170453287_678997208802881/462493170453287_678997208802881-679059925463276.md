I do, and I know that the things that he posts on HIS page, he will have fully read and investigated before posting, so I know that I can TRUST the information to be accurate.\n\nIf Scott suddenly started posting articles on \"Strawmen\", \"Chemtrails\", and \"How to Decalcify your Pineal Gland\", people would TRUST that, because the fact that HE posted it lends HIS credibility to the information.\n\nSee how that works, and how that becomes a problem if you're posting inacurate info?",
