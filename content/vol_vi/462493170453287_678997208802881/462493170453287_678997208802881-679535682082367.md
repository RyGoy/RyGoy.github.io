   "message": "I have recently removed myself from Scott Duncan's \"The Tender for Law\" group because of criticisms against me for posting \"Bad information\" and several people there claim that I have to take full responsibility for some of the inaccurate details of all that I post and/or re-post. I choose to devote all my Facebook postings to teaching people important information concerning their rights and about the sad state of affairs with today's DE FACTO GOVERNMENT and policing, and suggest ways to bring about positive changes and I welcome vibrant debate, however some people are just focused on arguing and character assassination...I forgive them...I see a lot of this type of thing throughout the \"Freedom movement\" on line. So I agreed to post a disclaimer of sorts just to clear the air and assure you good people that my intention is never to mislead or misinform anyone...\".DO NOT TAKE ALL THAT I POST AS GOSPEL, I SOMETIMES SHARE OTHER PEOPLES INFORMATION WITHOUT FACT CHECKING AND DO SO ONLY TO PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU NEED TO SCREEN,CHECK AND EVALUATE FOR YOURSELF!\"...Scott Duncan's information is solid and fact checked, tried tested and true and \"The Tender for Law\" is the best source of information I have found for anyone wanting to learn the more complex ways the government has deceived you and ways to circumvent them .I will continue to post/re-post and share as I have always done...nobody can tell me what I can or cannot share or the manner in which I choose to stir up lively debate...be cautious of anyone trying to harness the free exchange of information and the information itself!\n\nTony Boutros Dean, please define what you mean by \"character assassination\". Would you consider exposing truths about people backed by evidence as character assassination?\nDean Otf Kory You don't have to be a full blow shill to ruin the free exchange of information...\n\nAmy E Smart Scott Duncan is rude and arrogant.\n\nDean Otf Kory not at all Tony...thats responsibe reporting...I just don't feel I should be held to account for the validity of information when sharing posts from others...pick apart the info from the one who created it...I share everything and let the cards fall where they may!\n\nDean Otf Kory \"Scott Duncan is rude and arrogant\"..yes he is and that's a good personality trait needed for the job he has at hand!\nNOTE: THIS COMMENT WAS EDITED FROM -  Scott Duncan is rude and arrogant. TO WHAT NOW APPEARS ABOVE.\n\nAmy E Smart A real sovereign shows love and peace!\n\nJ Conrad Steele Dean you do the best you can with the info at hand. And sharing another persons view is good, it gets dialogue going and may spur a big discovery for the person reading the post.\n\nDean Otf Kory Thanks J\n\nDavid Purple Hayes .....been friends a week or a little over , please do not stop the post......I need the info , as an American Veteran I want to say thank you !....\n\nDean Otf Kory I will continue to post until they kill me for doing so! lol!\n\nLorraine George keep on doin Dean,...I was \"mindful\"( when writing my affidavits) of a number of things you said when you visited. All it takes is 1 thing that turns the dial.\n\nDean Otf Kory your a wonderful woman Lorraine!...I was happy to help and am still here for you whatever you need.",
