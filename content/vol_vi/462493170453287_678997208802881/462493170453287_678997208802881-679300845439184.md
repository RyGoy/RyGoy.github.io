   "message": "There is no \"ideology\" here. We deal in REALITY.\n\nThis removes confusion. If it conflicts with REALITY, it's wrong.\n\nSimple, huh?\n\nIf it's hard you're doing it wrong.\n\nDean Otf Kory is a cautionary tale of what happens when you try mix free-dumb shit with REALITY.\n\nIf I take a shit on your next meal, you wouldn't think to eat it simply because it still has the same nutritional value. Shitting on what I teach by including free-dumb shit is doing just that.\n\nFree-Dumbers shit on the REAL answers I provide here.\n\nI explain quite clearly what the Birth Certificate is. Dean, still spews crap like \"Capitis Diminutio Maxima\" (Which hasn't existed for 500 years, an appears in NO ENGLISH LAW).\n\nPete Daoust apparently (According to Dean) \"Asks some interesting questions\". Where do you think he got that from? He's WAY past that point. He poses those questions to TEACH YOU.",
