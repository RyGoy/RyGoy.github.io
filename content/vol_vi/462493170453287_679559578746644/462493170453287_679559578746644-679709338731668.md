   "message": "ok just to be sure I do get it, let me reconfirm....Example: Utility company\n\n1. Trustee corp deals with the bill that the utility company sends to GAIL BLACKMAN\n2. It's their responsibility to \"pay\" the debt.\n3. So they can \"pay\" it and bill GAIL BLACKMAN  for the amount who will then administrate that bill of exchange and return it to the trustee corp complete,\n4. The corp then takes the completed bill of exchange and sends it to the bank of canada\n5. The bank of canada will then send an equivalent amount of money of exchange to the trustee corp, and this will balance the trustee corps books \n6. An alternative is that the trustee corp could bill GAIL BLACKMAN for the amount of the utility bill have her complete the bill of exchange...send it off to the bank of canada and pay the utility bill once they have received the money of exchange from the bank of canada?",
