   "message": "Alright... Recap because I like to make sure I get it right :\nThese HQ AGENTS probably dont even have a clue who Pierre Daoust vs PIERRE DAOUST really is, and it actually doesnt matter... One is an owner and the other's a customer, but even if, I'm pretty sure that to most of them, their OWNER is ALSO a CUSTOMER which they got used to not seeing as an OWNER at all, and even they dont understand the difference in how they write the name... Since you clearly declared Pierre Daoust an HQ owner (fact, as an AGENT of Her Majesty) and they cannot say otherwise anyways, it's now a proof of where Pierre Daoust stands vs them...\n\nWhat's the latest news regarding the electricity in PIERRE DAOUST's house ??",
