   "message": "\"convince men to enlist to fight against slavery.\" David-Paul Sip, that was from the library in your ass!! (Twice today that I got to say that!!!). Not true. Lincoln PROCLAIMED slavery was abolished because he thought the freed slaves would fight their 'oppressors' with the Northern aggression. The VALUABLE CONSIDERATION offered was 3/5th of a person.  Funny thing though....by what authority did he do that?  Think about it....the Southern states seceded and printed their own script. The only reason the Emancipation Proclamation had any weight ever is due to BELIEF.\n\nBut he created a bunch of stateless persons...therefore, they had to ACCOUNT for them, hence the 14th Amendment. \n\nEnough history...let's get back to overthrowing a banking system.",
