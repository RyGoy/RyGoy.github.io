   "message": "\"convince men to enlist to fight against slavery\"  was simply my \"Coles Notes\" version Chris, a summarization. Yes my words, possibly from my ass, lol since I do not recall where I read this but I did read that Lincoln was all to aware that men would not fight over what I recall being a trade dispute.
