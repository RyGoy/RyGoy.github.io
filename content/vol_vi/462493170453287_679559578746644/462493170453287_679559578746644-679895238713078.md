   "message": "LaNi Black.....\n\nBill of Exchange.\nHere�s HOW I do it, and WHY�..\n\nThe first step is definitely to open the mailbox, now, that mailbox is not even MY mailbox if I really THINK about it, it�s the person named PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX is mailbox, I just happen to be the SOLE authorized ADMINISTRATOR for this person right ?\n\nSo, as a good administrator, I have the key for this mailbox, and I go there EVERYDAY.\n\nAnyway, I open the mailbox, and HA HA�!!!!.....a bill of exchange is in it, a BILL if you wish�..fro\n\nNow, this Bill of Exchange (Bill) is addressed to the person I happen to be the SOLE authorized administrator of�.it is addressed to PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX, so, as the SOLE authorized administrator, I have to open that envelop and TAKE CARE of that matter.\n\nSo let say the City of Montreal sent to PIERRE DAOUST this bill of exchange, and it says on it $295.00, now, WHO owe $295 to the City of Montreal ?, yes, it�s PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX, not me�but the person I �HAVE�\n\nNow, what do I do with this, mmhhh, �..I see 2 choices.\n\n1). I can, yes �ME�, I can buy back this debt, and use some Bank Notes and go to the post office to buy a money-order and send it to the City of Montreal, and they will balance their book with this. I can NOT send the Bank Notes (cash) to them, they won�t ACCEPT it, I wonder WHY ? �.they won�t accept BANK NOTES as payment, because it�s ILLEGAL to pay a debt with a debt, they want ME to turn these BANK NOTES (Money of Exchange) into MONEY OF ACCOUNT.\n\n2). I can ADMINISTRATE this debt for PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX, because the truth is that this bill of exchange has been commenced by the City of Montreal for PIERRE DAOUST, because they ASSUME that PIERRE DAOUST is too ignorant to do it, so they commenced it��they are the BENEFICIARY party to this bill of exchange, and PIERRE DAOUST is the DRAWER party to this bill of exchange.\n\nNow, we are missing one party, because a bill of exchange has 3 parties, the BENEFICIARY, the DRAWER and the DRAWEE.\n\nWHO is the drawee for this bill of exchange ?.....I need to find where is the SURETY of this PERSON named PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX, and when I�ll find that, I will be able to KNOW who is the drawee.\n\nDrawee: The party on which an order for the payment of money is drawn.\nDrawer: One that draws, especially one that draws an order for the payment of money.\n\nI will NOT explaine this one in details, but I have very good reasons to believe that the drawee has to be The Bank of Canada, because the SURETY for PIERRE DAOUST is definitely the Government, since they have created PIERRE DAOUST, and on the CERTIFICATE that prove its creation, the signature is the government signature, so therefor, the SURETY, and since the Bank of Canada is the government�s bank, I am sure that the ORIGINAL certificate of PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX, is sitting in their building. So the DRAWEE is the Bank of Canada.\n\nSo, as one of the BEST sole authorized administrator in town, Here is HOW I do it.\n\nI turn this Bill of Exchange on the Private side (Back), and I take out my STAMPS \n\nThe first stamp says:\n\nACCEPTED BY:______________ (I sign there)\n\nThe 2nd stamps say: DATE\n\nThe third says: ACCOUNT NO. 26X-XXX-XXX or 119XXXXXXXXXXX\n\nAnd the fourth says: Bill of Exchange ACT (1985)\nOn the front of the bill, I stamp in red: �See back for Endorsement�, so the beneficiary of this debt will know he/she have to flip it over, if I don�t put that rubber stamp, they might not turn it and that could create confusion :D\n\nAlso, on the front I stamp in black: �Bank of Canada�, because, as per the BoE Act, the three parties needs to be clearly identified on the front of the instrument.\n\nI have good reasons to believe that this COMPLETE that bill of exchange, turn it into a �check� and discharge the debt.\n\nI include a small one page letter with it giving EXPLAINATION on what I�m doing.\n\nI send the Bill of exchange COMPLETE to the Beneficiary registered mail, in this case, City of Montreal, and as per the Bill of Exchange act, they have the OBLIGATION to present that thing to the Bank of Canada, if they don�t, it relief the DRAWER and the DRAWEE from that debt.(art.84 of the bill of exchange act)",
