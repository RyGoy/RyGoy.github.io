   "message": "COMMERCIAL INVOICE: \nDocument used in *foreign* trade to determine true value of the *imported* GOODS\n\nUnlike the juridical PERSON, Beverly is foreign to the Trustee Corporation and it's agents.\n\nAlso, a judge can't utilize UCC regulation on the Trustee Corps behalf, until jurisdiction is established over some manner of \"GOODS\": all tangible, movable items.  (If there are no goods on the table, then the issue is subject to common law, not UCC)\n\nNOT considered \"goods\":\n-Rea Estate\n-Valuable Paper (stocks, bonds, securities)\n-Services\n-Rights\n\nBILL OF LADING:\nA document signed by a carrier (a TRANSPORTER of goods). Carriers using ALL modes of *transpiration* issue bills of lading when they undertake the transportation of *cargo*\n\nCARGO:\nIn mercantile law. The load or lading of a *vessel*; goods, merchandise or whatever is CONVEYED in a ship or other merchant VESSEL (persons may also be considered vessels)\n\nCONVEY:\nTo pass or transmit the title to property from one to another; to transfer property or the title to property by deed or instrument under seal. To convey real estate is, by an appropriate instrument, to transfer the legal title to it from the present owner to another.\n\nThe juridical PERSON is the MERCANTILE VESSEL used to CONVEY cargo.  Beverly's blood sweat and tears are the presumed cargo.\n\nMERCANTILE AGENT:\nAgent who a PRINCIPAL authorizes to purchase and liquidate assets, and to raise funds by using the principalï¿½s assets as loan collateral.\n\nPRINCIPAL:\nFull meaning of a word should be ascertained at the outset, in order that the sense may not be lost by defect of expression, and that the law be not without reasons.\n\nThe party with authority in a business relationship. Or a business transactions face value. Refer to agent and notional.\n\nThe juridical PERSON is NOT the principal, it's just an instrument of CONVEYANCE, a transporting VESSEL.  Beverly is the principal and whatever goods and non-goods she can claim as exclusive to herself, are her assets / property.\n\nBILL: (Formal declaration), noun allegation of facts, claim.\n\nPrincipal is ACCOUNTED for by CLAIM of FACT.\n\nSo, when you FAIL to distinguish and DEFINE the principal, then you have no claim in fact, and your assets are considered abondoned.  Why?  Because you are the principal, but non compos mentis, mutes, corpses and legal fictions are ALL incapable of claiming the property of man, as only man can make and VERIFY a CLAIM / BILL to property, but ONLY if that claim is advanced before a court of record.  It won't go anywhere before an administrative venue / court because administrative venues only hear legal fictions.\n\nAgain, non compos mentis, mutes, corpses and legal fictions are ALL incapable of claiming the property of Beverly, which is WHY the Trustee Corp must convince her as the PRINCIPAL to interface via Trusttee agents and the juridical PERSON belonging to the Trustee Corp, ALL in hopes that the principal agrees or defaults into pledging property to a government official / MERCANTILE AGENT to administrate as a SURETY / BOND / SECURITY on the Corp's behalf, not on your behalf.....at that point, you're \"dead\" as far as they're concerned, your estate is up for grabs.\n\nFURTHERMORE, if the you go in as the principal trying to administrate the Trustee Corp's PERSON instead of the Principal's OWN property, then don't be surprised when a judge decides that you're making false claims to trustee property by committing perjury through IMPERSONATING a public entity with authority to administrate juridical PERSONS.\n\nAs the principal you can only control your own property.\n\nBut look on the bright side, if the judge decides you mistakenly committed fraud, then you're just another NON COMPIS MENTUS, and thus can't make claim as principal to any of your own assets / property.....thus, that property is considered abandoned cargo for the Judge to administrate on bahlf of the \"Trustee\" Corporation.....but are they really your trustee?  Nope....they're the juridical person's trustee.  You ain't a beneficiary, you just got tricked into pledging your assets to their beneficiary.",
