   "message": "<<How can we move forward in anything when we spend so much time hurting one another, and arguing amongst ourselves?>> My comments: 1) Love, absolutely love your writing style Tara Duncan 2) Love this group for \"keeping shit REAL\". No filters. No sense of entitlement. Just calling things as they are. 3) When folks see that we are ALL the same racism cannot exist. We bleed the same, breathe the same, and shit the same way. Unfortunately folks are too busy using their eyes to see shit that is superficial at best. I don't care what \"colour\" you are or who you prefer to fuck. None of my business. 4) I am very annoyed by this selfish act of \"self-censoring\". Pissed that it was by \"one of our own\". I did enjoy Lammi's contributions and am vexxed that she BELIEVED that she was ENTITLED to deprive me of the value contained in the thread she deleted. BITCH! Have fun out there with the fucking sheeple. When the shit hits the fucking fan they will be there to take care of you I'm sure.",
