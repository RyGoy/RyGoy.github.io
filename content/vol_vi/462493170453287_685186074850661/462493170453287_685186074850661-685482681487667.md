I am sad that I missed all the fun.\nI shall try to be as objective as possible whenever you (or anyone else) show me a possible flaw in my thinking. I can't say that social programming has been completely eradicated from my interactions, however, I think it is a mission I shall never abandon as long as I don't \"lose\" my mind. \nI think this place of truth is quite \"fair\" in that ALL beliefs are held with the same amount of disrespect well deserved.",
