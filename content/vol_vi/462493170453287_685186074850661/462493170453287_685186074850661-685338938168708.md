   "message": "I could have become concerned about the direction this group is heading...bear with me while I explain: \n\n2 of the groups' collective offspring (aka threads with value) have now been sacrificed, along with 2 animals, namely a puppy and a lamb(i)...\n\nIf I didn't know better, I may have previously likened it to a cult, akin to the old testament...except for some key facts:\n\nEverything I have witnessed here is verifiable.\n\nNo one has asked me to believe anything\n\nNo one forced me to be here\n\nNo one has tried to sell me anything (Kent Kent Barrett's mugs don't count ;-) )\n\nWe can, individually and collectively take the piss out of our respective failings (thinking wrong and valuing the wrong things) in a true effort to deprogram the bullshit we have been fed\n\nYou folks are honest; when bullshit is called it is for educational, not malicious purposes...it is not sugar coated, but the lesson is invariably wrapped in intelligent humour\n\nThere is a genuine effort, purpose and and plan to right wrongs\n\nI am becoming much better at critically assessing information which has simplified my life immensely\n\nSo, all flippancy aside, we may be fulfilling an agenda, but the wisdom/information and potential value contained here is immeasurable ('potential' because I still think wrong and do not yet fathom the full extent of what I am learning here), so Thank you all...no group hug necessary \n\nBut please, can y'all try not to sacrifice anymore animals, especially bunnies, kitties or carp? :D",
