   "message": "Tara Duncan, I am very thankful you wrote this article. I am the first to make a joke out of something or laugh when I read something of humour, but I see the importance your of message. And, as ALWAYS, you are more than \"on the spot.\"\n\nAs some of you know, I had previous interactions with LaNi Black (make note that she called herself BLACK, in reference to her skin colour, let that sink in), and I had tried using humour to point her at her prejudice against non-blacks. Lammi ain't got no time fo dat!  \n\nEverything is backwards. One can be presented as the oppressed minority looking for redemption for the wrongs of an evil world, but in reality one can be the oppressor, the oppressed, and a spreader of evil and division among the world.\n\nHer prejudice is so strong, that she even felt entitled to steal the free conversation we had! :O That is so fucked-up,  in so many ways. I cannot imagine having such characters in a position of power. Very dangerous.\n\nThe act of  self-censoring. <<Who needs opponents when we self-censor?  Perhaps you can think about this for just a moment.>>  This is why, I guess, some things will continue to be as constant as the Northern Star. Some folks just are way to comfortable with slavery. \n\nThank you, Tara!",
