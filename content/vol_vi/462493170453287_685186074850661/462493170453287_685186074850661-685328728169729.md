   "message": "A few thoughts on the concept of \"Lammi\".   Lammi was not just a member of the group, but a frequent caller to our household.  She consumed vast amounts of Scott's time during their conversations and he missed meals and stayed up late to accommodate her on a number of occasions.  On one such evening I asked who was on the phone.  The answer I heard was \"Lammi\".  \n\nI really did rescue a little lost stuffed animal from a mud puddle in a parking lot (actual story deleted - see above) who's name, according to the tag, was \"Lammi\".  I had a soft spot in my heart for that little lamb, and the name \"lammi\" is adorable.  Just say it out loud.  So Lani/Lammi was born -  reinforced by the fact that everyone yelled, \"Lammi\" whenever she phoned.  Lammi knew the story behind the nickname, and she knew, or should have known no insult was intended. So sure, maybe the whole racism/censorship thing makes me spitting mad...but she went too far when she tried to make something evil or duplicitious out of the parking lot story.  She crapped on the cuteness that is \"Lammi\".  Nobody fucks with the lamb!",
