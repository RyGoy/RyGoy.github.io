   "message": "Hey guys!  I could use some advice...\n\nWhat should I do if the utility company is ignoring the completed BOE?\nI have administrated the public debt(hydro) on two properties I have and gave 30days for rebuttal.  They responded with a threat to cut service, so I send an email that stated that the debt had been administered lawfully and DO NOT cut service because children would be put in danger without the public utility. \nThey respond with registered mail stating that the PERSON who holds the account is responsible to pay or they will send to collections.  \nI send an email thanking them for the correspondence, and tell them that I am not the PERSON, I am the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for that name and I have sent them the completed BOE with instructions to discharge the debt.  The manager of the office sends me a personal email to threaten collections if they don't receive payment, and that they will not respond to the matter anymore.  \nI return her email stating I have completed the BOE, returned it in due course, and they are now the holder and they can do whatever they please, but I suggest to present it Bank of Canada for discharge. \nSo, they cut the service at my tenant's house and I am forced to pay to regain power.  \nI have emailed the manager to state that there is an obvious dispute over payment and I would like some remedy for being enslaved to their debt.  \nI am being ignored...\n\nFucking cocksuckers knew that they would put me in a awkward position by cutting the power at the tenants house.  The debt was $700 at my place and only $300 where they cut the power.\n\nI am going to continue to complete any BOE that they send me.  This time I'll send a notarized copy of the BC and a NOM.    \n How do I respond if they cut the power?  How do I respond that they did cut the power?\n\nThanks guys.  :)",
