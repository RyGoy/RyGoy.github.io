   "message": "Hello all.\n\nI'm new to the group this week. I've spent quite a while already reading old posts and the documents posted.\n\nI have a couple of questions.\n\nThe first I'm sure is an easy one. Could someone bump the thread about the dogecoin stuff that had 1300+ comments? It was referred to in another thread I was reading but I can not find it with this mobile app... Perhaps I can when I get home.\n\nMy second question is in regard to something Scott Duncan has said in multiple threads about how we are thinking wrong, and putting value on the wrong things. I have for a long time (back into my teens) always held the position that the only thing I really have that is of any value is my time. I remember discussing this with my wife (girlfriend at the time) when she had brought home a case of beer for me and then carelessly dropped it in the driveway and smashed half of it. She thought I was mad about having the beer, and I was trying to explain that the beer is only beer, bought with money that is only money. Both of which I can easily replace, but the time is gone forever.\nMy question is.. Am I on the right track with that line of thinking or should I be digging into that a little more?\nHave you guys already covered this in another thread that I haven't gotten to yet?\n\nThanks for your time, thanks for keeping all the posts up (even the ones you refer to as shit stains have something there to ponder)",
