   "message": "UPDATE: Looks like someone is not impressed with me. Apparently I'm a \"fucktard\" and we here at TTFL, collectively are all \"dickheads\".\n\nAnd I quote - \n\"Gee whizz....you really are a brain dead zombie spineless piece o crap too....carry on fucktard & I'll laugh hard as y'all fall in the trap. ...carry on dipshit......RahahahahahahahahHahhahahahah. ....you need the tender play skewl group as it's especially designed for dickheads\"like you\"\n\nAdam, I'm not here to make friends. And should I develop friendships as a result of being a member of this group, it would certainly not be with opinionated, know-it-all pricks like you.\nRemember this - Its one thing if someone calls you a fucking tool, that's just one opinion, but if EVERYONE calls you a fucking tool, you might wanna take a close look in a mirror. YOU just might BE that fucking tool.\n\nFood for thought.",
