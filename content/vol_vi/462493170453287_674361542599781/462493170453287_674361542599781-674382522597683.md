   "message": "\"...but Scott, don't know the buck - o - five\". - Why the actual fuck, do ANY of you (Including this autistic drunk) have the hubris to declare that I don't understand something REGARDING COMMERCE OR LAW?\n\nThere's a reason I don't teach it. It's passing the balance to EVERYONE ELSE IN THE JURISDICTION.\n\nIt's an unethical act of hypocrisy. If I thought living off the value of the ignorant was OK, I'd just keep/leverage my title, not \"Fucked-o-five\" bullshit.\n\nAnd Adam, you didn't teach anybody ANYTHING because you write like a fucking retard. There's a reason you never go to retarded people for advice. See if you can figure out why that is, and you'll see why HERE IN REALITY you only left shit stains here.",
