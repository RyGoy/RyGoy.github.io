   "message": "Scott, do you really think that everyone who has a religious background is \"in on it\"? My whole family is VERY religious just by how they've been brought up. I really have never seen any of them take advantage of anyone, none of them live any better than I, meaning paying their mortgages, bills, etc. and \"being grateful\" for being able to live in such a beautiful country, etc. I see the illusion there (finally, actually)... but on the same token, maybe they need to see it somewhere as well?",
