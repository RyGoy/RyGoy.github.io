   "message": "\"Summary offences...\n\nIn the case of a summary offence (an offence tried in the District Court before a judge without a jury) the Gardaï¿½ (Irish Cops) must make a complaint to the District Court within six months of the offence being committed. These offences include most Road Traffic Offences like speeding, illegal parking and fixed charge notice offences...\"\n\nSaturday the 5th of April will mark 6 months and 1 day since my arrest for driving with no tax, insurance, cert of road worthiness, not producing a license, not giving a name or address, not signing anything (the list could prob go on)...\n\nIt's my understanding that no civil charges can be brought against a person after the 6 month mark. \n\nSo I think next week I will hold the arresting Guard accountable for my time on the night... :D\n\nI may be mistaken but I don't think we've had an instance of anyone try this out yet? Could make for a great thread! :D",
