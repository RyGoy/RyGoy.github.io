   "message": "That \"return to sender, no contract\" thing, seems to apply to debt collection agencies.\n\nIf I would have done this with Hydro-Quebec, they would have cut the service a long time ago, I am entering in the 23rd month of not acting as surety for that bill, and they have sent several NOTICE about the matter.\n\nI always ADMINISTRATE these notice, and always gave them the opportunity to say I WAS WRONG.....\n\nThe last communication (in writing) I had with them, I beg them to tell me I am wrong, literally begging them..... \n\nThey don't even give/sell the account to collection, even though it's close to $7000.00, according to them.\n\nNow, the ONLY logical step they have left, is to CUT THE SERVICE....\n\nBut I covered that angle with them, they know it would be illegal to do so.....\n\nWill they commit an ILLEGAL act ? .....we'll see !!! :D\n\nI have the RIGHT to PIERRE DAOUST's surety, and NO ONE can stripped me from that right, if it's NOT true, I need to know, and I will know.... :P\n\nI know others who tried what I do, but didn't took the time to learn WORDS, and their meanings, a guy called me 2 days ago to tell me the service has been cut, after only four months, I asked the guy WHAT were you trying to do and WHY ?\n\nHe couldn't answer me, he couldn't even explain what he was doing and WHY....his communication was filled with stupidities, he was NOT using the right words, even thought I tried to helped him using these words and WHY using them....\n\nThere is no MAGIC in all this, there is only LEGAL EASE, and if I am not ready to THINK, and to LEARN, this will end up in a CUL-DE-SAC. :D\n\nI need to know WHAT I am doing,WHY I am doing it, ALL the \"tools\" available to me, and the right ADMINISTRATION materials to do that DUTY. :)\n\nThis shit ain't a joke ! :D\n\nIt's not I want, or I demand, or I request, or I would like, or I need, or I think......it's \"I WISH\", yes, I \"WISH\".....je SOUHAITE tabarnak :D",
