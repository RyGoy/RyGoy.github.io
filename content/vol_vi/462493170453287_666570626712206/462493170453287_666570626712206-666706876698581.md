   "message": "Why would one need the \"other\" party's agreement? Now that we are thinking surety was accepted upon the purchase of property, I am not so sure \"rescinding\" is a good choice. This subject has been a struggle for us (as much as the marriage subject). And we have made some mistakes. We were thinking that by signing as the \"homeowner\", we were accepting surety. I am sure that is probably true also, but we were not thinking at all about the actual purchase of the property as being where surety was accepted. We have bought the debt now btw.",
