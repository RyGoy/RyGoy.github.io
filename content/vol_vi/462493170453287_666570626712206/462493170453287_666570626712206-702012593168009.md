   "message": "Ok Pete Daoust, since I am still working on \"catching up\" with old threads as well as trying to keep up with current ones.... I have come back to this one with a question.\n\nIn my mortgage, I signed a page that states an oath that \" The deponent(s) is/are 19 years of age or older and is/are resident(s) in Canada under the Income Tax Act (Canada).\"\n\nWhen I go through the Income Tax Act online, and I try to find a definition for \"resident\" I cannot find one. I also can't find a definition for Canada.\n\nIn the Interpretations Act, Canada is:\n\n� Canada �\n\n�Canada�, for greater certainty, includes the internal waters of Canada and the territorial sea of Canada;\n\nMaxim on includes - is the exclusion of all else right?\n\nDoes this mean that Canada is only water and that I have sworn an oath that I am a \"resident\" of water?",
