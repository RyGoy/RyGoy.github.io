   "message": "So anyway I think what they think justifies my arrest is the refused on the signature line. They take you to jail here if you won't promise to appear. They take you in front of the judge right then, but I never saw a judge. They held me for ransom until my wife paid their ransom. I wasn't a creditor and didn't know any of this shit then so I signed everything under duress so they would let me out of jail. They stole my truck to. It was on private property and they impounded it. So I'm treating this ticket separately from the arrest. How I handle this arrest is still on the table but I need to handle this ticket so my person doesn't lose its permission to drive. It has a cdl and a job and the like.",
