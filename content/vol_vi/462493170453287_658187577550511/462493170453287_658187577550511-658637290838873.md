   "message": "Being a creditor in commerce requires discipline, a TON OF IT. You need to know this shit inside and out, enough to know - ONLY ASK QUESTIONS and NEVER ANSWER A QUESTION from ANYONE in the public jurisdiction.\nWhy is it that \"gurus\" such as Gordon Hall, Tim Turner and Dean Clifford all ended up in jail? They failed the test at SOME level and became the trustees; SURETY was pinned to them by way of something they said or an action they did - PLAIN AND SIMPLE. Let's remember these guys are attempting to AWAKEN the public and have HUGE targets on their backs; THERE IS NO room for error if you decide to wear those shoes.\nYou can AFV or administrate ANY process but if you ACT like a debtor, you HAVE NO CHANCE in ANY success.\nThe public has attacked Brandon Adams many times, unsuccessfully, he's as solid as they get; that's why he's NOT in jail and STILL continues to teach - same goes for Winston Shrout. These 2 guys are the ONLY \"teachers\" I've come across who have stood the \"test\", besides maybe Scott, who appears to keep a low profile in terms of \"teaching\". I don't call what Menard does \"teaching\".\nSuccess in ANY administrative process is not in the paperwork, it is in the intent, conviction, understanding and comunication, that's why the NOM is FUCKING USELESS unless you truly understand it and what it does in regards to the legal trust.\nDo you think Scott Duncan or Brandon Adams need the NOM filed to get the point accross in some fucking court case they might happen to be dragged into? I don't fucking think so!\n\nPeace",
