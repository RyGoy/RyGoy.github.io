   "message": "OK I've been listening to the cic guys and they talk about going to court as the accommodation party for the defendant to settle the debt and balance the account. They talk about being authorized to enter a GUILTY plea and STAND UNDER the charges if they can inspect the original charging instrument. Then they a4v it. If they don't accept that payment they conditionally accept the fact that there may be a defect in the instrument if they are allowed an opportunity to correct the defect....so on and so forth\n\nI was told by some smart dudes in this group to never accept surety or a charge. Always refuse for cause or void the instrument. Which way is better and why? Or are these just two different ways to skin this cat?",
