   "message": "And Bork is all about his \"book\", selling it etc.  -  I had the resources to give away free copies of his book, so after he blocked and removed me, I assumed he didn't want my \"business\" anymore.  So, ironically, his actions cost him.  I don't expend any energy figuring out \"people\" and their subjective agendas.  If I see quality information (not misinformation), that's all I am interested in.  If the \"person\" exhibits \"odd\" behavior or habits of some sort, I really can care less... whatever floats your boat.  All I want is the truth.  If I develop meaning relationships (in private) with others, awesome; bonus.",
