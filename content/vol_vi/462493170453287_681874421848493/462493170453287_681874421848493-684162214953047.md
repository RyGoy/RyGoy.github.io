   "message": "Thanks Mackximus Minimus, this has helped me get back to the older posts.\nI'd also like to thank everyone else in the group here that post regularly and dissect/analyze everything through the comments. I often find myself at the beginning of a thread with a bunch of questions that seem to get answered throughout the thread. And, that is also why I don't post much here, because I am sure that most of my questions are already answered. I just have to find the posts and read them :)\n\nDid you guys know that the search feature sucks ass? Just sayin' ...\n\nI just need to find more hours in the day to read! haha\nBut thanks again to you all.",
