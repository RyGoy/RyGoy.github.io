   "message": "OK, here I share something that took me MANY, MANY, MANY freaking hours to put together. I did it for ME, to be able to study, and have a record of my activities at The Tender for Law. \n\nIt's ALL the surviving posts made to the group, and the comments, from January of 2013, to June 13th, 2014, 10:00am, to be precise. It's called \"The Tender For Law Anthology\" with 9 pdf volumes filed with all the gold nuggets, and wisdom from Admiral Scott. It's even organized by dates. \n\nHere is a link to the box.com share file. It's 9 files, all together no more than 2G, so prepare that external hard-drive, Dropbox, or better have some space in your machine.\n\nThis is free! (Duh!) For whoever wants to start thanking me, please thank Scott Duncan, the only, and real source of knowledge, and truth here. So save your thank you's for Admiral Scott, and if you really mean it, pay with your cunt (I'm flexible with the needy), or donate to any of the following addresses: \n\nDogecoin: DT1a6omL6cJXA6dhntEGGesuwDbemmvxnv\nBitcoin: 14mceAzpZqCVkpsRLoeFMKQdqG28EoUReY\n\nHope this helps everyone that wants to study, and for the newbies to be able to see the evolution of this group!",
