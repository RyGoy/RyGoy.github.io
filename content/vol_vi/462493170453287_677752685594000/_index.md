   "message": "As many of you are aware the  gas was cut off this week. Cold showers are not cool lol The trustee corp agent was forced to buy back the debt in order to have peace in my home and enjoy a hot shower. \n\nAs mentioned in Pete Daoust \"Invoice\" thread, about receipts and the Bank of Canada. a credit card was used to buy back the debt (turns out enbridge doesn't accept visa lol) and they don't give receipts, they say it will show up on your next \"invoice\" (her words) even though the piece of paper I got clearly states it is a bill. \n\nThe debt was bought back via a commercial bank and the bank teller stamped a receipt created by 8750432 CANADA INC in the amount of what was \"paid\". The trustee corporation then took that receipt, wrote 'consumer purchase' on it, had me sign the back with my SIN and date. Public notice was also sent and a second notice directing the bank of canada to remit (as per the Bills of Exchange act section V) to 8750432 CANADA INC  the sum of $XXX. I also identified who was the drawee, drawer and beneficiary.\n\nNot sure that is the proper procedure, but I guess we'll see",
