   "message": "I am still laughing at the \"I'm all set\" bullshit!  Hahahahaha! They are ALL lairs. \n\nBut at the same time, reality is that these profile of nut job are dangerous, because they don't keep their delusions to themselves. But rather go prey on idiots, and SELL delusion as knowledge. How many people had ended-up in a mess, and became VICTIMS of these delusions? \n\nLet's not look that far. Let's think Dean Clifford. On November's infamous Hamilton seminar, Dean said to attendants (myself included) \"the trust\" created by the government was already \"set-up\" for us to use, so go and use it :O ; that the use of cash did not attach ANY jurisdiction, codes, or statutes :O ; that submitting pleading to court does not create joinder :O, I can tell you a few more.\n\nMany of us know Dean as someone who would not hurt anyone intentionally, but think: how many people have already hurt themselves or someone else, and how many more WILL hurt themselves following the non-sense above? To prove my point, Dean is in jail, unfortunately.\n\nSo, Allen Nelson Boisjoli, aka Sovereign UnderGod'sPants, KNOWS he is a FRAUD. He knows it. That is why he has that nonsensical \"disclaimer\" in his videos. \n\nAt least he is... ALL-SET, and FIXED-UP! Hahaha!",
