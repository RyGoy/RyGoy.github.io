I'm not kidding here, this DID happen. They have a rental car and end up in Winnipeg to crown Patrick as WFS mascot or something to the effect. They depart Winnipeg and are on the way to Ontario for a freedumb bash. Along the way, Menard takes off his shoes and the fight starts. They end up in some hotel in some small place and the next morning when Menard wakes up, he finds Allan and the car gone, on the way back to Edmonton. Menard is stranded, but FREE!",
