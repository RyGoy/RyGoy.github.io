   "message": "By making \"EVERYTHING\" a commercial act, it consumed everything. Even our own \"reproduction\", which I find spectacularly disgusting [Christians / Vatican]. The system is taxing you just to exist. Worse, it is selling you your own freedom, which is the \"legalization\" of voluntary slavery, involuntarily. These groups wordsmithed the legislative agenda for the past 70 years.  A FRN is the legalized tender of fraud for the oligopoly of \"Private banks\".",
