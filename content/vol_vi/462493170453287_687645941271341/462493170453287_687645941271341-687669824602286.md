   "message": "Vicky Logozar has hit on the threat Menard poses. His lies of ommission.\n\nHe banks on the ignorance of others. Vicky simply examined what he says and compared it with what she KNOWS, (not BELIEVES) and the lie was obvious.\n\nA Piece-of-shit Christian won't do that and will \"go with god\".\n\nWant to spot evil, look for those Citing \"God\" AND Preaching \"peace\"; They are all vile scum who mean you harm. JUST LOOK FOR VICTIMS.\n\n... I have none. I take from NOBODY. I GIVE to forward my agenda. That agenda leads to something Morally indefensible, but ABSOLUTELY necessary. I've never hidden that either.\n\nNONE of you are qualified or ready for the fight that's coming. I aim to change that. I simply think on a larger scale than the rest of you. Call that \"ego\" instead of accepting it as fact, at your own peril. :D",
