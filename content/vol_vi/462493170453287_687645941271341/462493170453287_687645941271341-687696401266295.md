   "message": "This note IS legal tender. That that IS is not that that IS not (read until you get it) so Menard doesn't realize that he is spouting nonsense because  facing up to this fact would undermine his entire freedumb philosophy. Conversely when the dollar originally had written on it for 'payment of ALL debts, public and private' it was giving notice that it wasn't really money even though the majority would never quite grasp this. In law the inclusion of one thing is the exclusion of all others. A private debt as we know can be settled by any method such as with favours or even with a bullet in the head. Or you could promise to pay by writing an IOU or hand over a piece of paper called a bank note which is really a promise to pay a promise. Here in Australia the banknotes don't even have a dollar symbol on them and the numbers are irregular making the numbers appear as such 1o, 2o, 5o and so on. Really they are just pretty pieces of plastic that people BELIEVE is money.",
