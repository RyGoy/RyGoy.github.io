   "message": "'Money is debt in transit'...makes so much sense:\n\nThe day to day cash/debt transfer situation may or may not have the legal obligations enforced...does that mean that the obligation doesn't exist?\n\nIn much the same way as running a red light at 2am may not have the 'illegal' act enforced...does that mean that a statutory (clubhouse) offence has not occurred?\n\nBUT, when a cop is at the side of the road or a red light camera takes a pic, it is quite probable that there will be some form of enforcement of the statutory obligation/penalty.\n\nSIMILARLY, when someone places that legal tender into an account, the bank is well within its rights to give the account a 'haircut/bailout/steal from it' because they are taking back what is theirs...Cyprus being a case in point.\n\nAGAIN, when a government entity is allowing and/or supporting 'quantitative easing'/dumping billions into the money supply, there is a collective 'theft' or 'dilution' of the perceived wealth of the masses...or are they just serving their own corporate agenda using their own corporate tools?\n\nOR every time someone signs or inputs a pin for a credit card transaction, creating an increase in the level of M3 for the equivalent amount as the transaction, this dilution of the collective value of the legal tender acts as a stealth tax/act of theft against the value of every holder and/or user of legal tender.\n\nSo, IF the creator of that legal tender has the AUTHORITY to manipulate the (perceived) VALUE of their creation in this manner, there is obviously a knock on effect to EVERY holder and/or user of that legal tender...no one who uses that shit gets to escape the tender for law, it is all pervasive.\n\nBy using legal tender or 'a' legal tender, everyone is subject (to a greater or lesser degree) to the rules governing its' creation and/or destruction.\n\nBy actively shrinking money supply (ie: taking back what is theirs on a massive scale), the situation becomes akin to the classic childrens' game musical chairs...except there are loads of children and not many chairs...\n\nWhether the perceived VALUE of the 'a' legal tender goes up or goes down, many (and progressively more) people are going to be exchanging their energy, time and property for a progressively smaller/less valuable piece of pie...the knock on effect to society will be massive and unprecedented...\n\nTo say that these events do not adversely affect EVERY user of 'a' legal tender is naive at best, because although every transaction has not been accounted for, everyone holding and/or using 'a' legal tender shall be held accountable and one way or another, the debt is going to be enforced.",
