   "message": "An Economic census that markers use is not BS.  It is the measure of economic activity and productivity.  If you manufacture window treatments, what is the market value for window treatments? What is the size or opportunity of the window treatment market in China? Because China must use the same building codes as the US. The building codes in China are dramatically different. So, your product does not physically meet the demands in China. So the shipment of 2 million dollars in product sent to China is now worthless.  All because you did not investigate the market. I don't lie. I backup my work with validated statistics.",
