   "message": "Just to recap, lawyers are absolute cunts. The definition of lying by omission. And the worst part is not that they don't know, its that they do. \n\nI was appointed executor of my mothers will and was told (pre tender for law) that if I wanted to execute my mothers will I would have to buy a 2.500ï¿½ debt from the solicitor for him to carry out the probate process, which I did myself. I didn't see why (due to my fuck you nature) to which he replied, that's just how it works...\n\nCunts. \n\nApologies for my language... *awaiting instructions to bring it down and have the opportunity to tell my friends, TOLD YOU SO. :-P",
