   "message": "This is correct Pete... the collection agency does not have a contract with you Eamonn just because they bought your debt. They understand the risks and that you may not want to buy it from them. The answer is YES or NO...I say NO :) You could also negotiate a generous discount since they bought the debt at a very steep discount themselves. Remember the collection agency is  motivated to sell to recover their investment at the very least lol!",
