   "message": "So here is the draft affidavit and invoice I've done as a result of my arrest 6 months ago... It's my first affidavit and invoice so I'd be grateful for any help... \n\nFor anyone un-informed members - I was arrested 6 months ago while driving home. Plenty of charges could have been brought but I refused to give a name or sign anything and was released without charge...\n\n6 months is the time limit for summary cases to be filed with the court here in Ireland. \n\nI am now issuing a bill for my time on the night...\n\nChris, Pete, Scott, Mackximus, Beverly, Ceit...\n\nSome uncertainties -\n\nI'm issuing the bill through the person as the administrator yes?\nShould the affidavit be signed and qualified?\nIs asking for a cheque the right thing to do? Or should I ask for 1 billion Dogecoin? :p\n\nCheers for any help guys...",
