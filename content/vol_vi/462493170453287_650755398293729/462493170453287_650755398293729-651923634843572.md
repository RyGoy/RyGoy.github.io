   "message": "I did this job years ago and the client didnt pay...so I took them to Kourt. The CONTRACT wasn't challenged, but the quality of work was. I had written some instruction on the Invoice (which weren't followed and proven by the pictures she submitted). The Kourt ruled in my favor based on the 'care instructions' from the Invoice. \n\nAnyhow....I think the unrebutted Affidavit serves as the CONTRACT (should that be challenged) and you could put further instruction on the Invoice if necessary.....",
