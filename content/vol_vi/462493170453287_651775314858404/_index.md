   "message": "Update:\nSo I get a letter from the Crown, indicating that they want to \"drop the charge\" against...I dont know WHO against (since the one and only time they ever tried to \"read the charge\" I INTERRUPTED them by repeatedly asking \"who is YOU?\", and of course I received no answer)... for \"Threatening Death to Government Officials\", since there is suddenly a \"lack of public interest\" for the Crown to continue its \"case\" against me.\n\nThe little dick Crown called me quite a few times and finally set a date with me to come back to court.\nI went yesterday. Before court started... I ran into two liars...sorry lawyers I used to use. As I finish talking to them. ..another guy in a suit in his mid 50's walks up and offers his hand to introduce himself... but I already know him\nO'Driscoll. \n\nWhat I didnt know....\nHes now the Head Crown Attorney for the Region. Hes...the big cheese (confirmed by my one ex lawyer...who came RUNNING up to me later to ask me if I knew who that was and asked  me about what the big cheese said to me)...\n\nHe satbdown in front of rhe court eoom...and talked to me for 45 minutes. He said the little dick Criwn brought my case to him. The case apparently died on ODriscolls desk.\n\nHe also told me he came ro court that day for the sole purpose of seeing me (he had ni ither business there and actuallybgot up and left the building after we spoke), gave me his personal line number...and invited me to dinner. \n\nWho would have known paying attention and doing my bestbto follow and execute all ive learned HERE...wiuld wind me up where I am now...charge dropped and a visit and dinner invitation from the head Crown...a dude Ive had epic court battles with.\n\nI...ah... was gonna say... I believe I owe this group a thanks...only problem is that...its not a belief...It's a FACT!!!!",
