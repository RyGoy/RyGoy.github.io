You are extremely incompetent, and still trying to figure out all this after 2 years.\n\n2). You ALREADY collected on these debts, before sending them to PIERRE DAOUST, without waiting on my decision on weither I want to buy back these debts or not.\n\n3). WHY NOT JUST PRESENT these completed Bill of Exchange to Bank of Canada ?\nCompleted Bill of Exchange is �MONEY�.\n�money�\n�money� includes negotiable instruments;\n�negotiable instrument�\n �negotiable instrument� includes any cheque, draft, traveller�s cheque, bill of exchange, postal note, money order, postal remittance and any other similar instrument;\n*Financial Administration Act\n   R.S.C., 1985, c.
