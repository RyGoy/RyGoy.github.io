   "message": "So a few weeks ago, the internet account for WB was victim of a fraud. almost 150gb of internet transfer per day for almost 2 weeks, so I picked up a unusually high debt in WB's mailbox... I called them and try to work something out, nothing possible on their end...\n\nSince this was the result of a fraud, I decided to administrate that private debt through the PERSON's SURETY... \n\nFirst I picked up a communication saying something along the lines of :\n\"Here are the accepted methods of payment\" (bank transfer was listed as one)...\nAnd \"BTW this is from the Bank Of Canada's website : we do not offer banking services blabla...\"\n\nI sent them a new communication, asking by what authority they could give advice in regards to Bank Of Canada's activities, and explaining every detail of the law and giving them ALL the information they needed to proceed, because clearly, by their first communication, they proved they were either incompetent, ignorant, or acted in bad faith...\n\nGot the bill for the next monthly period, paid the balance owed for the current period, but added something saying \"for the outstanding balance for the month where the fraud occurred, THIS LADY has received everything you guys need to proceed and get paid... So talk to her my time is valuable and it's not my job to help you guys do yours\"...\n\nGot a call this morning from the internet company :\nThey REFUSE to collect the SURETY and get paid the total amount they claimed was owed by the PERSON ; instead they decided to just clear the extra debt off from the PERSON's account !!???\nThey just spit on 4 times their normal internet connection fees !!???\n\nWould you fucking believe that ?",
