(1985) B-4\nI stamp this on the back of each BoE I administrate, for reference purpose.\n\nA DATE stamp (on the back)\na STAMP with the inscription number (on the back)\na STAMP with the SIN number (on the back)\n\na STAMP: ACCEPTED BY: (I sign just beside this one) on the back.\n\na RED stamp saying: SEE BACK FOR ENDORSEMENT\nI stamp this one on the front of the BoE, so they�ll know they have to turn it around.\n\nA black stamp saying: Bank of Canada, I put this one on the front of the BoE, just under this long series of numbers, because the three parties of a BoE need to be correctly identified on the front of it, I am pretty sure that ALL these numbers on those BoE identifies the Bank of Canada, but not at 100%.\n\nThese freaking BoE's look pretty neat when I am finished with them :D\n\n:D",
