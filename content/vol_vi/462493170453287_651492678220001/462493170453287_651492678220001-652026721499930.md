   "message": "(Kimberly Paxton) SHTFplan.com Editor�s Note: It is apparent that the Federal government was under the impression that they could simply move into the ranch land surrounding Bunkerville, NV and have their way with the property and livelihood of the Bundy family.\n\nWhat they didn�t count on was the outcry from Americans across the country. And now things may be headed to the next level. As Kim Paxton of The Daily Sheeple notes, citizen militias in several states have been called up. Many members of those organizations are taking up arms and are making their way to Nevada.\n\nAnd it�s not just the citizen militias that are preparing to take action. The governor of Nevada has officially condemned the federal government�s actions, though he has yet to take any steps afforded to him under State law. Sheriff Richard Mack of Gilbert, Arizona has weighed in and calls the actions �terrorism.�\n\nAt last count there were some 200 federal agents from various agencies on the ground in Nevada and it appears that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of armed militia members will soon arrive to confront them.\n\nThe Federal government will no doubt step up their efforts, as they are facing the possibility of a widespread rebellion resulting from their actions against a private citizen whose only �crime� was to graze his cattle on the land his family has used for this purpose for over a century. It would not be at all surprising to see the President of the United States call up National Guard troops and more militarized law enforcement officials for fear of having this spiral out of control. A declaration of martial law to go along with already established First Amendment Areas is not out of the question.\n\nWe may well be on the cusp of a serious stand-off involving thousands of people. Keep in mind that most of them will be armed.\n\nGiven the circumstances, things could turn very bloody very quickly.\n\n:D :D",
