   "message": "distraction: What's a CDO?\n\nCDO stands for collateralized debt obligation.\n\nTo understand what that means, start with something simple like a mortgage or an auto loan. The good news for a lender is that he earns a profit � the interest rate � on the money leant out. The bad news is that the borrower may default.\n\nSo now imagine you had ten roughly similar loans. A person who owned-one tenth of each of those loans would earn the same interest rate as someone who owned a single loan, but the odds of all ten loans defaulting simultaneously are low. A package that consisted of one-tenth of ten separate loans would be a very simple form of collateralized debt obligation.\n\nThe same principle can be applied, however, to create very complicated securities. Investment banks did a lot of this during the pre-crisis years, and belief that these securities were very safe fueled a lot of lending activity.\n\n http://www.vox.com/2014/4/11/5602188/the-secs-just-been-caught-colluding-with-the-banks-its-supposed-to",
