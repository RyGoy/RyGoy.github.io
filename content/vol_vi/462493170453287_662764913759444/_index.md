   "message": "There is a situation some may be aware of where by a bank has received a default judgement against the person I hold in my pocket. The bank is the plaintiff and it's the lawyer who is sending me notices about garnishing and now threats to take my house. He also has claimed a few things in the latest letter that are not true that, because of the success of this fraud to date, need to be rebutted by someone I trust. What I's like to prevent is any possibility of joinder with the lawyer, to date he has not provided proof of standing and is a 3rd party interloper. I'm thinking that all the trustee responses to his correspondence should be sent to the bank CFO and the court file. The idea being, the claims are rebutted, but not allowing him (the lawyer) to create any kind of joinder. Any comments, insights would be appreciated.",
