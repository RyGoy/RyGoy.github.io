   "message": "Alright, i think i just wasted 30 minutes of my life on some stamp shit video from a guy on a commonwealth \"ahkay\" \"rayite\" trip...\n\nI understand what a bill of exchange is... \nWhen WB sends an invoice for payment, the client has a debt to pay... Let's say Fucks the Puppy's Pete Daoust is the client, and he's broke, and he wants a BILL for discharge... Where are we at ?\n\nI have no intention on trying to cash in on a $200 000 000 + or whatever SURETY... But there seems to be a bunch of motherfuckers doing it, and I have reasons to believe the more there is in that SURETY account the less the CAD is worth so the more we pay for daily shit and the less people have to feed the Sole Authorised Administrator they ignore they are :(",
