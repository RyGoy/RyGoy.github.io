   "message": "Banks write off an the debt as a loss (LOST-GONE), so the books are balanced, the balanced debt is then sold for a profit for cents on the dollar. Ask what is the current value of the debt and how much did the debt collector pay for it. Then ask the question did they buy a debt they know wasn't being paid expecting payment and are they nuts?",
