   "message": "bill n. 1) what is commonly called a \"check\" which the signer requires the bank to pay a third party a sum of money. This is a holdover from the days when a person would draw up a \"bill of exchange.\" 2) a statement of what is owed. 3) any paper money. 4) a legislative proposal for enactment of a law. It is called a bill until it is passed and signed at which time it is a law (statute) and is no longer referred to as a bill. 5) an old-fashioned term for various filed documents in lawsuits or criminal prosecutions, which is falling into disuse.",
