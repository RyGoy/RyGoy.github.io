   "message": "ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE 04/10/2014\nSPRINGFIELD, IL 62726-0001\n\nDear sir or madam,\n\n I have completed your tax forms to the best of my ability for the PERSON/TAXPAYER ELIJAH WEAKLEY. Enclosed is an INVOICE for my time and efforts required to complete the necessary paperwork as being forced to perform unpaid work is SLAVERY/INDENTURED SERVITUDE and that is ILLEGAL. \n\n I regret to inform you that due to economic hardship we can no longer buy back PUBLIC DEBTS. I have accepted the INCHOATE INSTRUMENT referred to as a PAYMENT VOUCHER that has been provided by your agency and returned it for DISCHARGE of the DEBT via the SURETY of this PERSON/TAXPAYER.\n \n  I could not find proper instruction for executing the provided INSTRUMENT but have acted in GOOD FAITH and completed it to the best of my ability and in line with my knowledge of  NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS and the banking system. Should there be a defect in the INSTRUMENT please help me complete it properly or provide a BILL for the amount due containing a COUPON/VOUCHER or other INSTRUMENT by which remedy is achieved. If you would be so kind as to include instructions for executing the INSTRUMENT so the debt may be DISCHARGED via the SURETY of the PERSON/TAXPAYER in question that would be greatly appreciated. \n\n If I do not receive a response from you within 30 days I shall assume and it shall be that this matter is settled for ELIJAH WEAKLEY. \n\nWith love and regards,\n\nFor:\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\nSole Authorized Administrator",
