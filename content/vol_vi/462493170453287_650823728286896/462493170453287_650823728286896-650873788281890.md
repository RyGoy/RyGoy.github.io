   "message": "Their clubhouse rules are very specific about what to do and how to do it...\n\nCrosscheck your local clubhouse rules against this party piece from New Zealand Administrative zone...they are virtually identical, just with different section numbers.\n\nWrite an explanatory note referencing the relevant section to each step you take in accepting and administrating, send it back with the instrument, requiring them to inform you of any defects in the instrument if they do not wish to accept it:  That is YOU acting in good faith as the Sole Authorized Administrator  :D\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJBblYulqFc\n\nI have not seen lies and deception, just 'legalese' masquerading as English...it's all hidden in plain sight...I am now somewhat aware of my own ignorance and am taking steps to accept responsibility & change that.",
