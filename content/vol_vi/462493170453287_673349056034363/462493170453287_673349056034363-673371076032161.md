   "message": "The money in your pocket, YOUR TIME EARNED IT. \n\nThose CHARGES addressed to the PERSON, they pile up based on THEIR rules which apply to THEIR PERSONs... \nIf you accept to PAY for those CHARGES, you give them reasons to believe YOU ARE the PERSON... \nThat's what they want ! That's how they make profit ! That's how they keep abusing MEN and WOMEN for their OWN BENEFIT !\nWhy would you decide to buy one of those debts addressed to THE PERSON which is THEIRS when you can ADMINISTRATE it through the PERSON's SURETY which exists PRECISELY because they CANNOT create a PERSON and take zero liability for it...\nThey can trick you to believe you have to PAY for that PERSON, but you can chose to learn... \n\nTrust me, it's not easy having to make these fucktards understand reality, but IT'S YOUR DUTY to work on this !\n\nI have YET to get a confirmation that any of those debts I administrated was discharged via the PERSON's SURETY. But the second I get this confirmation, trust me, I'll be able to PROVE it and TEACH everyone interested HOW to do it and what kind of trouble they may encounter dealing with all those fucktards who think they can suck their value : their time, sweat and blood !",
