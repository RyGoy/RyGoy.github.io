   "message": "OK. Friend if mine who is chicken shit to step into what you know and what I'm learning asked me to come along when he went to pay a traffic violation ticket this morning. \n\nSo I went in and the conversation above is what took place. Clerk was to the point... No small talk and I simply kept it short and sweet telling her the bills of exchange would put the public debt in dishonor and therefore the debt would be discharged if she refused the $20 bill. I even said my friend can give you a loonie and the same would apply. That's when she said \" your right... $20 is fine \"",
