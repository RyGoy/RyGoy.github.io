Accepting discussion about anything else, is a FUCKING NEGOTIATION. All of you are not seeing the forest through the trees. This is why I say Dean Clifford's position is flawed. He believes the tree can be pruned to look pretty again, when in reality it needs it's roots burned out, and it's limbs chopped up for one of Sir-Mica's gassifiers! The fucking tree is dead!\n\nUNDERSTAND?\n\nThe tree is dead!",
