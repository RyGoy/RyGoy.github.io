   "message": "pierre, there is a right way and a wrong way to do everything. i did not mean the WRONG WAY.\n\nIMHO every child NEEDS a structured day with not more than 2 hours of its own choosing. if you have nothing else for them to do, then start them studying chemistry and/or physics, and/or reading books that will teach them things, like HOW THINGS WORK.\n\ngo out and get them a set of hand tools.\nby the time i was a teen, i could tell by sight what size/type a bolt, or nail was and knew the difference between an open/box wrench, wrachet and why you used what for which application. AND what Ft/Lb of torque meant.\n\nget them some old broken lawn mowers, and tell them to fix them.",
