   "description": "An inquisitive alien visits Earth to check on our progress as a species, and gets into a conversation with the first person he meets. The alien discovers that we live under the rule of a thing called \"government\", and wants to understand more about what \"government\" is, what it does, and why it exists. \n\nPersonally, I think this is the best explanation of Govt I've ever heard. Let us know if you agree.",
