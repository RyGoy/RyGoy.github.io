   "message": "CLAIMING ANYTHING FROM THE GOVERNMENT IS BAD!\n\nANYTHING!\n\nLook at me. I'm turning into Scott Duncan. :(  Why can't any of you remember the basics? If you need ANYTHING from the Government, then you are a worthless parasite, and have no business here. Every cent you \"claim\" was taken by force from others.\n\nMaybe you think that's OK. I don't. Neither does Scott.\n\nFocus on the basics. These things shouldn't even be questions. It's RIGHT and WRONG.",
