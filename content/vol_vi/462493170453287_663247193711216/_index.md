   "message": "Scott may remember about a year ago we touched on the subject of social welfare payments/unemployment benefits...\n\nHere in Ireland the application for such benefits requires one to provide details that qualifies the applicant as a habitual RESIDENT. \n\nOnce the application is approved the benefit, usually cash, can be collected each week by signing for it at a local post office.\n\nSo what is one doing when collecting said benefit? By signing each week is the man/woman conjuring money into existence, therefore \"extending the overdraft\" and increasing the debt which will be then passed onto employees' income tax levies?\n\nPeople who have jobs often joke to friends without that they are \"paying their dole/benefits\"... That's making alot more sense now...",
