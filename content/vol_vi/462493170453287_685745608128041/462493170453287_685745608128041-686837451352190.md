   "message": "While I can certainly understand the impulse, I'm often tempted to physically abuse machines that are running Microsoft operating systems, I learned my lesson back in '98. The fan on my old 286 would stick, among other issues, and make this horrific sound. I got in the habit of giving it a little...love tap... And then one day I turned it on and received a message warning me that my hard drive had sustained physical damage. Lesson learned? Only submit your computer to VERBAL abuse in times like these! :p",
