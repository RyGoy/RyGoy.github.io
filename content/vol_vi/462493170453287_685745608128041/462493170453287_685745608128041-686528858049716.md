   "message": "Constitutions, \"sovereign seals\", Independence Days etc have no standing or relevance in the COMMERCIAL LEGAL SYSTEM. You are wasting your time with all that nonsense.\n\nTo give a frame of reference for the non-Irish in the group...\n\nIrish \"Free-dumbers\" believe that a man named Billy McGuire is the president of the \"Sovereign Republic\" of Ireland, and that each year the ritual of turning a little harp ornament in a particular building renews everyone's sovereignty each year. They also believe if certain members of government aren't present then they have no license to operate in Ireland... Can you imagine walking into a courtroom claiming \"I'm sovereign because Billy turned the little harp up the road there...!\" :p\n\nDespite Gerry claiming this ritual happens each year without fail, the Lord Mayor of Dublin refused their use of The Mansion House (where they usually turn it) this year...\n\nThis isn't a personal attack on you Gerry, but if you're still following all that crap having been in this group for so long then you're no better off...",
