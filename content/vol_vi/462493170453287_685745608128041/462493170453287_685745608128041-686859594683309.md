   "message": "chris said in court he was either, not the name, and/or not surety, and ended up leaving court at that. the court issued a warrant, including a note that says he skipped, so no 'discount' on bail. i think they use the word recognizance when they only ask for 10%. i think its personal surety to show up when told.\n\nan issued drivers license was at the time suspended, i think it still is.",
