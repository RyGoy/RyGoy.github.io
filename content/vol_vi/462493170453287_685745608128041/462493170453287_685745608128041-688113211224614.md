   "message": "I noticed that Michael Rivera deposited a separate and original, not a notarized copy, birth certificate bond for each of his individual charges, notated each BC bond as an exhibit, and all of his charges were dropped. Two charges, two original birth certificate bonds.  Chris just last week deposited an original birth certificate into his file, prior to last week he had deposited notarized copies...I believe Chris may now emulate Micheal's process.",
