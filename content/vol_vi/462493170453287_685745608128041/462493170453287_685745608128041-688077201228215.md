   "message": "Kirsten Carlstrom, I can see why would some might \"believe\" a private chat with the \"judge\" in the \"back office\" may be a \"diplomatic\" thing to do, and maybe do a \"hush-hush\" deal with him. \n\nBut first of all, it's a chamber for THEM, not for ME. I am not a part of \"them.\" Lawyers and liars have these private meetings there, but what does that have to do me ME, or my duties as administrator?\n\nSecondly, I think that is giving power of my affairs to someone that DOES NOT have any right to them. It's buying into the lie. \n\nIf I am truly the administrator, there is absolutely no reason for ME to  go into their \"chambers.\" They MUST provide PROOF.",
