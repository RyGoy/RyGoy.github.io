   "message": "When Chris is put in front of another justice (administrator), tell him to ask if he has an oath of office. He should say \"yes\". So Chris should, ON THE RECORD acknowledge that oath. If Chris is attempting to justify his right to travel, then you also have to require anyone there with proof of claim as in an injured party. After the acknowledgement of oath, he should not allow the justice to step in as administrator.",
