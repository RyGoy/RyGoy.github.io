   "message": "Ok....so I am reading through these comments.  For clarification, I most certainly asked \"By what authority do you attach a name derived from a Public Document to me?\" at least 8 times in Kourt at the arrest.  The lying sack of shit said \"William Weld appointed me in 1993...blah blah blah\"  I still said \"that doesn't answer my question...and until my question is answered, I cannot understand the nature and cause of the charges against me\".  I was shortly after dragged out of there while saying \"for the record, there are questions before the Kourt that are unanswered.\"\n\nAlso, Mackximus Minimus, I will murder you and not think twice about it.  :-P",
