   "message": "NEWARK � Two corrections officers and a former Essex County prosecutor were charged today with smuggling marijuana and cell phones into a pretrial lockup for federal inmates at the Essex County Jail, Newark federal prosecutors say.\n\nEssex County corrections officers Stephon Solomon, 26, of Irvington and Channel Lespinasse, 25, of Florham Park were charged with smuggling contraband, including cell phones and marijuana, into the Newark facility. Solomon was arrested at his home this morning and Lespinasse was issued a summons to appear in court on June 2.\n\nAlso arrested today was attorney Brian Kapalin, 66, of Maplewood, who left the Essex County Prosecutor�s Office in 2003 after nearly 20 years of service.\n\nProsecutors say Kapalin, in exchange for cash payouts, handed off marijuana to an inmate in an attorney conference room at the facility in January.\n\nAs it turned out, the unidentified inmate had been cooperating with the FBI in the hopes of obtaining a favorable outcome for a pending federal criminal case, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court by FBI Special Agent Karen Veltri.\n\nThe marijuana was wrapped inside a white t-shirt together with rolling papers and matches along with two wrapped packages of tobacco, the complaint adds.\n\nIn a conversation recorded at the Hudson County Jail a few days before, Kapalin � referred to as �Unc� by his alleged cohorts -- was heard discussing with an inmate a plan to deliver drugs to another inmate at the Essex County lockup, prosecutors say.\n\n�According to the complaints, the defendants operated a contraband marketplace with the walls of the Essex County Correctional Facility,� said New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman. �Jails are no place for drugs and illicit phones and it is disappointing that two corrections officers and an attorney allegedly used their authority and access to make them available.�\n\nSix others linked to the scheme have also been charged, among them several current and former federal inmates and their family members.\n\nA search of the facility on Tuesday turned up nine hidden cell phones, including one tucked away in a light fixture in the ceiling of an inmate�s cell, prosecutors say.\n\nEssex County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo applauded the work of FBI agents and federal prosecutors for, he said, �answering our request for help.�\n\n�The Essex County Correctional Facility is recognized as a model institution and we have zero tolerance when the security of our institution is jeopardized by corrections officers who abuse their positions, attorneys who exploit privileges and inmates who break our rules,� DiVincenzo said. �Their aggressive pursuit and diligence to investigate and secure evidence of this illegal activity will help restore the safety of our institution and sends a clear message of how seriously we take these matters.�\n\nProsecutors say Solomon � referred to as �Ole Boy� on jailhouse recordings � smuggled cell phones, tobacco and marijuana to inmate Qasim Nichols, 29, on five different occasions between October 2013 and April 2014 in exchange for cash.\n\nNichols� friends, Darsell Davis, 28, and Dwayne Harper, 30, aided the operation by collecting up the items to be smuggled into the jail, prosecutors say. During one jailhouse conversation obtained by the FBI, Nichols encourages Davis to combine several packages of tobacco into a ball so that it can easily be smuggled into the jail, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nDavis promised that the package would be the size of �half a sub sandwich,� the complaint adds.\n\nNichols is facing federal charges stemming from a May 2012 carjacking of a 2005 BMW in Union County, according to court records.\n\nOver the past year, several Essex County jail officers have found themselves in legal trouble.\n\nIn February, Essex County prosecutors charged corrections officer Keon Chapman with possessing contraband after they say he was caught leaving work with a small stash of marijuana.\n\nThe same month, a jury in state Superior Court in Newark convicted Officer Carlton Clark of aggravated assault for viciously pummeling a female inmate � an attack captured by jailhouse video cameras.",
