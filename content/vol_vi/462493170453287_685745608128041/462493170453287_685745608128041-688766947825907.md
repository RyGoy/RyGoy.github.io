   "message": "Ok....here is how I see it.  The Constitution is a TRUST INSTRUMENT held by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  The Commonwealth has rules for executing their duties conferred in the Instrument....they use PERSONS.  I see the DEPOSIT of the PERSON at BIRTH was the deposit into their CORPUS making me the Sole Beneficiary of a Public Document.  I granted that right to be held in a TRUST.  \n\nThey have accused me of acting as a PERSON...ie, and AGENT of the COMMONWEALTH.  \n\nFurther, there are 22 registered entitiies on D&B called \"THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS\", therefore, I have no idea which one is bringing a suit against my person.  \n\nThis question has been posed and ignored.",
