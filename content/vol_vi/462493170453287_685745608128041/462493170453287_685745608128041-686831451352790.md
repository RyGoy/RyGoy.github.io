   "message": "Max, your first paragraph began with, \"I want to formally apologize\" to Alexandra.  Your second paragraph, was, \"Blah, blah\".  Then, your third paragraph was \"Blah, blah\".  \n\nYour fourth paragraph, \"Sue believes that the only man that can make a joke about sex to a woman, or a joke about \"boat bunnies\" is Scott Duncan, or other members of the group.\"\n\nMax, that is incorrect!  Scott can say whatever he wishes as this is HIS GROUP.........HIS PAGE aka HIS Boat Bunnies....\n\nI will apologize for calling you a \"Greasy Spic\".  I only did so as you became so foul mouthed and I thought you deserved it.  Now, we ALL know you deleted and edited what you actually said, WHY DID YOU DO THAT?  Especially, after you wrote such a loving letter on the very same topic of NOT DELETING OUR POSTS?  \n\nI will absolutely apologize for getting \"My Nose up in your business\".  You are absolutely correct on that and I will never do so again.  That was TOTALLY my fault.  \n\nFor the record, NO....I will NOT admit to being a \"bitch ass stupid cunt\" to you....it is not deserved.\n\nI do offer my apology for being \"Up in your Business\".  It will never happen again and I FORGIVE YOU TOO!!!   Much love and kisses from me!!  \n\nAnd.......from, \"Perry Mason\"........:p",
