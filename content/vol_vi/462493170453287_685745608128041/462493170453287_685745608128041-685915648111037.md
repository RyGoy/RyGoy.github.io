   "message": "Alexandra, do you know if Chris wants you to bail him out?  I see you are getting to meet with him this evening and he will tell you what he needs you to do.  In the meantime, call around to several Bail Bondsman and ask questions.  \n\nAsk how much you need to pay to get the $5,000 bond to get him released.  It is usually a couple of hundred dollars or a percentage of the bail amount or it may be other property.  Ask the bondsman how bail works.  I wished I could help more, but I've never had to deal with bail before.\n\nThe Bondsman will be SURETY for the PERSON accused of a crime as far as insuring the DEFENDANT shows up for the PERSONS court date.  Chris will know this and it is difficult, if not impossible, for him to do much while behind bars.   Hope this helps.....",
