   "message": "Preamble to the Massachusetts Constitution:\n\nThe end of the institution, maintenance, and administration of government, is to secure the existence of the body politic, to protect it, and to furnish the individuals who compose it with the power of enjoying in safety and tranquility their natural rights, and the blessings of life: and whenever these great objects are not obtained, the people have a right to alter the government, and to take measures necessary for their safety, prosperity and happiness.\n\nIs it not my natural right to benefit from a deposit I made into a bank?  Or do they have the right to steal it and treat me like a slave?",
