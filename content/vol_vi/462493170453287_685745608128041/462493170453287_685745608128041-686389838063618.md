   "message": "Absolutely correct Eamonn and in fact the last real critical thinkers this country produced were members of the I.R.B. who produced the two outstanding documents The Proclaimation and the Bunreacht na h�ireann (Sovereign Constitution) that was ratified on 21st January 1919 (Irelands Independance day) and the sovereign government lasted until 1922 when the King himself no less came to �ire and offered the government of Ireland act with the phrase \"immediate and bloody war\" if you decline. Since then �ire has a provisional government  under the King and his successors. All this information has been airbrushed out of history here. However the IRB still exist and the sovereign seal is turned every year without fail on Jan 21st since 1919 to renew the sovereignty.",
