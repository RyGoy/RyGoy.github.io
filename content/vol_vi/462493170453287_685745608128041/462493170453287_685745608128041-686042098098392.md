   "message": "The categories of the Napoleonic Code were not drawn from earlier French laws, but instead from Justinian's sixth-century codification of Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis and, within it, the Institutes. The Institutes divide law into the law of:\npersons\nthings\nactions.\n\nSimilarly, the Napoleonic Code divided law into law of:\npersons\nproperty\nacquisition of property\ncivil procedure (removed into a separate code in 1806).",
