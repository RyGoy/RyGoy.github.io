   "message": "I don't want to add a stain to this thread.  I'm just wondering, if what I read is true, it would be great if Scott Duncan could weigh in on this.  The judge is, as Mackximus Minimus has stated, \" a lying sack of shit\"  and the entire system is designed to strip people of their rights.  So, when Chris was dragged into court and began asking questions and bringing up surety, this threatened their system.  Is it possible that if Chris would have asked to convene in the judges chamber, could he have administrated the charges from the chamber instead of being thrown back into jail for the weekend?  If I had the option of administrating in the judges chamber instead of being thrown back into jail, I'd take the option of administrating and be done with the whole thing.",
