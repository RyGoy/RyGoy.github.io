   "message": "Eamonn, you have to understand American \"culture\". They have no history but their own. Ask them what the IRA stood for, and they think \"Duh, terrists or sumpin'\".\n\nThey haven't seen an invasion since 1812, and it was CANADA (where we kicked their asses all the way to the white house...and then burnt it down. They've fixed it up since then. It looks really nice.)\n\nThey were a BOLD EXPERIMENT, and it failed. Now they just consume. They will arm themselves to protect their STUFF. They will never use it to protect their rights.",
