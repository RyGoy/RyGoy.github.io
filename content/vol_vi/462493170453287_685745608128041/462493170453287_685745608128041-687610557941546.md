   "message": "Alex, who is planning to be there tomorrow. IF court starts at 9, and it is packed (as i expect it to be tomorrow) then they might bring him up/in at ~ 9:30-10:30 or later. I have a nooner in medford, which is not to far south of ipswich.\n\nI met chris one day at ipswich, however he was in/out before i got to the courthouse. he said it was right up the road, but unless i actually see it, i can walk right by it. not allways but i worry i might, so because of that it could happen. I might think it was a bank by mistake.\n\ni made it up past the fairgrounds, i know where that is. on Rt. 1?",
