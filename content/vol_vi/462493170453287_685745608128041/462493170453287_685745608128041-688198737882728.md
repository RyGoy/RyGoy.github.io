   "message": "Beverly \"When Chris is put in front of another justice (administrator), tell him to ask if he has an oath of office. He should say \"yes\". So Chris should, ON THE RECORD acknowledge that oath. If Chris is attempting to justify his right to travel, then you also have to require anyone there with proof of claim as in an injured party. After the acknowledgement of oath, he should not allow the justice to step in as administrator.\"\n\nHe has more than one oath....I require the one that says something to the effect of \"uphold the public trust\".  And I asked the last JUSTICE I was in front of to put this on the record....he DECLINED.  Yes....he DECLINED to put his oath on the Public Record!",
