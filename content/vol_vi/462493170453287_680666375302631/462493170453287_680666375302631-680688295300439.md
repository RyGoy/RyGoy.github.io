   "message": "I wonder how valuing the time of others time appreciates over time?\n\nThis is a great example from Kevin Slavin:\n\"The algorithms of Wall Street are dependent on one quality above all else, which is the speed. The algorithms operate on milliseconds and microseconds. It takes you 500,000 microseconds just to click a mouse.  In New York people are hollowing out skyscrapers -- throwing out all the infrastructure for human use and installing stacks of servers for running those algorithms. Because people, inch for inch and pound for pound and dollar for dollar, will not produce what algorithms can produce in a microsecond.\"",
