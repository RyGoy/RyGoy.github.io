   "message": "CHRIS was issued a Citation as OWNER of a VEHICLE which is actually OWNED and REGISTERED by a corporation.  So....I am not sure how I would like to proceed....\n\nA.) I could refuse the Citation as CHRIS is not a PARTY to the transaction.  (But, they may just issue it to the PARTY and that PARTY doesn't have the same benefits CHRIS does)\n\nB.) I could (as Sole Authorized Administrator) accept the Citation for the party with SURETY and let them know who that is.\n\nC.) I could send a CHECK from the ACCOUNT of the corporation.\n\nD.) I could ignore it and hope they forget about it.\n\nHow do YOU think I should proceed?  :-D :-D",
