   "message": "Pretty much. The Admiral doesn't particularly like \"dumbing down\" his conversations, and he talks VERY fast. I need the Admiral doing Admiral stuff. That's all.\n\nKenny can't get any more out of Scott than he already has. Scott Duncan is all about securing and ditching the name. YOU (Pete Daoust) have mastered \"administration\". He's better suited for that.\n\nOn that note; I just want to remind everyone that when you call AQUILAE phones, the calls are recorded and accessible by EVERYONE IN THE FLEET. Don't EVER think you are having a \"private conversation\" with Scott, because you are NOT!",
