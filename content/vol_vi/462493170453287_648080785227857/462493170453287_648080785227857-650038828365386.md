   "message": "Scott Duncan,  Mackximus Minimus I wanted to know what they were, and if the letter and numbers should be included on a Bill of Exchange.  Two people I know who have had success with their BoEs have included them on their BoEs.  Several other people I know, here in the states, are having difficulty with the beneficiaries accepting their BoEs, and the BoEs they have completed did not include the letter and numbers on the back of their Social Security card.  If the letter on the back of the Social Security card is indeed one of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, here in the states, should our BoEs include that information?  Does it matter?",
