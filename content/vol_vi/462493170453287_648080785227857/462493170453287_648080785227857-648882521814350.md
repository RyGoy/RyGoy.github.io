   "message": "Acceptor Supra protest:  my understanding that 'Me' the MAN, acting as the lawful holder in due course of the PERSON (who all commerce is directed at), 'Me' can accept on behalf of the PERSON (in Australia's clubhouse Bills of Exchange Act, it is called acting as an accommodation party)...\n\nAs it's ALL about accounting and surety, by accepting supra protest (on an inchoate instrument) and then completing the instrument, 'Me' is helping the clubhouse balance their books against the correct account (the PERSON).\n\nWhat they then do with this (to discharge/setoff or whatever) is up to them & has nothing to do with 'Me'...\n\nAnd as Captain Pete Daoust likes to say...and it's not my fault :P",
