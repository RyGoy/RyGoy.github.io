   "message": "In my thinking, after numerous discussions here, around the buck o five thing, is that it is a valid thing in THIER PRIVATE CLUBHOUSE...\nThe Bill of exchange act ( clubhouse rules) covers stamps and such.\nAll I know is I am not qualified to play in their fucking clubhouse.\nI do not want to play in their fucking private clubhouse, by implementing, buck o five, I am engaging in their private clubhouse, if I fall for any of their numerous tricks in creating joinder ( which buck o five does) I am liable to be thrown in the crowbar hotel. I do not wish this.\n (My first cell mate was a FOB ( fresh of the boat- jail lingo for gangs of immigrants) Named Moses's who only read the bible...)\nSo learning to admin existing trust created at birth is the key...\nI seemed to have missed this simple point.  \nSo crypto currency removes any joinder, leaning to admin this person I happen to have in my back pocket, lessens the debt. I was mistaken in my previous approach as I do not know enough to be qualified in their place of business.\nAll I know is it is none of mine.  \nSo learn about this if you want...\nIt seems to engage with those I want to disengage with...\nThey are masters of terror and intimidation.\nBy creating a private trust... I am creating own clubhouse... guess what?\nThey do not fucking care... \nVOID.",
