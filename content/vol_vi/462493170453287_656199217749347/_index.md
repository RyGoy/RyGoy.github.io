   "message": "It is my understanding that DISCHARGE is payment of an obligation via money or some other valuable thing, OR there is no claim. \n\nIf, for instance a person was to lien a court file re: bank claim for a credit card or line of credit... and that person received notice of discharge of that lien, this would be construed as the claim was dropped ï¿½that there is no claim from the bank?",
