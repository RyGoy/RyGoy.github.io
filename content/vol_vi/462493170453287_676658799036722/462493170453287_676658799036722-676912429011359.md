   "message": "Can i claim and name that which is exclusive to myself and no other within a society....(shrugs) sure....my breath, my heartbeat, my body, my labor and it's fruits are my property, so too is my control over my cognitive ability to exercise my liberty/self determination as to how i wish to enjoy my properties.  It's pretty simple, actually...as principal, my interest appreciates public duty to uphold law by requirement or contract by consent; i.e. exercising liberty over property is not commercial...unless you want to leverage your capital to generate fiat for a corporate fiction.  That's fun too, no doubt.\n\nRegardless, if i'm not in control of that which is exclusive to me, then i suppose i'm either presumed dead and / or somebody is trying to make a slave out of me, no?  In which case, one can't really administrate ones own reality let alone another author's legal fiction that is exclusive to no one.",
