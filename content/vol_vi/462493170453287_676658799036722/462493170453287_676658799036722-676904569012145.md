   "message": "The only obligation government has to man, is to the protection of his/her property.  So, if one's status as a man requiring the restoration of property, is not in question, then one evidently hasn't authored a claim advanced before a court of record whereat a man can actually be heard (under oath or affirmation) in his undiminished \"flesh and blood\" capacity.  But if that which is exclusive to a man; property, is not on the table, then you're dealing with rights to usufruct the fuck out of some fictional instrument in commerce.  That's where groups like this attempt to educate with regards to navigating such fictions.....as debt is fiction / future speculation / a promise to perform / a contract....it's not capital, debt / contract compels the performance of capital.  Hence the term tender for law",
