   "message": "HAahaha...it's interesting the hostility one receives from those who fail to back their own opinionated assertions with factual claims.  :)  Typical, but interesting none the less, seeing as it amounts to whining.\n\nBut we all know whiners can't make claims, they have to settle for filing complaints in a diminished capacity before an administrative venue.  So by all means, kiddos, whine to your little hearts out to your superior Guru and file your complaints like any self respecting plaintiff would.\n\nSee, when it comes to the reality that man creates and convokes the assembly of government, facts are facts.  And none of you have made a claim of any fact to the contrary....(shrugs) sure, your opinions do just fine for backing a whiner's complaint...but complaints have no standing before a verified claim to the contrary.\n\nSeems y'all would've figured that out by now.  Oh well....cheers!\n\nhttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plaintiff&allowed_in_frame=0",
