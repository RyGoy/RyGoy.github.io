   "message": "I'm not saying anything about you, Pete.  The only thing i can claim about you, is whether or not you trespassed upon my property, or broke a verified contract with me.  Otherwise, it's up to you to define yourself however you elect by your own determination, no?\n\nOn that note, if one by his/her own determination decides that they have no status as a man, good for them!  Mr State Agent can presume there's property abandoned \"at sea\", giving the state the right to usufruct the shit out of that abandoned property via the otherwise non administered fiction.....because dead men can't navigate in commerce, right?  So let the state handle your affairs/property if you're not man enough to do so yourself...play dead.",
