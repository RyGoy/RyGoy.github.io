   "message": "David Grant you have been lied to. The Birth Certificate is not YOU. But it is yours. You can be BENEFICIARY of the NAME or you can be SURETY for the NAME. You've been taught to be SURETY by your slave masters. But you can be BENEFICIARY if you say so. And NO ONE can say any different. The birth certificate is a PERSON. Its not YOU. Its your PERSON. The government is SURETY for that PERSON. It says so on the document. But what \"THEY\" want is for you to be a good slave and accept SURETY. Why would you do that? It boils down to commercial contracts. My best advice for you at this point would be DON'T SIGN SHIT! And figure out what's being said here......",
