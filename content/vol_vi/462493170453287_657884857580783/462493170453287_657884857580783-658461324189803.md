   "message": "Is the purpose of quoting the criminal code & informing the fucktard that they have broken a clubhouse rule to:\n\nA.  Actually pursue a conviction/appeal to the rapist?\n\nOr\n\nB.  The same as slapping a growling dog on the nose & telling it to get back in its' box?\n\nI doubt A is practical but B could be effective enough with corporate employees etc to tell them that they're ignorant/lying sacks of shit & that we are onto them & wont put up with their crap.\n\nIf they continue to pursue a matter (Bill of Exchange) that has already been dealt with, and they're knowingly committing an offence, then most corporate shitheads will probably back off...just my opinion.",
