   "message": "I had a collector call today. I told him I didn't buy back public debts. He said the debt in question was not a public debt. So I asked him how I could help administrate the thing. He said send cash? cheque ,or money order, or use a credit card. I told him I have no cheque accout no credit card and no money, then asked how i could discharge this debt via the persons surety. :-D. He told me the ONLY way was with MONEY. I asked him if i could have that in writing. He replied \"we don't have letters like that\" haha so I told him to write the letter and sign it under full commercial liability himself. He hung up on me. :-/",
