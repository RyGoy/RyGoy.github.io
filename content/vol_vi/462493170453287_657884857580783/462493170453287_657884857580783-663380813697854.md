   "message": "Here's a way to work out who YOU are not:\n\nIf I take your birth certificate & punch it, stab it with a knife & set fire to it, do YOU get bruised, bleed or burned?\n\nThe obvious answer is NO because YOU are not the birth certificate.\n\nYOU are not the name on the birth certificate.\n\nIn the same way, ALL documents such as passports, driver licences, Social Security Cards, Medicare cards etc are derived from the one foundational document, the Birth Certificate.\n\nIf YOU are not the Birth Certificate, then it is also impossible for YOU to be any document derived from the Birth Certificate...\n\nSo that is who YOU are not.\n\nLook at the Birth Certificate:\n\nWho created it? (On the one in my possession, it is the State of New South Wales Department of Births, Deaths and Marriages), says so right at the top.\n\nWho is surety for that thing?  A guy signed as surety, acting in the capacity of Registrar. (Not ME).\n\nWhen was that document created (the one I have was created 19 days after I came into the world, so it can't be ME).\n\nThe state named that document in a very similar way to the name I use, and they sent it to ME.\n\nAs the holder of that Birth Certificate, and as the only (sole) person authorised to use it (administrate), my only possible role would be that of the Sole Authorised Administrator for the (entity) person that the government created 19 days after I was born.\n\nIn the past, I may have mistakenly assumed that person THEY (the government) created, was ME.  That would be a mistake, so please forgive me.\n\nThe government (cops, court etc) often presumes that I am acting AS the person whereas I am acting FOR the person...that too would be a mistake, so please forgive me.\n\nIt's that mistake that is addressed in the Notice of Mistake, because THEY can only deal with entities of their own creation.\n\nHope that helps :D",
