   "message": "So a BILL OF EXCHANGE is a VALUABLE SECURITY, right ? :/\n\nValuable security-- The  words �valuable security� denote a document which is, or purports to be, a document where by any legal right is created, extended, transferred, retracted, extinguished or released, or where by any person acknowledges that he lies under legal liability , or has not a certain legal right.\n\nExample:    \nX writes his name on the back of a bill of exchange. As the effect of this endorsement is to transfer the right to the bill to any person who may become the lawful holder of it the endorsement is a �valuable security�.\n\nSo now we have this super duper Criminal Code. :)\n\nCriminal Code � April 2, 2014\n\n340.\nEvery one who, for a fraudulent purpose, destroys, cancels, conceals or obliterates\n\na) a document of title to goods or lands,\n\nb). a valuable security or testamentary in-\nstrument, or\n\nc). a judicial or official document,\n\nis guilty of an indictable offence and liable to\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding ten\nyears\n\nSo no one can destroys, cancels, conceals or obliterates COMPLETED bill of exchange, right ?\n\nAm I right here or I am just jerking off :D\n\nHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! :D",
