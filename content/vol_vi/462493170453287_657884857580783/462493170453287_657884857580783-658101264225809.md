   "message": "Pete, I am sure if you ask/apply for an investigation directly to the lowest ranking criminals of the gang, nothing will happen. That's the standard procedure. Like when you go into a police to file a complaint against the police. It ain't happening.\n\nI think administrators take matters on their own hands, and send a sworn complaint, with an affidavit to the the attorney general, and/or one of those middle ranking paper pushers, that can actually fire people. I would sent it everywhere, shit, even to the governor. That should start an investigation. Some invoices attached would not be a bad idea, from a business point of view.\n\nNow, I heard a wise man saying something about not pleading to your rapist, so I'll leave it at that.",
