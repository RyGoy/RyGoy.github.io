   "message": "So, the person that my wife happens to have, and that I happen to administrate, received from the IRS a \"PROPOSAL for a change of tax and or credits on your tax return. \n\nThis is not an audit. Your return may be examined in the future... This is not a bill, but you so need to respond within 30 days or we will the appropriate changes to your account.\" \n\nThe funny/fucked-up part is that they give no reason to do this. The part of the communication were it says: \"REASON (S) FOR THE CHANGE:                       \" was left blank! Hahaha! :D\n\nSo, the person she happens to have is entitled to a 3,000USD refund. They are PROPOSING to keep it, for no reason. \n\nAs a responsible administrator, that is one PROPOSAL I must happily decline! :D\nIt's time to administrate some bullshit! :D\n\n<<PROPOSAL. An offer for consideration or acceptance. \n     2. It is a general rule that a proposal offered to another for acceptance may be withdrawn at any time before it is accepted, provided that notice of the withdrawal be given to the party to whom it was made.
