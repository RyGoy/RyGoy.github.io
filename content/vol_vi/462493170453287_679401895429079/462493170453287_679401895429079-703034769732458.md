   "message": "No, Gerry Odonothing, let me explain what happened here.\n\nMy wife's PERSON got a PROPOSAL. Look the definition. As the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR she has the power to decide for the PERSON WHEN to contract, OR NOT to contract. \n\nIf the offer is to FUCK HER, the OFFER is RETURNED NOT ACCEPTED, because I AM already doing ALL the fucking. So she decided it was for the best INTEREST of her PERSON to return that OFFER. \n\nThe SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR stuffed their whole PROPOSAL to FUCK HER  (envelope, and all) and returned it, with a PROPER NOTICE (Please refer to PROPER NOTICE FOR IDIOTS, written by Admiral Scott) via REGISTERED MAIL, giving INSTRUCTIONS to FUCK OFF with their OFFER. \n\nWhen you send NOTICE via REGISTERED MAIL,  you are POSTING a BILL, and in fact sending a TENDER FOR LAW. \n\nAn affirmation from the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR with the TRUTH, was inluded. Just in case someone over there had any doubts of WHO is the Administrator for the PERSON. Exhibits with PROOF of SURETY where attached.\n\nSo, you see, is not just a \"letter,\" or a \"No thanks.\" There is an entire process to leave no space for ANYONE to questions anything provided, because IT IS THE TRUTH! :D ALL of it! :D",
