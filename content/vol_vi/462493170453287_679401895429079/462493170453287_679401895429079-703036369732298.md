   "message": "Tax agents don't work on commission, so how are they feeding their kids with what they take from others?  They cash a paycheck, yes, but just like cops, most of them don't have a clue about what they're doing.  When they get letters saying what you guys are saying they MAY go ask a supervisor who also doesn't have a clue who tells them what to do then they move on to the next case in their huge pile.",
