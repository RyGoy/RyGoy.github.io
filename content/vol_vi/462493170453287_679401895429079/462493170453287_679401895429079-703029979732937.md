   "message": "Do you think the average tax agent has any clue about what you wrote? To them, everyone is a \"taxpayer\", and they can only receive things from and send things to taxpayers. My guess is they saw that the offer was declined, looked into it and decided they had nothing to support their claim.  If they actually understood your intent/claimed position and wanted to be dicks about it they could have said that the taxpayer didn't respond at all as required and proceeded to take the refund. Anyway I'm glad it worked out.  And no I'm not a \"government worker\".. such \"lingo\" leads me to believe you're paranoid-delusional.  Just sayin', \"Mackximus.\"",
