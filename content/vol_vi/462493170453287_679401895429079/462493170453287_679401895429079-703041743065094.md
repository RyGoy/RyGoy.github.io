   "message": "Dan Wilson, we are  here to help others learn, in an extreme unconventional way. If you are here to learn (not \"get convinced\"), I can try to help. I am not the best at it, but I can give it a shot.\n\nYou were added to this group last Thursday. Here NOBODY is trying to convince ANYONE of ANYTHING. You feel you have some \"struggle.\" What specifically have you read (since Thursday), that is causing you any struggle? What part of the information? Maybe I can explain better, if you really want to learn.",
