   "message": "I know I wasn't asked, but here's my 2 cents:\n\nWrite to the court (in capacity as the Sole Authorised Administrator), requesting a stay of 30 days because it is your wish to settle this matter peacefully.\n\nYou have specifically requested some documents to validate the alleged debt that have not been forthcoming and you sincerely hope that the claimant/plaintiff will assist you in settling the matter peacefully.\n\nAfter all, as an honourable and honest man, you do not wish to waste the court's time and agree with the maxim 'there ought to be an end to litigation'.\n\nThis communication demonstrates your wish to resolve the matter and avoid controversy.  It will also give time to default them for not providing the required information in order to validate the alleged debt.",
