   "message": "Scott, when my brother reserved all rights, he said the supernumerary opened her eyes like two big lamps, and staring objecting, when asked for any objections from the court. \n\nHe is new at this, and he knows very little. The \"judge\" is not a person. She could not had objected. That is what I think. She has no standing to object. Am I correct?\n\nWhat would you say to a supernumerary that would try to object your reservation of rights?",
