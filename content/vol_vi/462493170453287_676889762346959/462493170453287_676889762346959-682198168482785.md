   "message": "<<NOTICE OF CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE, UPON PROOF OF CLAIM\nUnited States Postal Service Registered Mail RB 576 322 XXX US\n\nTAKE NOTICE THAT I am a Man, I happen to be the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, and it is not my fault.\n\nI am NOT HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, and I am NOT SURETY for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS. PROOF of who is SURETY for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS is provided by the ESTADO LIBRE ASOCIADO DE PUERTO RICO, as being the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY in the SURETY BOND with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL NAME, in a BIRTH CERTIFICATE/PUBLIC RECORD # XXXXXXXX, with REGISTRATION DATE of XXXXX, and SSN XXXXXXXXXX.\n\nIf I have led ANYONE to believe that I am SURETY, and/or a SLAVE, and/or an OFFICER, and/or an AGENT, and/or a TRUSTEE, and/or an EMPLOYEE of/for THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and/or ESTADO LIBRE ASOCIADO DE PUERTO RICO, and/or GOBIERNO DE PUERTO RICO, then that would be a MISTAKE. Please forgive me.\n\nThank you for your NOTICE for a hearing/business meeting to be held on JUNE 24th 2014, Room 508, at 9:00. As the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, I am conditionally accepting any claims upon proof of claim. If HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS has any pending BILL, I want to administrate this debt, and/or settle any lawful outstanding bills, as soon as possible. \n\nBeing the only party with INTEREST on this matter, and the only party with STANDING, I will administrate this matter in �Special Appearance�, and in the capacity of amicus curiae/�Friend of the Court�, NOT as DEFENDANT and/or any other capacity and/or title. I must be addressed as �Administrator� and/or �Sir,� and will be the SOLE Administrator for all matters concerning HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS in that meeting, unless I give POWER to a TRUSTEE by APPOINTMENT to make sure my INSTRUCTIONS are followed by ANY PUBLIC EMPLOYEE in this BUSINESS meeting. Should any other party, other than MYSELF, be present and/or try to administrate this matter without MY authorization, I will require identification, and PROOF of their capacity, and standing.\n\nIt is my DUTY to inform, as SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, that at least three (3) NOTICES requesting a BILL have been sent in GOOD FAITH to RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC, because our accounting does not have any outstanding bills in the name RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. A first notice requesting a BILL was received by RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. on February 14th, 2014, the second one was received by March 24th 2014, and a third one was received on May 27th 2014. Copy of the notices attached.\n\nHowever, RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. has never send any BILL, despite many attempts to settle any outstanding BILLS. There is no controversy here. Why is RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.  creating controversy? If there is a debt, just send the BASIC information needed to administrate that alleged debt, like a BILL. As soon as this information is provided, the debt will be administrated. How can I do accounting without a BILL? �Bill: A declaration in writing. A document listing separate items. An itemized account of charges or costs.�\n\nI have been trying in GOOD FAITH and HONOUR to administrate this debt, and settle any accounting. Doing this administration work involves the use of my TIME, which is the only thing of VALUE that I have. \n\nAs YOU are aware, involuntary servitude and/or slavery is a crime.  So far I have done this administration work FOR FREE. I have been trying to settle the account, and you are not providing the information needed in order to administrate any alleged debt. So, BE NOTICED that any/all administration work regarding HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS are subject to FEES, which will be INVOICED. \n\nThe administration FEES for assisting to an invitation/notification for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS to appear in court/business meeting are $5,000.00 USD per �appearance�.  Additionally, a fee of $500.00USD per hour or fraction thereof, for any administration work done for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, may also apply. Should you choose to do business with HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLASOS, you are in agreement, and you may expect an invoice after the every administration work is completed.\n\nTherefore: If a BILL is not presented at the hearing/business meeting, I, as the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR, must keep considering a settled matter, until proven otherwise, that no debt exists, and/or that any/all accounting is settled and/or closed with RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC., and it is my WISH to give INSTRUCTIONS for this account/case K CM2014-1915 to be closed/dismissed with prejudice. Have I made my wishes clear?\n\nAny questions regarding this NOTICE, please contact, ONLY IN WRITING, the administration offices for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLASOS at: XXXXXXXXXXX\n\n*** End>>",
