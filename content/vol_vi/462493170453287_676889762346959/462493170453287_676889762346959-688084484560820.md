   "message": "So, my brother's person received over the mail a ruling in favour for the \"plaintiff,\", without providing ANY PROOF OF CLAIM, or BILL being presented. That is UNACCEPTABLE, from an administrative point of view, besides ILLEGAL, and FRAUD.\n\nHe has been asking for a BILL. No BILL, no fucking CLAIM! So he made a TENDER FOR LAW by sending an AFFIRMATION with everything that has happened, plus attached a new PEREMPTORY notice as an exhibit, plus attached all other notices as exhibits, as well.\n\n<< AFFIRMATION\n\nComes now, the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, hereby certify and declare that the following facts are true, and correct to the best of my knowledge:\n\n1. I am the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, BIRTH CERTIFICATE and/or SURETY BOND/PUBLIC RECORD #152-1983-06453-062556-001202, with REGISTRATION DATE of 27 DECEMBER 1983, and SSN 599-20-9920, and it is not my fault. (See Exhibit A attached)\n2. I am NOT the legal name and/or person HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS.\n3. I am NOT SURETY for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS.\n4. PROOF of who is SURETY for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS is provided by the ESTADO LIBRE ASOCIADO DE PUERTO RICO and/or GOBIERNO DE PUERTO RICO/GOVERNMENT OF PUERTO RICO, as being the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY in the SURETY BOND with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL NAME, in a BIRTH CERTIFICATE/PUBLIC RECORD #152-1983-06453-062556-001202, with REGISTRATION DATE of 27 DECEMBER 1983, and SSN 599-20-9920. (See Exhibit B attached)\n5. I am not a SLAVE, and/or an OFFICER, and/or a government AGENT, and/or a TRUSTEE, and/or a Government EMPLOYEE of/for the CROWN and/or THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and/or ESTADO LIBRE ASOCIADO DE PUERTO RICO and/or GOBIERNO DE PUERTO RICO. (See attached Exhibit B)\n6. I am NOT a SLAVE to ANYONE.\n7. I do not recognize and/or authorize ANY authority outside of ME.\n8. There is no authority to attach any LEGAL NAME, and/or ANY information, derived from any public document to ME.\n9. I will NOT buy back any public debts that come under the legal name HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS.\n10. As the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, I will only ADMINISTRATE these public debts, and send them back to the beneficiary, so they can be presented to the FEDERAL RESERVE BANK and/or to which ever pertinent party, for complete discharge.\n11. All the administration done for the legal name/person HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS is subject to FEES.\n12. As the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, I assisted to a hearing/business meeting held on JUNE 24th 2014, Room 508, at 9:00am at TRIBUNAL DE PRIMERA INSTANCIA DE SAN JUAN, in the capacity of Administrator, as a friend of the court, and in �Special Appearance� to SETTLE any BILL.\n13. I had given notice to REBECCA RIVERA TORRES, GRETCHEN J MELENDEZ MULERO, RICARDO A VARGAS VALLE, RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. and WANDA AYALA ORTIZ that I conditionally accepted any claims upon proof of claim, IF A bill WAS PRESENTED at the business meeting/hearing. (See attached Exhibit C1 and C2)\n14. In that business meeting, NO BILL under the name HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLAZOS was presented by anyone.\n15. The SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS sent, in JUNE 23rd 2014 via e-mail to WANDA AYALA ORTIZ, PROOF from RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. (with a SIGNATURE from a duly authorized representative from RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC, named YAMIRA POLO CALDERIN) that the account 609-830254 and/or HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, by MAY 31st of 2012 had a $0.00 balance due in account 609-830254, and owes NOTHING. (See attached Exhibit D)\n16. At the business meeting the TRUSTEE, WANDA AYALA ORTIZ, NEVER instructed her PUBLIC EMPLOYEES and/or the unknown party allegedly representing REALIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. to present a BILL to HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS.\n17. WANDA AYALA ORTIZ proceeded to administrate the matters of HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS without authorization, without showing PROOF that she has authorization to do such thing, and WITHOUT the consent of the real administrator, ME.\n18. WANDA AYALA ORTIZ did not accepted/rejected and/or ignored the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR'S presence at the business meeting/hearing to settle the matter for the DEFENDANT, and stated that the DEFENDANT had not showed-up, and proceeded to rule �HA LUGAR LA DEMANDA� in favor of RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. without any PROOF of CLAIM, and without any affidavit sworn and/or subscribed by any party supporting RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC's lawsuit/claim.\n19. The SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS reserves the right to VOID any unauthorized ORDER/SENTENCIA, and any/all unauthorized ORDERS/�SENTENCIAS� will be returned as �VOID� and/or �NOT ACCEPTED.�\n20. The SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS reserves the right to LIEN the case/account K CM2014-1915.\n21. I, as the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR, must keep considering a settled matter, until proven otherwise, that no debt exists, and/or that any/all accounting is settled and/or closed with RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. See attached Exhibit E1 and E2.\n22. The SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR is the ONLY means of discharging debt for the HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS.\n23. The SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS was refused in a business meeting/hearing held on JUNE 24th 2014, Room 508, at 9:00am at TRIBUNAL DE PRIMERA INSTANCIA DE SAN JUAN, therefore, remedy has also been refused.\n\nWith nothing else to affirm for now, >>",
