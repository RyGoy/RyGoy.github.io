   "message": "<<ALL RIGHTS RESERVED   WITHOUT PREJUDICE\nNON-NEGOTIABLE\n\nPEREMPTORY NOTICE\nUnited States Postal Service Registered Mail RB 576 322 273 US\n\nTAKE NOTICE THAT I am a Man, I happen to be the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, and it is not my fault.\n\nI am NOT HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, and I am NOT SURETY for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS. PROOF of who is SURETY for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS is provided by the ESTADO LIBRE ASOCIADO DE PUERTO RICO, as being the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY in the SURETY BOND with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL NAME, in a BIRTH CERTIFICATE/PUBLIC RECORD #152-1983-06453-062556-001202, with REGISTRATION DATE of 27 DECEMBER 1983, and SSN 599-20-9920.\n\nIf I have led ANYONE to believe that I am SURETY, and/or a SLAVE, and/or an OFFICER, and/or an AGENT, and/or a TRUSTEE, and/or an EMPLOYEE of/for THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and/or ESTADO LIBRE ASOCIADO DE PUERTO RICO, and/or GOBIERNO DE PUERTO RICO, then that would be a MISTAKE. Please forgive me.\n\nIt is my DUTY to inform, as SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, that at least three (3) NOTICES requesting a BILL were sent in GOOD FAITH to RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC, because our accounting does not have any outstanding bills in the name of RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. A first notice requesting a BILL was received by RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. on February 14th, 2014, the second one was received by March 24th 2014, and a third one was received on May 27th 2014. Copy of the notices, and PROOF they were received is attached.\n\nAs the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, I assisted to a hearing/business meeting held on JUNE 24th 2014, Room 508, at 9:00am at TRIBUNAL DE PRIMERA INSTANCIA DE SAN JUAN, in the capacity of Administrator, as a friend of the court, and in �Special Appearance� to SETTLE any BILL.  I had given notice to REBECCA RIVERA TORRES, GRETCHEN J MELENDEZ MULERO, RICARDO A VARGAS VALLE, RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. and WANDA AYALA ORTIZ that I conditionally accepted any claims upon proof of claim, IF A bill WAS PRESENTED at the business meeting/hearing. There was no controversy. I just needed a BILL to administrate any debt. See attached notice for reference. \n\nWhen I showed-up to administrate this matter, NO BILL under the name HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLAZOS was presented by anyone. This Administrator sent, in JUNE 23rd 2014 via e-mail to WANDA AYALA ORTIZ, PROOF from RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. in a document (with a SIGNATURE from a duly authorized representative from RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC, named YAMIRA POLO CALDERIN) that the account 609-830254 and/or HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, by MAY 31st of 2012 had a $0.00 balance due in account 609-830254, and owes NOTHING.. I am in possession of that PROOF. A copy is attached for reference. Why was this IGNORED?\n\nAt the business meeting the TRUSTEE, WANDA AYALA ORTIZ, NEVER instructed her PUBLIC EMPLOYEES and/or the unknown party allegedly representing REALIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. to present a BILL to HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS. Instead, WANDA AYALA ORTIZ proceeded to administrate the matters of HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS without authorization, without showing PROOF that she has authorization to do such thing, and WITHOUT the consent of the real administrator, ME.\n\nI am the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, and I have PROOF, via an AFFIRMATION (that the TRUSTEE WANDA AYALA ORTIZ has in her possession), that I am IN FACT the ONLY and SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS. Nobody has rebutted that FACT.\n\nArbitrarily, and breaching the TRUST she HOLDS, the TRUSTEE WANDA AYALA ORTIZ did not accepted/rejected and/or ignored the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR'S presence at the business meeting/hearing to settle the matter for the DEFENDANT, and stated that the DEFENDANT had not showed-up, and proceeded to rule �HA LUGAR LA DEMANDA� in favor of RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. without any PROOF of CLAIM, and without any affidavit sworn and/or subscribed by any party supporting RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC's lawsuit/claim.. There was NO BILL from RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVI CES INC. presented there.\n\nI have been trying in GOOD FAITH and HONOUR to administrate any debt, and settle any accounting. Doing this administration work involves the use of my TIME, which is the only thing of VALUE that I have. \n\nAs YOU are aware, involuntary servitude and/or slavery is a crime.  So far I have done this administration work FOR FREE. So, BE NOTICED that any/all administration work regarding HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS are subject to FEES, which will be INVOICED. If for some reason another invitation for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS is received to assist to another business meeting, there will be a DEMAND for SECURITY FOR COST, at a rate of $100,000.00 dollars that must be deposited before doing business again.\n\nBe noticed that RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. will be sent an INVOICE for both the administration time of the Administrator at a rate of $500.00 dollars the hour or fraction of hour, and the $5,000.00 dollars per �appearance�, as previously agreed. (See attached notices for reference)\n\nShould HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS receive any unauthorized ORDER/�SENTENCIA� from any unauthorized party, the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS reserves the right to VOID any unauthorized ORDER/SENTENCIA, and any/all unauthorized ORDERS/�SENTENCIAS� will be returned as �VOID� and/or �NOT ACCEPTED.�  Also, the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS reserves the right to LIEN the case/account K CM2014-1915.  As the the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, I will make an AFFIRMATION with the TRUTH of everything that has occurred, and I will make another TENDER FOR LAW by POSTING A BILL for all alleged parties via Registered Mail.\n\nTherefore: Since a BILL was not presented at the hearing/business meeting, I, as the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR, must keep considering a settled matter, until proven otherwise, that no debt exists, and/or that any/all accounting is settled and/or closed with RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. Also, let the public record show that the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS was refused in a business meeting/hearing held on JUNE 24th 2014, Room 508, at 9:00am at TRIBUNAL DE PRIMERA INSTANCIA DE SAN JUAN, therefore, remedy has also been refused. Since the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR is the ONLY means of discharging debt for the HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS, and remedy has been refused, it is my WISH and INSTRUCTIONS for this account/case K CM2014-1915 to be closed/dismissed with prejudice. Have I made my wishes clear?\n\n Maxims of Law: �An Unrebutted Affidavit Stands as Truth� �If it is written, it is LAW�\n\nAny questions regarding this NOTICE, please contact, ONLY IN WRITING, the administration offices for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLASOS at: 400 Calaf Street #27, San Juan, PR 00917-1314 \nNO COMMERCE EXPECTED AND/OR IMPLIED.\n\n[Authorized by: SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLAZOS]\n*** End>>",
