   "message": "Ok, so my younger brother went to administrate this matter this morning.  Basically the supernumerary was compelling my brother to \"identify\" himself, and show show some ID. She said he could not call himself administrator, that he needed to say a name. \n\nHe stood his ground repeating he was there as the Administrator, and after trying to make him say a name, the judge railroaded him until she kicked him out from the court room, and said that she was going to say the defendant did not showed-up, and was ruling in favor of the \"plaintiff.\". They were really freaking out there. \n\nRegardless, there was no controversy, he has been asking for a bill, and none has been handed. But the judge was not having her court room show busted, by a twenty something year old kid, apparently, hahaha!\n\nScott Duncan, what do you think of this?",
