Please forgive me.\n\nThank you for your communication concerning PROMISSORY NOTE/contract/account 609-830254.  If there is a alleged debt associated with this PROMISSORY NOTE/contract/account 609-830254, I want to administrate this debt, and/or settle any lawful outstanding bills, as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, I am returning your communication as ACCEPTED/DECLINED, for clarification, and/or for more information is needed in order to administrate this alleged debt.

As soon as this information is provided, the debt will be administrated. How can I do accounting without a BILL? Who am I doing business with?\n\nI have been trying in GOOD FAITH and HONOUR to administrate this debt, and settle any accounting. Doing this administration work involves the use of my TIME, and my ENERGY, which are the only two things of VALUE that I have. \n\nAs YOU are aware, involuntary servitude and/or slavery is a crime.  So far I have done this administration work FOR FREE. I have been trying to settle the account, and you are not providing the information needed in order to administrate any alleged debt.

You have failed to provide the information needed to offer you REMEDY. \n\nTherefore: I must consider a settled matter, until proven otherwise, that no debt exists, and/or that any/all accounting is settled and/or closed with either JULIO R. CALDERIN, and /or RELIABLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. and/or RELIABLE AUTO.\n\nAny questions regarding this NOTICE, please contact, ONLY IN WRITING, the administration offices for HECTOR EUGENIO MALDONADO COLLASOS at: XXXXXXXX\n\nAuthorized by: SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for XXXXXXXXX\n\n**End",
