   "message": "So, my brother told me he would attend to the hearing to administrate this matters. He will notice the court that he is attending as the sole authorized administrator, and that he has been trying to settle this matter, but the alleged plaintiff has failed provide a bill. If a bill, and id's are not presented at the hearing, the administrator will be instructing the trustee (unauthorized administrator) to close the case with prejudice given that there is no controversy to be \"heard\".\n\nWhat do you think Captain  Pete?",
