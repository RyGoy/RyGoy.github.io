   "message": "It would be the only way to get jurisdiction, so the government will back it all the way. This is NOT \"good news\"; It's an event marker. This is when the current system \"blinks\".\n\nThe Ethereum project will likely accept! They KNOW they are the BETA TEST. Bitcoin was an ALPHA TEST. People can make up all the mythology and bullshit they want!\n\n...or you can just fork the code, and copy it. That's the beauty of it. The government and banks (and the ignorant, stupid, greedy public) will consume time effort resources \"fighting\" the prototypes, while the PRODUCTION stuff is being built quietly.\n\nThis is why we KNOW we have already won. This is just the start of MASSIVE amounts of resources going toward sabotaging a WORKING prototype. What will they have left when the REAL THING shows up? :D",
