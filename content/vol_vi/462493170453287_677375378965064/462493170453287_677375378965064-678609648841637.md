There is no deadline for learning.\n\nYou may still posses your car, even if a lien it's in place. Just keep receipt of your payment/s, and when you finish paying the $900, you instruct for the lien to be lifted.\n\nThis group can help, but in 2 months we can't make \"miracles.\" Keep reading. If you do that, you will start asking yourself the right questions.\n\nAlso, if you cannot improve someone's notice, why change it to make it worse? :/",
