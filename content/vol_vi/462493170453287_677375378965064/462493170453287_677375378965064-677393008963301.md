   "message": "Ok, when you hand out that driver's license and give it to the cops, you are admitting being an EMPLOYEE of the government......\n\nSo the best is to forget that driver's license at home....and when you get pulled over, you make SURE you are telling the cops that you are NOT surety, and you are not a government employee.......after, he can do what the fuck he wants, if he ask for a NAME, I say pierre, if he ask for ANYTHING ELSE.....\n\nI say, Oh, you want the NAME of the person I happen to have in my pocket, the one that was created by the government 16 days after my birth, and the one that the government signed as SURETY for it.....right officer ?... :D\n\nWith a VIDEO, this shit will rock !!!! :D",
