   "message": "So I got a situation. ..... I have these outstanding parking tickets .... going on 5 years now .... my wife says we got a registered letter saying there is a Lien on my truck for 900 bucks..... I have 21 days to pay. ... please correct me I'm sure there will be errors but here is what I think I should do..... send a letter back via registered mail conditionally accepting there offer upon proof of claim.... I require the original contract that we have.... also I require 2 pieces of id..... give them 10 days.... offer to administrate for free this time but any further correspondence will cost x.x .... also I require a bill ...\n\nShould I perhaps draft a NOTICE of MISTAKE send that along too?",
