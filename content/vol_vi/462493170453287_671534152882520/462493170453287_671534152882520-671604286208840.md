Kevin Annett...\" \nThe following is Kevin Annett in action.. \nI ran across him 4 years ago when I began looking for remedy ( in the past).. I saw something similar to this and moved on. \nKevin Annett was a Minister in the United Church and discovered mass graves of children on church property. \nHe then went on to exorcise the Vatican... \nHmm.. ever wonder why certain members of Parliament are called Ministers?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEvTGT9nv-o.\n\nIt doesn't make any sense to me.\nIt speaks to me of well meaning Man/Woman wrapped up in harmful beliefs. Blinded by them.\nThe system is swatting flies. The flies protest and then are gassed with Raid...\nThey believe they are right.\nThe post could possibly be named Self Sabotage...",
