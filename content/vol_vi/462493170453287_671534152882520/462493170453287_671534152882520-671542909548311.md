What is this? \n\nI get 3 things: A little side show called \"Fraud vs Fraud,\" fight night; Darren, the cop, is not planning to pay back a $2,000.00 loan and wants more money (duh!); and Dean's brokeass brother has no computer, or Internet, and has a crappy phone. Somehow, all these equal to SABOTAGE.\n\nThe Clusterfuck-To-Victory Crew has joined Dean in the batshit insane club. \n\nI cannot help, but to still feel some empathy for Dean. :/",
