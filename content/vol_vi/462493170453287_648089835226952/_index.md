   "message": "I have a debt that has been sold to a debt collection agency. I have NO contract OR business with these STRANGERS so here is my reply!! \n\nCONVERGENT HEALTHCARE RECOVERIES, INC\n\n04/02/2014\n\nP.O. BOX 5435\n\nCarol Stream, IL 60197-5435\n\nDear sir or Madam,\n\nThis letter serves to provide NOTICE of your unsigned anonymous claim of a debt in the amount of $444.80. I am not aware of any business and/or contact with your agency that would substantiate such a claim.\n\nA maxim of law states that one should know whom he/she is dealing with. Therefore any further correspondence from yourself must include a wet ink signature as well as identification substantiating who you are and your position within the agency you represent. Any correspondence lacking this basic requirement has no credibility and will be considered harassment.\n\nI conditionally accept your offer upon the completion of the following terms;\n\n1. Please provide a certified copy of the contract which validates the debt claimed to be owed to your agency.\n\n2. Please identify yourself to me as outlined above. I require government issued photographic identification. This measure must be taken to prevent fraud.\n\n3. Understand that I DO accept phone calls regarding the matter at a rate of $3500 per call attempt.\n\n4. Understand that unsigned offers shall constitute harassment and an administrative fee of $1500 shall be imposed for each unsigned offer received.\n\n5. Understand that, as I am acting in good faith, any negative reporting to any agency/credit bureau is unwarranted and tantamount to FRAUD. Any reporting to an agency/credit bureau shall incur a fee of $5500 applicable to you.\n\n6. Provide me with a BILL as well as specific instructions as to how to execute the provided instrument and DISCHARGE the debt via the PERSONS SURETY.\n\nFailure to provide me with a valid CONTRACT as well as identify yourself will leave me with no option but to assume you are a third party interloper making a FALSE CLAIM against me. I will and have made every attempt to handle this in good faith to resolve this matter for JESSAMEE HUNDLEY. Your cooperation and assitance is much appreciated.\n\nWith love and regards,\n\nJessamee Hundley \nSole Authorized Administrator",
