   "message": "Hi Mr. Mackay,\n\nIs it true that I can use the SURETY of the PERSON, I happen to have, to settle ANY public debts sent to the person I happen to have ?\n\nI�ve been administrating public debts that way, for a while, and NO ONE IS ANSWERING the question.\n\nI haven�t act as surety, for the Hydro-Quebec bill, these guys are sending to the person I happen to have, for 23 months now, and I still have electricity in the house, and NO ONE IS TOUCHING this, at Hydro-Quebec�\n\nI beg them, to say I am wrong, and if I am wrong, I WILL PAY, no one is answering.\n\nI have administrated several different public debt so far, and SAME CRAP, no one seems to want to talk about it�.\n\nI am about to go PUBLIC with all this, unless someone from the Government says I AM WRONG�\n\nThanks\nPierre \nSole AUTHORIZED Administrator for PIERRE DAOUST, the person.\n\np.s. If I was DEEMED to �be� the person, that was a mistake, and please forgive me.",
