   "message": "So.....about collapsing a banking system and starting a war. \n\nIt seems like \"they\" are setting the proverbial table for this. \"Lobbing a softball in there\"!\n\nAs I watch in real time, money flow out of fiat and into cryptos and the government maintaining and expanding their police state, it becomes very clear that this system is collapsing already. It appears that it will only need the slightest nudge at the right time, then war breaks out. \n\nHistory shows that huge wealth is always transferred via wars. Actually, it seems as if wars serve no other purpose. Well, aside from legally murdering your foes. \n\nPlanning....obviously knowledge is power, but what about a \"get the fuck out of Dodge\" plan? Where does one go?",
