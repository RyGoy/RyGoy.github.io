   "message": "Technically Jason, once you ASK for a FRN, its not like you can go back to the window and say \"Hey....can I trade these in for Lawful money pursuant to 12 USC 411\".  If you have previously offered an unrestricted signature on an Instrument in the Public and got some FRNs with it, that is the past.  The DEMAND starts once you make it...then the ACCOUNT is an account that HOLDS lawful money",
