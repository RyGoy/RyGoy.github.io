   "message": "I don't know, personally...I think it was over too quickly. A season and a half of waiting for someone to off that odious little puke, and then all he got was a nice, quick poisoning?! \n\nThis week's episode was sold as \"The most disturbing sex scene EVER broadcast on television\".
