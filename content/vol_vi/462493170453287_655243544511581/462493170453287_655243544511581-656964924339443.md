   "message": "The fact that there are TWO different dictionaries (English and Legalese) and inside those dictionaries are DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS for the words, should be all the \"PROOF\" Adam needed. Fortunately, he writes like an autistic 12 year-old so there is NO chance of him EVER having ANYONE listen to his celebration of ignorance.\n\nHere in REALITY: LEGALESE IS NOT ENGLISH. IT IS A COPYRIGHTED LANGUAGE. THE IMF IS THE COPYHOLDER. Anyone saying otherwise IS LYING TO YOU.\n\nADAM is LYING TO YOU when he says otherwise. When it conflicts with REALITY, it is a LIE. The people telling that lie need to be treated as PEOPLE WHO MEAN YOU HARM.",
