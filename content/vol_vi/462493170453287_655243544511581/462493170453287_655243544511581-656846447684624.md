   "message": "When I first wound up here I seriously did not know HOW TO THINK. Scott has given me that, FREE OF CHARGE... Not telling things, but making you think for yourself... I know there are other groups on FB that some others here are a part of but when I go to check it out... they're FREEDUMBING and not finding the BOTTOM LINE.  \n\nI can't read in those groups either. This is also a suggestion to anyone here involved in other groups as such. Just leave them if they don't include the reality and bottom line we have been shown here.",
