   "message": "But it's better to Buck-o-Five than BUYING back debts like a fool....\n\nSo therefor, the Buck-o-Five is NOT wrong, the guy that should explain it, is maybe retard, but not the Buck-o-Five :)\n\nAnd the buck-o-five brings this idea that, as a MAN, you have NO OBLIGATIONS to use LEGAL TENDERS to PAY for debts.\n\nWith Buck-o-Five, YOU are still SURETY but can use LAWFULmoney to pay.Almost look like the QUEEN is surety :D\n\nThat's how I see it. :)",
