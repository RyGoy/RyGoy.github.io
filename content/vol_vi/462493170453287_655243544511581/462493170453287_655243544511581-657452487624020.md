   "message": "\"Please explain what the TREASURY WILL GIVE YOU AS VALUABLE CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE?\"\n\nOk....very simply.  When you DEMAND lawful money, they give you a Federal Reserve Note, however, the restricted language on the fucking document you opened the Account with and the restrictive language on all deposits LIMITS what the BANK can do with your instruments.  Its not about what you see....its about what they can do.",
