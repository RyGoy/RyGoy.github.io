   "message": "Just thinking out loud here.... how can the english common language be the same than LEGALESE I mean its a language that openly and freely allows and nourishes  CONTRADICTION whereas legalese follows a specific set of rules to untangle and establish Fact or no Fact...True or False....Its Superior to Contradiction which is always False!...The question that has me buffled  Scott is what is it exactly that the IMF has copyrights too?
