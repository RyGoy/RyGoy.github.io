Mackximus Minimus...\n\nA  \"win\" over Origin Energy?\n\nTo 'quote' myself....\n\n< People. - There is one important paragraph in my original contact (as posted above - and to Origin Energy), that says:\n\n\"I reminded him of the Papal decree and briefly explained the \"Law\" that is effective from September 1st, 2013. I also reminded him that the \"I'm just doing my job\" (or, the Nuremburg 'defense'), would also, now apply to him.\"\n\nMembers should \"learn\" what this all means. Learn all of it and be confident in knowing it. Is my tip! >\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/211871612287035/419971751477019/?comment_id=426643684143159&notif_t=like",
