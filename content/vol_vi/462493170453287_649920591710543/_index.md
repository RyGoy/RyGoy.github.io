   "message": "They offered 2 of these (I have only seen this one).  This case here has seen 3 Notice of Mistakes and 2 different versions of the Birth Certificate.  Now, they have told their ARMY to come get ME again.  \n\nSince they have CHRISTOPHER EVAN SCHULTE in custody, I will refuse this offer, and let them know that should they proceed against any man any further, it will be under fraud and will, in fact, be involuntary servitude.",
