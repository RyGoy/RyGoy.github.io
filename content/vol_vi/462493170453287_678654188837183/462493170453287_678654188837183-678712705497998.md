   "message": "Whoa...whoa...I'm just commenting that it's associated with a stereotype, with origins in another realm. I am not embracing anything.\n\nLet's be very clear.\n\nPhonetically, it's harsh because of the white gaze upon it. Only your names are aurally pleasing to the ear, in your collective opinion. That is what I am discounting. White is not necessarily right just because you say so. Urban, ghetto, hood....all things labeled by whites to reduce others to subordination in name and personal characteristics. Very hard for you to embrace names not of English, Scottish, Danish, French, etc. origin. They are all inherently wrong, for whatever reason you all have decided. \n\nThat's not my business, it's just comical.\n\nNow, the fact that those using these names in greatest frequency may tend to fit that particular model..... well, :/",
