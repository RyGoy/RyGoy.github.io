   "message": "It's from The Fountainhead:\n\"It's good to suffer. Don't complain. Bear, bow, accept - and be grateful God has made you suffer. For this makes you better than the people who are laughing and happy. If you don't understand this, don't try to understand. Everything bad comes from the mind, because the mind asks too many questions. It is blessed to believe, not to understand. So if you didn't get passing grades, be glad of it. It means that you are better than the smart boys who think too much and too easily.\"\n-Ellsworth Toohey\n\nNot representative of her personal opinion, but a character in the book described as:\n\"Ellsworth Monkton Toohey, who writes a popular art criticism column, is Roark's antagonist. Toohey is Rand's personification of evil, the most active and self-aware villain in any of her novels\"",
