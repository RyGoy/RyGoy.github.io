For this makes you better than the people who are laughing and happy.�\n- Ayn Rand\n\nand she follows with this... :D\n\n�I am not the means to any end others may wish to accomplish. I am not a tool for their use. I am not a servant of their needs. I am not a bandage for their wounds, I am not a sacrifice on their altars.�\n- Ayn Rand \n\nSomething seems to be fucked up there, NO ? :D",
