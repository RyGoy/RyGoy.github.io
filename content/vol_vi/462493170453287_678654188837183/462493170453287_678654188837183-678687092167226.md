   "message": "\"Notice how they�ll accept anything except a man who stands alone. They recognize him at once . . . . There�s a special, insidious kind of hatred for him. They forgive criminals. They admire dictators. Crime and violence are a tie. A form of mutual dependence. They need ties. They�ve got to force their miserable little personalities on every single person they meet. The independent man kills them�because they don�t exist within him and that�s the only form of existence they know. Notice the malignant kind of resentment against any idea that propounds independence. Notice the malice toward an independent man.\"",
