   "message": "Michael A Rivera, I've never seen a birth certificate with a bar code on it. My BC has my mothers signature on it, along with a lot of other information, but no bar code.  The bonded birth certificates I have are called, \"long copy\".  What is the name of your birth certificate that contains a bar code with an easily identified bond number?  Thank you!!!!",
