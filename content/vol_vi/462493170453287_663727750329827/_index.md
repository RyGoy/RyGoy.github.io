   "message": "OMG.....I am truly in shock.....so I posted my speeding ticket a couple weeks ago which I sent back Refused for Cause, Without Dishonor, Without Recourse, Non Assumpsit.  Remember, I was coming down a hill and only sped up for a about 3 seconds over the speed limit. I got the letter from the Courthouse today and the amount of the ticket is $1,266.00.....are they f**king crazy???? I see this cop writing these tickets every morning in the same spot....I am now guessing this is a trap and they are incahoots with the Courthouse...",
