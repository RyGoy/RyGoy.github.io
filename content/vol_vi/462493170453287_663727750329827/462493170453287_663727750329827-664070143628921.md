   "message": "I have done the Notice Process with parking tickets, Notice of Conditional Acceptance, Notice of Mistake, Notice of Default Judgment that I learned in the Sui Juris Self Governing Group, however I have not used it for a moving violation....this  ticket I did sign V.C. Under Duress and Coercion...I refused my ID and the cop was going to arrest me so I complied...so I am now wondering if that has anything to do with the cost of the ticket....its almost $1300 and he said I was going 12 miles over the speed limit....I haven't had a ticket in a very long time but I cannot imagine they cost this much.....The Notice of Mistake in this group is very different than the Notice of Mistake I learned in Sui Juris.",
