   "message": "If you want to practice \"administrating\" then asking for a bill would be a good exercise with these psychopaths. If you want to have fun and solidify your understanding of who you are with these psychopaths, then a Notice of Mistake is in order. I see that you can have 2 choices with them. If you get tired with them for giving you the run around with administrating, stop everything you are doing and throw the NOM at them. Like I said, have some fun.",
