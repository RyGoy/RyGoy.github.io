   "message": "Similarly, the removal of the text regarding \"Alexander's claims\" causes the reader of the \"reissued Magna Carta\" to not have access to that bit of vital information and therefore cannot learn the LIE created by OMISSION, leaving them to depend on that belief without any counter argument.\n\nI used to see these type deceptions in my profession as a Sales & Marketing Designer/Coordinator.
