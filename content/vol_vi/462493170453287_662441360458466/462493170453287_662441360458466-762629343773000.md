NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT!\n\nShit like \" Not sure why you feel the need to deconstruct everything I say and debate semantics. I just use the words I'm comfortable with.\" WILL GET YOU FUCKING BANNED!\n\nNOW, I want someone BESIDES me to explain why this is the case, so when the stupid whiner gets all butt-hurt and whining to everyone else about my \"arrogance\" and my \"ego\", you can counter by pointing them to THIS post, and show it's not true.\n\nGO!",
