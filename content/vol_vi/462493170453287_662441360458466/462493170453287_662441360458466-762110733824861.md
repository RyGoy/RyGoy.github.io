   "message": "\"  \nIn all the wars with England, no other Scottish king ever came so\nfar.\nIt was an incredible achievement.\nAlexander's head must have swelled with every passing day.\nHe was 17\nand he was on the brink of achieving his family's longest-held\nambition.\nHalf of Britain was nearly his.\nBut then fate dealt a devastating blow.\nKing John died.\nOn the face of it, his death should have been good news for\nAlexander,\nbut with John out of the way, the need for the barons' war vanished.\nThe barons who had once opposed King John now flocked to his son's\nside -\nthe new king, Henry III.\nBoth Alexander, King of Scots,\nand Louis, the French prince, had outgrown their usefulness.\nThe English barons sent them packing.\nThere was no deal for Alexander - all of his grand ambitions fizzled\nout.\nHenry III reissued Magna Carta\nand all references to Alexander's claims were omitted -\nnot even a footnote.\nDespite loud protests, the ground was cut from beneath his feet\nand he was left out in the cold.\nAnd it got worse. The Pope gave his backing to Henry III.\nAlexander found himself excommunicated...\n... the powers of the Scottish church suspended.\nBack to square one.\n\"\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=yzk7AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT75&lpg=PT75&dq=%22To+do+right+by+Alexander%22+MAGNA+CARTA&source=bl&ots=fKLsYxyOG8&sig=yrvftfiWCdms5Ad5Yiri7OxAxIQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4BOTVNjMEsjUoATE8YDoAQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22To%20do%20right%20by%20Alexander%22%20MAGNA%20CARTA&f=false",
