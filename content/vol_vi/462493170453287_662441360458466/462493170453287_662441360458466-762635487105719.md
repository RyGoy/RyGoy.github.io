   "message": "If one is in this group, one is only here for the sole purpose of advancing Admiral Scott's agenda. Anything that one \"gets\" here in terms of knowledge, and/or anything else, it's just a by product of the Admiral's agenda. \n\nThe number 1 rule is: Scott is ALWAYS  RIGHT! Admiral Scott in the one that holds/has the knowledge. In more than 2 years that this group has existed, the Admiral has PROVEN over, and over, that this is a FACT. Nobody has been able to challenge his knowledge.\n\nAnyone that comes to the group has nothing new to show to the Admiral. If one is here, one is most likely a programmed sack of shit. He is not interested in \"our opinions.\" So to anyone new, and/or old here, unless is a question regarding the matters taught here, one is better staying quiet.\n\nAll he asks is for us to shut the fuck-up, read, and learn. Then make questions, and then, if one knows what one is talking about,  participate by adding input, if needed.",
