   "message": "No its the way I did it and it works, when you ask for Registered Mail you will notice the Post Office will try to sell you certified mail instead. Funny how would they prefer selling you something cheaper when registered mail makes them more money. I was a mailman for 20 years. When you ask for it they will ask you to put a value on it and for the value to have weight it must be more than $20. Hence I used 21. No im not pulling nothing out of my ass, im just sharing and helping out. I have had great outcome with I did. I wasnt going against no tickets or bullshit fines. It was criminal charges and I was already in jail so they had me already as SURETY but the law must accept mistakes.  Notice of Mistake.",
