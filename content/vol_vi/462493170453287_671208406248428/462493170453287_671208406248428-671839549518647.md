   "message": "'They want to have a meaningful and trusted relationship with the police because they know their neighbourhoods will not be safe without it.'\n\nSounds like a false premise...the whole tone of this suggests that if they wanna screw you, they're going to screw you...just some harder than others, because unless you get screwed, the neighbourhoods wont be safe...to follow that logic, they are professing that neighbourhoods wouldn't be safe without priests n paedophiles....oh wait :/",
