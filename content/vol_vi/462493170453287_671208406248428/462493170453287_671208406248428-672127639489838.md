   "message": "Garbage men, like farmers, carpenters and cooks, are not professionals. There is no need to speak or profess anything to do those jobs. They do not have to sell their view of reality or convince others of a need for their services for others to openly accept what they have to offer. Policy enforcers are not openly accepted which is, I would think, the genesis of the need for your 'National Kick a Cop in the face Day'.",
