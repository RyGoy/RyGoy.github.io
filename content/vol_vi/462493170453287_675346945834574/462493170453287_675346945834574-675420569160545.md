   "message": "<<The BIBLE is a book of commerce, from what I now understand. It is put forth to most as a reflection of what it really is. >> Is this you, Beverly, or quoting someone else? :/\n\nI take it as an offence now when anyone within this group tries to even imply the \"bible\" has anything to teach at all, and/or has any \"truth\" concerning reality. There is no answers in a made-up book, written by appointment by an evil pseudo-culture centuries ago, with the purpose of ENSLAVING US. \n\nI am confused by this post. I am not clear when is Beverly Berta Braakschmack saying something, or quoting someone at times.\n\nBeverly, I ask you: do you feel with the authority/author to interpret anything from that fantasy book you happened to NOT write? So, we should help \"lost\" religious people by telling them that they are looking at the \"bible\" the \"wrong way,\" for they should see it as a \"commerce handbook\" instead? We should recommend others to read the \"bible,\" and look for commercial \"clues\"? Do you believe there is ANY \"truth\" in the \"bible\" at all?\n\nI think the best thing to say to anyone that believes in ANYTHING the bible says is: the truth!  That it is 100% bullshit from start to finish, and must throw it away, or burn it.  Then, one must condemn the \"bible\", and any other magical books.\n\n And fuck this! <<Proverbs 25:2  It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.>>",
