   "message": "What is the INTENT and PURPOSE of Blake quoting the bible? Why did he posted that bible verse? He is a coward, as all Christians. He is afraid to directly say what he thinks, and uses stupid bible verses to cover the fact that he is in fact a coward.\n\nThis is what   Blake Gardner  FULLY intended to communicate: that we should tame our tongues, because tongues are evil, and poisonous! Because Yahweh get's pissed!\n\n<<James 3\n\nTaming the Tongue\n\n3 Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. 2 We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check.\n\n3 When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. 4 Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. 5 Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. 6 The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one�s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.\n\n7 All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind, 8 but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.\n\n9 With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings, who have been made in God�s likeness. 10 Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this should not be. 11 Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring? 12 My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.>>\n\nI call you out on this one, Blake. What is the INTENT, and PURPOSE of posting that bible verse?",
