   "message": "Just finished reading Kenneth Paul's bullshit. I'm sure there are a bunch of \"quiet\" christians who think we're really bad for not \"accepting his beliefs\" and being \"tolerant\" of them.\n\nSomeone explain why I must tolerate delusion. Why do you delusional fuckwits think your delusion has the same standing as my knowledge?\n\nALL BELIEF IS EVIL. ALL OF IT. If you BELIEVE something that happens to be true, then you can be sure you GOT that belief serving someone else's agenda.",
