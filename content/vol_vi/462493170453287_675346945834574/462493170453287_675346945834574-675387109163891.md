   "message": "I don't believe we were put here for any reason or as a representative of any higher being...we created God when the stars were falling from the sky, or when the weather wouldn't cooperate and there were droughts or too much rain...we made sacrifices to appease the Gods...maybe that volcano wouldn't erupt if we cut the heart out of one more virgin, or threw one in the caldera...is that that same God we are trying to \"represent\"? I BELIEVE we are here thanks to evolution....why we need to find purpose in our lives in the name of some pyramid scheme is beyond me. Why is it that we can't be grateful and appreciative of the life and the earth we have inherited from our ancestors? Why not make the best of the world and life we have been born into...try to improve it if we can and die knowing that we brought no intentional harm to anything while we were here. I guess reality just isn't good enough, so we need to have a spin...to make life worth living. Well I believe in two things...a beginning and an end. I will try to make the best of the stuff between; and I, personally, don't need a God to point me in the \"right\" direction.",
