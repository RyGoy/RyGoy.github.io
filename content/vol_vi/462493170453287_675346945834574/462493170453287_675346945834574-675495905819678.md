You've already submitted, fully, to an invisible \"authority\" who presents you with ZERO evidence of any right to rule you. You accept this all as being true, based on words written by men.\n\nIs it really that hard to see the parallels there? We've been submitting to the government, a, for all intents and purposes, \"invisible authority\", whose only evidence of their \"right to rule us\" is based on words...written by men...\n\nDo I really need to make that any clearer?\"",
