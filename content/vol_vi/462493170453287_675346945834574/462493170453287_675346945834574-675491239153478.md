   "message": "No, you see, we DON'T believe. If you've done any reading through this group, you must have seen the often-repeated \"Scottism\" stating that \"ALL BELIEF IS EVIL\". And this applies to more than just religion. If you \"Believe\" something, it means you have accepted it as being true, with no evidence to back the claim up. It means you've swallowed this line, whichever line it is, on faith and you have stopped thinking about it. No further investigation occurs.",
