   "message": "Ok well I am putting it out here.\n\nThe BIBLE is a book of commerce, from what I now understand. It is put forth to most as a reflection of what it really is. Those who follow the bible really have absolutely NO FUCKING IDEA what it means unless some �minister� tells them what it means. Because who could really read that thing and have a clue what any of that shit means other than it is a FICTION book. \n\nBut when some guy tells you �this is what it means� and �this is how you should live TO BE HAPPY�... everyone goes with that. Yet that same �guy� diddled your son you find out later... but let�s ignore that...\n\n... Yes, the only way to be happy is to listen to that guy. \n\nHere�s an example of what someone I care about who has been brought up very religiously sent me after sending them my �NOT MINE� booklet:\n\n\"Romans 13:6-8\n6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God�s servants (so now figure out who is �god�, huh?), who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.\"\n\nSo �god� must be a bank then, correct? Oh, but that �minister� forgot to tell you HOW TO PAY. RESPECT=Accept. FOR HONOUR=Accept for Honor, or Supra Protest. It is described in the �Bills of Exchange�. Who�d have thunk?\n\nAnd here, I acronym: FFS! It is easy to see once you ACCEPT THE TRUTH OF IT ALL.\n\nand more...\n\n\"Romans 13: 5,6\n\n5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.\"\n\nYes! They created this shitty MONEY OF DEBT... and you are going to either figure out how it works, with another delusion of shitty public school system (which would be impossible), or by yourself (otherwise known as basically impossible)... and your left with...\n\noh right. Warehouse... for your benefit? \n\nHere�s the rest of that response:\n\n�Does this make any sense? Rules are meant to be followed? Yes? - It creates harmony and respect each other. Please work on paying your utility billings - I would not want them to put a lien on your property that you live in and have paid into for so long.  \n\n-Also everyone is out there earning a living, paying taxes, paying bills - are you thinking our govt will pay our way? just because we are its property? It is merely a way of tracking our existence and making sure we \"pay our own way for the privilege of living here.\" The bigger question is - Would we get that opportunity else where in this world? On another note though - I always admired your strength of always giving 100% of yourself when it came to learning something or figuring out how to do something - Always training yourself how to do things that are crazy difficult for most but you dive in and research or keep pushing yourself to find out how to make it work (web designing, renovating and earning your interior design certification, just to name a few) With that in mind - I think your disappointment  in our govt run country should be taken with a different approach - Politics!! LOL better to understand from this inside!!�\n\n...wow\n\nSo, does anyone see how this �bible�, by way of its �teachers/ministers� has misconstrued what is going on?\n\nOn that note, can we not \"bounce\" bible thumpers so quickly and maybe show them their delusion? Like the last fella so recently bounced. :(",
