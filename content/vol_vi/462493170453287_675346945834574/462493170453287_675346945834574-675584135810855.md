   "message": "It's not a matter of bashing others, look deeper than that. Theists base their entire lives around belief in some supreme authority, with no \"evidence\" other than a piece of paper that tells them that they have to. This mirrors our government/legal system. \n\nIf you can be fooled by one, you can be fooled by the other. Attempting to escape from one is futile, that flaw in your thought process will always allow you to be ensnared again by the next piece of paper that sounds good.",
