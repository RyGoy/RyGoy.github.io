   "message": "Kenneth Paul, YOU came here. You requested to join this group. Scott added you by your own submission. \n\nWas it a \"Calling\" from \"god\" that made you join this group? Did not \"god\" warned you in advance, via \"prayers,\" not to join this group if you were an intolerant adult with imaginary friends?  \n\nThis group is anti-DELUSIONS in general, not just YOUR delusions, Kenneth. If this offends your imaginary sky-daddy, please leave now. Neither us, nor you have anything to offer here, then.",
