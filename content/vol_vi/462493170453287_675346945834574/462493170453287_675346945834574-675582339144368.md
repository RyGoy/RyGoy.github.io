How you choose to interpret the respective fiction you're dealing with at the moment is YOUR choice or decision. \nAll bibles, courts, laws, authority, money, governments; heck even the English and most other languages. All fiction. No?\nWho gives a flying fuck anyway?\n\nThis post seems to have opened some kind of can O worms [that one was for you Adam], why is that so?\nDid it offend a belief/worldview you have? Did it offend your superiority complex? What's your boggle? Better yet, what's your agenda?\n\nMaybe some people [including myself] should start looking at themselves rather than waste energy bashing others who might not favor the same \"fictions\" they do; that might be more productive.\nWhat makes your \"fiction\" better than the one of someone else?\n\nJust an observation...[and more can O worms...]  \n;)",
