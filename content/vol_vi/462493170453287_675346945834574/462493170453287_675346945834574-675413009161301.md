   "message": "Oh I know Beverly, we created the money when barter and trade weren't good enough...we need commerce...so we have put a number on the the side of a pig to give us a set price...we make it up as we go along...I will never argue with you there...and money based on gold???...yet when the shit hits the fan the gold and barter/trade will be worth something still...the money will be worth what we will continue to BELIEVE it is worth until people wake up and see that it isn't really worth the paper (plastic) it is written on. But the bottom line is that we don't factor in the externalities...so it will always be a economically fictitious world in which we live. But as long as we have religion...we will have war...we will have a growing economy based on our imaginary resources...in our imaginary world that we have created. Makes me shake my head and say WTF  PAF.",
