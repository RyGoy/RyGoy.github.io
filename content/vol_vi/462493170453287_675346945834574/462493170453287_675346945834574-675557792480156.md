   "message": "Well, Kenneth Paul? Let's hear your rebuttal to my oh-so-very valid points.\n\n-Your acceptance of the concept of a \"god\" is what leaves you open to victimization by the government. If you do not remove that first, you will ALWAYS be tripped up by faith in something. Belief in one lie means you can be talked into swallowing pretty much any other lie.\n\n-You're basing your entire life around something which not only has NO evidence to corroborate it, but a MOUNTAIN of evidence that disproves it. See how that's a problem? Accepting someone's word that something is true without any proof to back it up. Gee, kind of sounds like our current legal system, doesn't it?\n\n-Even bigger tip to newbies: Ditch the \"god delusion\" upon entering, or you're never going to have even a snowball's chance in \"Hell\" of escaping the government's control. You've already submitted, fully, to an invisible \"authority\" who presents you with ZERO evidence of any right to rule you. You accept this all as being true, based on words written by men.\n\n- Is it really that hard to see the parallels there? We've been submitting to the government �a, for all intents and purposes, \"invisible authority\"� whose only evidence of their \"right to rule us\" is based on words...written by men...\nDo I really need to make that any clearer?\n\n-\"The Bible is true because the Bible says so!\"\n\n-\"You must follow this law because this law says so!\"\n\nAny fucking questions?!",
