   "message": "\"Assignment\" is just a technical word for TRANSFER, Gail. So you do that, now, the Minister of Finance has the BC you sent him, knowing YOU signed it, knowing YOU are the SURETY for it. One does not actually have to sign the back of a cheque they take to the bank for whatever reason. The ENDORSEMENT, in that case, is completed simply by DELIVERY. The definition is even in the Bills of Exchange Act, and a teller even admitted that to me though she told me- \"dont tell anyone i told you that\"",
