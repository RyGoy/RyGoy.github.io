   "message": "There is a trustee corporation with some completed bills of exchange and receipts that need to be taken care of to ensure the accounts balance. I've been focusing on figuring out the process for the trustee corp to follow in sending them to the bank of canada. So far this is what I've suggested to the trustee corp;\n\n1. send public notice and copy of birth certificate to the bank of canada and minister of finance \n2. confirm that the minister of finance fiduciary/trustee\n3. send the completed bill of exchange or receipt to the bank of canada and a copy to the minister of finance. (in cases where there is more then one, sent an itemized statement with bills receipts attached?)\n\nIt seems to me that we want to create an account of sorts so that weekly/monthly whatever we choose, the process will be simple once all is set up. Anyone have any suggestions or insights on what else we need to consider?",
