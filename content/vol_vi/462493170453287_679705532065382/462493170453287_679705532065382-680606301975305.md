   "message": "Ok, just finished like raping this thread...I just wonder how the concept 'lose the name, win the game' works:\n\nI have seen that scenario play out many times with roadside encounters...and in the majority of cases it ends badly (see, the majority is always wrong).\n\nThe presumption at ALL levels is that YOU are the name...YOU are still in the game, UNTIL you establish your role and remove the presumption(s):\n\nBy acting as:\nSole Authorised Administrator.\n\nBy having the name liened into a private trust, removing the name from the government jurisdiction...and then RESIGNING as a government agent.\n\nThat looks to me like 'secure the name, win the game'.\n\nTo dumb down the 'lose the name, win the game' concept to the ridiculous (it's the only way my bullshit detector works....I haven't yet graduated to the 2.0 version that Pete Daoust, Chris Evan & Mackximus Minimus use)\n\nI am a man, with a hat (person)....I'm not the hat.\n\nLose the hat, get a burnt head....makes no sense :/\n\nMaybe a new catchcry will help the 13000+ followers Ross has:\n\n'Learn how to use the name/secure the name, win the game'...not as catchy, the marketers will hate it, but at least it is accurate :P",
