   "message": "NOTHING of Interest here, Folks. Move on....  ;)\n\n< The impending trial of President Uhuru Kenyatta and the trial of Deputy President William Ruto, \"whose cases were initiated proprio motu\" by then-ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo in 2010, have only served to further sour relations between the two institutions.\n\nSome African leaders are now claiming that the \"Rome Statute\" violates their sovereignty and have issued accusations that rather than pursuing cases on the basis of universal demands, the ICC and the UNSC are doing so on the basis of political expediency. >\n\nWith near on DOUBLE the population of AUSTRALIA, I wonder how many of the Kenyan people know of the \"law\" that their President and Deputy President are to now be held accountable by?\n\nI'm guessing it would be more than the number of people in AUSTRALIA there are - knowing of what is,  the Law?\n\nHow to get out of paying fines, rego, fees and tolls?\n\nLEARN of and USE, the Law? It's that simple, Folks!\n\nGoogle: http://tiny.cc/j4lbhx\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/211871612287035/",
