They just dont know the govt doesnt give a fuck about them...\n\nThey are dependent because they are ignorant.\nThey don't know who they are and WHAT they are not.\nThose are simple facts and they can be proven by any man/woman who can ask questions.\n\nForget the \"dead corporate fiction name\" lingo...
