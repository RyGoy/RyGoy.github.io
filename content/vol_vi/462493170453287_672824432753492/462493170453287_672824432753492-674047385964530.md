   "message": "2014 05 28 � Dean Clifford � update number 11\n\nThese notes were taken from the update with the best of my ability, E&OE, Errors and Omissions Expected:\n� PPSA commercial liens are being put or soon going to be put on several property titles which includes RCMP stations and courthouses.\n� Each one of these have been put on something called a collateral schedule amongst other things.\n� Regarding Dean�s trust account, he has served the government and bank of Canada and AG proper notice that they will no longer be their bank on his behalf and Dean is going to act as his own Bank which he will probably explain to everyone more in detail when he gets out.\n� Transcripts have been ordered, especially the bail hearing that was on around March 25th and the motions that were heard last week. Appeals have been filed also which should be heard next week.\n� In the appeals court, Dean�s common law rights can be heard and acknowledged which will be much harder for them to f*#k him over.\n� Got the names of every judge from day one which will be added as debtors to the claims, PPSA�s and commercial liens that are about to be filed.\n� As soon as the PPSA�s have been submitted and processed, the output will be attached to commercial liens that are being prepared.\n� This will be severed on the bar association, the lawyers, the courts, on the bank of Canada, everybody is getting f*#king lien�ed.\n� Someone new has been brought into the fold to assist Dean with writing documents and preparing filings as well as Dean now having access to a computer.",
