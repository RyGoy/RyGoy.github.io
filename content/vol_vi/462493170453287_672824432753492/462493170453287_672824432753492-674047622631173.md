   "message": "� Where agents from the Crown attorney�s office are grilling them for information and giving them grief over the phone.\n� At least 2 Notaries have affirmed that agents from the Crown attorney�s office have �advised� in an intimidating fashion that they should probably stop notarising Dean�s documents. Both Notaries have told them to f*#k off.\n� A law suit was attempted to be served last week at the Crown attorney�s office that entailed obstruction of justice and intimidation but the names of these agents couldn�t be ascertained but the women at the desk flipped out and then refused service.\n� Recommendations were relayed of what David Lindsay said the list of charges shouldn�t be too long, keeping them down, Dean pointed out the same charge can be grouped into counts.\n� Dean said he is perusing both civil and criminal charges against HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN.\n� It is the duty of Queens Bench civil court to convert any elements from any civil claim into corresponding criminal charges and order the prosecution of them which there is case law on this according to Dean�s friend Allen.\n� Dean is uncertain about the form of laying out these charges though, so he is just using a standard QB criminal application same way he was doing to have his charges discharged.\n� The biggest mistake he has made so far is that he already had made an application for a warrant to arrest all those who have committed crimes against him, he actually stood down on those matters because he only wanted to address the discharging of the federal criminal charges and his release that day. The minute he did that, he removed any standing he had in the court for taking out his claim of injury.\n� Dean says now he has standing in Queens Bench going forward.\n� There was an instance where a hearing Dean was ready with everything in check and instead they patched him through from Brandon CC via video linkup where essentially they wouldn�t let him speak at all. This was in provincial court they did this to him.\n� Turns out they were talking over him and even in the room he was patched through on. He ended up telling whom was talking over him while he was trying to read out onto the record an affidavit they refused to accept.\n� The judge also kept interrupting him trying to deny him from speaking at all. Dean�s response was �Excuse me, Servant! Keep your mouth shut while I�m reading. I�m speaking, I�m the master here and you�re the servant and you be quiet while I am talking, Do you understand?� in response, the judge said, �Well well� I�m the administrator here.� And Dean replied �I don�t give a f*#king sh^t because I�m the executor and I outrank you. Keep your mouth shut!!!�",
