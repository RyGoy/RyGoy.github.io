   "message": "Wouldn't go that far. Scott is also another strong soul who professes to have the answers we need if we want to fight back. Scott claims that he is always right, which makes him no different than Croft, Clifford, or Menard in that respect. I am not saying Scott is wrong though. Time will reveal the true effectiveness of the knowledge he has and how it can be applied. If it turns out Scott *is* always right, then I will look back on these times in my life and be thankful I was a member of The Tender for Law :)",
