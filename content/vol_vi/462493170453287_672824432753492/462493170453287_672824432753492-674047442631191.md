   "message": "� More has been done over 10 days that has been done over 6 months, things are moving forward nicely.\n� But more help is still needed as there isn�t enough people to get everything done that needs to be in order to execute the coming barrage that is planned.\n� Dean�s situation with his closed/frozen bank accounts are being sorted out and authority is being handed over to sign and manage that for him which should alleviated some stresses and inconveniences in terms of paying bills and getting things done.\n� Dean�s new helper friend could do with laptop and internet switched back on at his home so things can get done.\n� Pertinent documents are making their way to the proper parties that are integral to Dean�s future claims which he hasn�t been able to access for a while now. It wasn�t wise to send the originals after a new quality microphone and audio box for Darren being returned to sender last week and at the powers that be intercepting them.\n� Copies are or to be certified.\n� There was also documents that identify the titles for the legislative building in which Dean plans to lien the f*#k out of also. So much prior research and homework has been done well before him being taken.\n� Brandon Correctional Centre is also owned by HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN just to let you know.\n� The court buildings, all 5 titles, are also owned by HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN.\n� The Winnipeg city police station and public safety building are also owned by HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN.\n� �she� is the debtor in all of these claims. Dean thinks the best way to go after her bonding is to go after the legal entity HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN as represented by, some may disagree.",
