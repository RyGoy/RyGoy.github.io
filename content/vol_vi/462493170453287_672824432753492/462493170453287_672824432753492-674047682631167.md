   "message": "� Witnesses in the court room, friends and family of Dean�s were there which Dean was patched through and they saw them all scrambling trying to cut the audio from the feed from Brandon CC. It was f*#king hilarious where a bunch of dumb c*nts were running around saying �How we turn it off, how we turn it off�. All while Dean was reading out some rather profound stuff.\n�  It took them like 5 minutes to turn the audio off, so it will be good to know if anything of what Dean said made it onto the transcripts.\n� Supposably there was like 12 sheriffs in the provincial court room waiting all day for Dean�s hearing in this instance where wasn�t even in the room and it started at like 4pm.\n� The judge claimed he didn�t understand anything at all but would not specify exactly what in which Dean was happy to clarify. It was obvious the judge didn�t want to understand even if he could or wanted to.\n� This was because in a lower statutory court, the judge could not hear his common law arguments.\n� It is expected Dean may get out next Thursday at the applet level court. So a bail review at a upper level at QB will be heard next week so might have some good news them.\n� Others have gotten out at appeals court where it was mentioned that the issue of financing and damages for being in jail all the time. It seems a question they do not want to answer.\n� Upon Dean�s release, all the PPSA�s will be in place, and the courts, judges, cps attorney�s, rcmp officers, jp, ought to be served and commercial liens in place against them ready to go.\n� He hopes to already have the bonds frozen for the crowns, at that point they ought to be a whole lot less excited to go after him any further at that point.\n� At another hearing that happened recently where the judge wanted to speak to Dean after a hearing, but the sheriffs disobeyed that order in QB. They wouldn�t even allow Dean to file any paperwork himself also. Turns out, the same sheriff that roughhoused Dean pulling him to the van, was directly sitting behind a friend / witness in the court recently started poking her quite hard in the back quit hard telling her to �GET UP, GET UP� when the judge was asking everyone to rise. Such an action would provoke a verbose reaction in anyone, but knowing what circumstances one was under and the importance of being there, the ideal response was refrained from. Dean has declared �that f*#ker is going down� and saying this sheriff just assaulted her. Which brings to question, are these sheriff�s actual lawfully appointed sheriffs or are they just nothing more than mall cops with an extra shiny talisman and a gun? Something to research into there. Maybe Dean can go put criminal charges on him and lien his house. Might make things difficult with his bank when this sheriff can�t afford the mortgage repayments after losing his job. Might be a good process against agents such as this one to template.\n� Anyone going to the next hearing needs to get his badge number and his photo if they can.\n�  In all the transcripts in the provincial court, even though the lower statutory courts cannot hear common law arguments, things later on can be taken to higher court of inherit jurisdiction and have those convictions over turned in a heartbeat.\n� The moment you deny to be the trustee in these lower magistrate statutory kangaroo courts, the card they always play is that �Well Mr. Such�n�Such, I�m issuing a warrant for him�.\n� Dean says he would announce himself as the man but not one that acts a class of person that has rights and duties conferred by HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN and is not a subject thereof and is not a trustee or anything else within her ranks.\n� Being coursed and subdued into submission can be taken as under duress and deal with the damages later on can be a good angle to take things on.\n� It would be good to get the Pdf of the David�s book to get to Dean, he has a computer in Brandon CC now.\n� We will need to do a fundraiser soon to help those who are helping which one girl spent $1500 of her own money on filings, transcripts, getting copies of titles, driving around and time spent not working due to this.\n� Collect call bill to Darren, Dean�s brother was $1200\n� Dean�s construction business has completely gone under as a result of this.\n� More exclusive updates and Q&A�s are going to be released on the forum going forward this week.",
