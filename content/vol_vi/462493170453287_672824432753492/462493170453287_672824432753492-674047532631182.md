   "message": "� Dean is looking to refer to some other sample filings to compare to his drafts to perfect his form with his approach to things before they are executed.\n�  Darren, Dean�s brother has been speaking to Kevin Annett about a few things in regards to recent happenings with his actions against HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN and the CROWN CORPORATION in regards to crimes against sovereign inhabitants that have been exposed.\n� Dean and Kevin hope to compare notes and documents over the coming weeks.\n� In a documents / notices that were severed on the register and vital statistics, he notify them when he goes after the Bank of Canada, he will not be relying on the court of Queen�s Bench Supreme Court, It is his will and intend to convene a Grand Jury and find 24 sovereign people of this land and have them appoint a judge of their choosing and we will be holding a common law court and will be convicting HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN.\n� 24 man Grand Jury is the highest form of law that there is on this planet.\n� If they do not give everything back and compensate Dean there is a 24 manned Grand Jury that is going to get convened.\n� Be good to clarify if the appointed judge makes the 24th or not as many say there are 23 in a Grand Jury or maybe that is the governments was to mislead people and 24 actually need to form a real Grand Jury are needed.\n� And many figure heads are welcomed to be involved from all over. This can be made as an example, organised, template and executed at places all over the world HER MAJESTY has her teeth into.\n� Grand jury investigations are secret, and evidence isn�t made public until there is an indictment.\n� It is suspected that the powers that be are planning a false flag event. So trends in the news indicate an IMMENIENT FALSE FLAG EVENT could very well be on the cards.\n� In the mainstream news, a rifileshooting range has been broken into twice and the RCMP is now being trained in case of a shootout with training videos on what to do. This indicates that they are preparing the public that there is an event going to happen.\n� Dean hopes someone is going to be doing a radio show about that so it can be called in advance.\n� They had to go to the extent to pulling the plug on this one which was so predictable.\n� Dean thinks they intentionally did video so they could make the audio disappear, similar to what they did with his nabbing February 2013 last year with the tussle with the cop in the parking lot who lost the plot.\n� There was a property secured last year that was planned for the first instalment of the land stewardship project out in British Colombia. A down payment was made from the funds raised from the seminar but things took a turn since Dean hasn�t been able to work and his situation has made him into the posterboy for the FREEMAN movement. FREEMAN being a term made up by the Government made up to pigeonhole people who just want to learn the law, enforce their rights and who are sick of being raped, oppressed and taken advantage of by their servants.\n� Fortunately, the next instalment that was due has been extended. Plans should be written and disclosed soon on this.\n� In response to some important documents being filed in the courts, the Notaries� officers are being harassed from the Crown attorney�s office in Winnipeg.",
