   "message": "Posted by Admin on May 29, 2014 in News |\nIt was requested the update had to be taken down because someones name was mentioned who didn�t want to be named.\nDespite combing though the audio all day editing out this certain name I was it was still mentioned, so I�m led to believe.\nThis job is too difficult and people are too demanding yet always ungrateful only to be wanting more, so from here on, don�t expect any more updates for some time.\nI will confirm this morning if the name was mentioned or not, if it wasn�t then I will be calling bullshit on much as there are clearly agendas at play here.\nIf I am at fault, then well sorry for that, Dean does talk at a million miles an hour and it is very hard combing through and cutting out first names all Fucking day.\nEither way, this will be the last update for some time till Dean gets out and sorts out his life etc.:",
