   "message": "Sue, you missed how Dean was able to convince people like myself that he was absolutely right over the course of a couple of years and gain a huge following. I almost ended up in prison for believing in his methods and testing them out, along with those of Mary Elizabeth Croft. If you haven't followed Dean, you wouldn't care what he does. Same thing goes with Scott. If you don't follow him, you don't care what he does.",
