   "message": "My mother was a minister she cheated on my father with and eventually married a preacher. He was physically and verbally abusive (kept me from school regularly in fear of repercussions from the school because of my injuries, days even weeks at a time) because, well, god.... He hated/hates me because since I was a young child I questioned his BELIEFS and mocked his sermons. :-)\nI once openly berated him during a church service he was preaching. ;-) If I learned anything from being victimized by a cultist and my own mother because, well, god. It would be that these people that claim they have a relationship with an imaginary being are dangerous to people in general but mostly their own family members. I always knew I was smarter than THEM!!!",
