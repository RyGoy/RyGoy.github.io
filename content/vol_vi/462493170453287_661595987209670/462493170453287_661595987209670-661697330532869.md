   "message": "Priests, reverends, and Pastors, are weapons-free targets to ALL Aquilae Officers and crew. This means they can hurt or even kill a priest/reverend/pastor and I will personally see to it that they evade capture, and moved to an inaccessible area. This is a matter of public record and we do not hide our violent intent against these types.\n\n...I just thought this would be a good time to REMIND all the Pastors/Reverends/Priests, who may be reading, that if they ever see the Trust seal in their travels, they should run...especially if it's a female wearing said seal; You will likely be hurt, and/or possibly killed...\n\n...and after you have exhausted yourself running, they will likely hunt you and beat your exhausted carcass to jelly with steel bars. \n\nUnless you are prepared to go to your \"flock\" and admit the fraud you pulled on them...\n\n...yeah, you will likely be beaten to death by girls.",
