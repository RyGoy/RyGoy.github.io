   "message": "\"I used to abuse children with threats of eternal torture, but I gave that up six years ago\".\n\nJason Lerato surely thinks that I am \"being mean\" and has rationalized in his head that it's ok because he \"Stopped\" being a fraud artist and child abuser. That's the worst part... these kind think that the \"prodigal son\" thing is a \"good\" thing when in reality, it's social engineering to compensate for the failings of others..\n\n...except most \"others\" are also adults with imaginary friends. It's why ignorance is celebrated these days.",
