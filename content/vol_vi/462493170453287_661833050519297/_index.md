   "message": "This was written by a friend of a friend and so I share it with you. Maybe you can find some remedy in this communication for yourself or someone you know.\nPlease share it as you will, perhaps an eye or two can be opened. I've removed personal contact information in order to protect the presumed guilty...   :)\n\nLast time I checked, google was still functional, so stop watching TV and start looking into what's really going on in those shit holes called court houses...\n\nTo: XXXXXXXXX@XXXXXXXX\nSubject: EXPOSE THE FRAUD\n \nPUBLIC INQUIRY DEMANDED INTO TRAFFIC COURT FRAUD \n\n        I wish  to express my concerns over the situation in the Provincial Court (Traffic). I do some work as a Paralegal and a Provincial Court Agent, helping people with Traffic Tickets among other things, I also operate what I call the Legal Help Society as part of my service. The recent articles  in the Edmonton Sun regarding; �The Tough Road Ahead�by Rick Bell, in the Edmonton Journal regarding the �Photo Radar Cash Cow� by Dave Staples, in the Edmonton Sun \"Denial of Justice\" (Apr. 1, 2014) by Kevin Martin and CTV News article by Sarah Richter, \"Province looking to take traffic infractions out of the Provincial Court\", caused me to contact you . \n\n       I believe the people involved in the Traffic Ticket Agent Industry are partly responsible for some of these articles, I am not among them and I do not really subscribe to their views. They appear to have also gotten the Edmonton Criminal Trial Lawyers Assoc. and their Calgary counterparts to issue statements to the media concerning \"The Erosion of Civil Rights\", if the accused in a Traffic Ticket Matter cannot confront their accuser, (the cop who issued the ticket) in a so called�Court of Law�. If they think that by confronting a cop, in a so called Court of Law will get them any justice or preserve their civil rights, they are sadly Mistaken and Delusional. \n\n         I Do Not Say What I Am About To Say Lightly, my  experience  has been, that it �JUST DOESN�T MATTER� if you face your accuser or not. The Provincial Court (Traffic) system is so RIGGED and so FRAUDULENT, and on so Many Different Levels, that its very Difficult if not Impossible, to get your head around all the different frauds involved, just so you can defend yourself properly. Because of this �SYSTEMIC FRAUD� it's very difficult to win your case at any time, if at all.\n\n       Without going into too many legal details,  I believe, that the �Fundamental Issue� is that the Provincial Court(Traffic) OPERATES ILLEGALLY, I will explain. The Provincial Court of Alberta (Traffic) and the so called crown prosecutors who bring these �fraudulent quasi-criminal�(a very important legal concept) traffic charges forward, and  who run the trials, and who seem to �Control and Operate This Court For Their Own Benefit�, fall under the mandate of the Provincial Minister of Justice(J. Denis).  However  the �Traffic Safety Act�(The Act) under which people are prosecuted (persecuted), falls under the mandate of the Minister of Transportation (W. Drysdale). Pursuant to sec. 22 of the Act, the Minister has the �Alberta Transportation and Safety Board�(the Board) administer the Act on his behalf. Starting at sec. 27 of the Act,  the Alberta Transportation and Safety Board is vested with �All The Powers� of the Court of Queen's Bench for the trials of civil actions, which allows the Board to become a Superior Court in it's own right, just like the Court of Queen's Bench, (almost). The Board has the Right to Hold Hearings, Reviews and Appeals as to ANY MATTER coming before it under the TRAFFIC SAFETY ACT, which is �Administrative Law�, and not a law of �General Application�(which would apply to everybody). Any decision of the Board �CAN ONLY BE REVIEWED� by a Court of Superior Jurisdiction ( i.e. the Court of Queen's Bench, the Court of Appeal of Alberta, The Supreme Court of Canada), and only on �ONE  ISSUE� pursuant to sec. 47.1 (1), (2),  (3) of the Act, that being of \"PATENT UNREASONABLENESS\". My question is; �What Business Does The Provincial Court (Traffic) An �Inferior Court�, Have Sticking It's Nose Where It Doesn't Belong?� Under the Act,\"ONLY� the Alberta Transportation and Safety Board is the �Court of Original Jurisdiction and First Instance� (or at least it's supposed to be). Both the Minister of Justice(J. Denis) and the Minister of Transportation(W. Drysdale) know whats going on, and I will be referring to that shortly. The �Inferior Court� being the  Provincial Court of Alberta (Traffic) by �USURPING THE JURISDICTION� of the Alberta Transportation Safety Board, is involved in a FRAUD. The �Superior Court� being the Alberta Transportation and Safety Board, CANNOT DELEGATE any of it's Powers or Jurisdiction to the �Inferior Court� as this would be an UNCONSTITUTIONAL DELEGATION  and a FRAUD.\n\n            Discussions between the Minister of Transportation and the Minister of Justice are currently underway to �QUIETLY TRANSFER OUT� of the Provincial Court System this �FRAUDULENT and ILLEGAL TRAFFIC COURT�(and not for the reasons that they claim) and to set up a type of Adjudicator answerable only to the Alberta Transportation Safety Board, where the matter �HAS ALWAYS BELONGED�. The people opposed to this plan are naturally the Traffic Ticket Agents,also the Traffic Court Commissioners,  the crown prosecutors , and others (including the Police) involved in this �CORRUPT AND FRAUDULENT INDUSTRY� centered in and around  the Provincial Court (Traffic) ,who stand to lose their jobs. A tip from a friend revealed that  questions concerning these issues would be brought forward by Wild Rose justice critic Mr. Shane Saskiw  and Liberal justice critic Ms. Laurie Blakeman, during Question Period in the Legislature on Thurday, April 10, 2014. They both weighed in on the Minister of Justice, as to the Erosion of Civil Rights  and the Right to Confront Your Accuser in a Court of Law. The Minister was able to deflect their questions  by claiming that Any Talks Were Preliminary and Nothing Had Been Decided, and that any defendant would always be able to confront their accusers. It appeared, although I may be wrong that both the honorable members Blakeman and Saskiw appeared to be in  �Lockstep�, in representing the interests of the Traffic Ticket Agents and their associates, and I believe failed to ask the �Real Question� of why the matter was in the Provincial Court (Traffic) in the first place? \n\n        As you probably know, the �REAL ANSWER� to the question ( $41,300,000 in revenue from traffic fines for 2013 in Edmonton alone) is�Money�. Pursuant to sec. 7.1(1)(2) \"REVENUE OFFSET\" of the Provincial Offenses Procedure Act , Procedures Regulation, Alberta Regulation 233/1989,  the Crown (prosecutors) can claim �16.67 %\" of all fines collected by the traffic court, with the balance going pursuant to sec. 162(1) of the Traffic Safety Act, to the municipality where the alleged offense occurred, usually into their police budgets. Little wonder that these so called crown prosecutors �FRAUDULENTLY STEER� traffic violations towards the�COURT THAT THEY CONTROLLED�, 16.67% of $41.3 million(plus) is,( let me do the math) at least $ 6,884,710.00 if not more, in Edmonton alone for 2013,and possibly $ 100 MILLION PLUS for the Province as a whole, and these �CROOKS� claim that they represent the Minister of Justice, sure they do, or do they really(only he can answer that)? Money corrupts and has corrupted our Courts of Justice. (contact  Shannon Prithipaul (pres. edmt. crim. trial lawyers assoc.)concerning the defunding of Legal Aid)\n\n           Upon Reading The Entire �Traffic Safety Act�, the Provincial Court of Alberta is �NOT MENTIONED ONCE�, the only Courts ever mentioned are the Alberta Transportation Safety Board and the Court of Queen's Bench. These so called crown prosecutors will argue that the sec. 2 of the Provincial Offenses Procedure Act allows them to bring the issue before the Provincial Court(traffic). They will claim that sec. 2 of the Act states that;   \"... this Act  applies to every case in which a person commits or is suspected of committing an offense...\", Thats All Fine And Good , however they FRAUDULENTLY AND DELIBERATELY FAIL TO INFORM any defendant who they prosecute (persecute), that the First Part Of That Sentence that they refer to under the Act, starts out by stating; \"SUBJECT  TO ANY EXPRESS PROVISION IN ANOTHER ACT, \"....blah,blah, blah (you know the rest). Most people reading this sentence,( if they knew where to look and what to look for) would not know and fail to understand what it really meant, and would think it to be meaningless Legal Gibberish. If one breaks down the sentence, it's quite simple;\n\n            Ques:   What does \"Subject To\" mean?   Ans:  Anyone who has bought or sold real estate knows, any present or former real estate agents know, any first year law student knows, any lawyer engaged in  real estate conveyancing knows,  most if not all lawyers know. Most English speaking, moderately intelligent people in the world know what it means, its an \"ESCAPE CLAUSE\".It would appear however, that certain so called crown prosecutors  have never heard of this Legal Phrase and don�t know it�s true meaning, and they claim to have gone to law school(  were they asleep during classes).\n\n            Ques:   What does \" Any Express Provision\" mean?    Ans:    Anything Expressly Provided.  Ques:  What is Expressly Provided ?  Ans: \"Permission\" must be Expressly Provided. Ques: by who or what must this Permission be Expressly provided by?     Ans.  Hold on it�s\ncoming.\n\n             Ques:   What does \"In Another Act\" mean\"?      Ans:  In Another Act      Ques:   What other Act?       Ans: The Traffic Safety Act, this Permission is to be expressly provided by the Alberta Transportation Safety Board, THATS WHO.\n\nI maintain that the Best Place To Hide Anything is in \"PLAIN SIGHT\", especially if you wish to Confuse, Lie To, Cheat, and otherwise Rip Off People, who don't know any law and certainly don't know how to defend themselves against these so called crown prosecutors, who are deliberately out to take advantage of them. The phrase that I have been referring to, �SUBJECT TO ANY EXPRESS PROVISION IN ANOTHER ACT� is located in the FIRST PART, of the FIRST SENTENCE, of the FIRST REAL PARAGRAPH( being sec. 2), in the Provincial Offenses Procedure Act. This is just part of the MASSIVE FRAUD(and there�s more) being practiced in the Provincial Court (Traffic). I would ask at this time that that you support my Call For and Demand, that the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Transportation and the Premier of Alberta appoint a PUBLIC INQUIRY into the Fraudulent Operations of the Provincial Court of Alberta (Traffic) and into the Fraudulent Conduct of the so called crown prosecutors, the Traffic Court Commissioners and the police who operate this Criminal Enterprise. Further that all Present and Future Prosecutions in the Provincial Court (Traffic) be Suspended pending the Outcome of this Public Inquiry.  If your interested in knowing more about these issues, give me a call at Res. 000 000 0000, Cell. 000 000 0000.        DON�T BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT\n I�VE JUST SAID,      CHECK IT OUT YOURSELF.          \n\nRegards ,  XXXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
