   "message": "Ok, you will send a Notice of Mistake to these cops, you will need a CERTIFIED copy of the Birth Certificate with the Notice of Mistake.\n\nYou will draft an AFFIRMATION, saying WHO you are, and WHO you are not, and identify the Notice of Mistake as exhibit A, and the Birth Certificate as exhibit B on this AFFIRMATION.\n\nMaybe Aladdin Sane could help you to do this in English....\n\nYou will send all this REGISTERED MAIL to these cops, and whoever is participating to this, ie: Court, Justice of the Peace, Clerk or whatever.....\n\nAladdin, I know you've done this before, if you can help the guy, that would be great...\n\nMaybe Michael A Rivera could help as well, he did it too :)\n\nThanks\nPete.",
