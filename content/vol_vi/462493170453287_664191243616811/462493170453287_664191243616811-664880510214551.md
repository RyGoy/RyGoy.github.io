   "message": "One of the most important things that you must do, David, is realize that all this is in fiction. You have the weekend now to read and think about how this fictional world of commerce relates to, (a) the man and, (b) the fiction(person). You must think out in your mind why you have the right to refuse surety for the name. I know that this is hard to do but you must try and use that anger as incentive to learn. You have gained much here already in the short time that you have been here. You are given the truth here to work with. THIS IS A GIFT/PROMISE FROM SCOTT. You are in a position to figure all of this out yourself with just minimal help. It's all here. I am going to search for related articles for you to read as well. My wife is going to visit with her mother on Monday for 4 weeks. It's been hectic here today and will be till the plane departs Monday evening. I will have full time here then.",
