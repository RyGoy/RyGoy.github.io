   "message": "Sir Harry Gibbs was a member of the High Court of Australia\nfrom 1970 to 1981 and the Chief Justice of the High Court of\nAustralia from 1981 to 1987. He stated:\n�When this evidence is reinforced with the contents of the\nCharter of the United Nations, the continued usage of any\nlegislation that owes its very legitimacy to the parliament\nof an acknowledged foreign power cannot be supported\nby either legal opinion or indeed historical evidence. I\ntherefore have come to the conclusion that the current\nlegal and political system in use in Australia and its States\nand Territories has no basis in law.�\n\n",
