   "message": "This kinda reminds me of when the \"information superhighway\" first became \"graphical\", ï¿½if that was the correct term at the time. I took to that like \"a fat kid on a smartie\". Learned html right away and started creating pages all graphics and stuff! :D \n\nThen there came Dreamweaver and the like... to take over myself having to really know how to program the page and just being able to make one \"wysiwyg\" style... :/ \n\nThis is where we can all learn to write software that just does what we want it to do. And shortly enough, someone will write software to complete a transaction according to contract \"wysiwyg\". Say, for instance, I have a business that has value. Someone wants something from that value but they only have debt money to pay... I/They can punch in a transaction (contract) that says, \"exchange this guys shitty money of debt for BERTACOIN\", and it does. \n\nI'm talking to myself here... :/",
