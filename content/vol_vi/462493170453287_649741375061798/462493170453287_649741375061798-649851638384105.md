   "message": "I see ALL this within one context: The Nobility and the Banker juice are at war. That's reality. Whatever else we \"think\" is happening, it's just serving THAT agenda.\n\nWithin that context, the bankers have a good grip on governments/people, due to their almost complete control of the banking system, legal system, and communications systems.\n\nHow can the nobility \"fight\" for control, and survival? When you have power, you get people to do stuff for you. So the nobility has come-up with a \"plan\"  (that has been in the planning for many years, for what appears) to get rid of bankers, the \"law society\", centralized accounting, and governments that serve that particular agenda, and come out victorious, once again. Thus regain a say in all new banking system, legal system, and communications systems.\n\nSo, the nobility has deployed the tools to crush the bankers, the \"law society\" and centralized accounting.  Tools that will substitute those \"societies\", and bankers  with a new breed (under control), and at the same time an entire new world, banking, finance and a new form of government will arise from using it: Bitcoin protocol,  Ethereum code, and science. It is UNSTOPPABLE now. Too late.\n\nThat's the way I see it.",
