   "message": "Words have no more power and meaning than that which we each CHOOSE to give them. The concept that \"you can only use certain words if your skin is a certain colour\" is not only ridiculous, but RACIST! The fact that the use of the word \"nigger\" is not only acceptable, but pretty much EXPECTED from your average rap star or black comedian, but is considered an offensive \"racial slur\" if used by someone whose skin happens to be of a different shade, IS FUCKING RETARDED!!!\n\nThese are WORDS. A collection of letters strung together to make a specific sound when pronounced. They are not weapons. They cannot harm you. Taking offence when someone chooses to make up new words, poking fun at the entire ludicrous concept, is an even DUMBER idea.",
