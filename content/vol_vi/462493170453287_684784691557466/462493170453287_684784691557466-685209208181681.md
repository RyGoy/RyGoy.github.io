   "message": "Reading the \"Feminist\" thread of Scott's....she really is for Affirmative Action in the workplace.  Here is a brief glimpse after Ceit had already explained and negated \"Affirmative Action\" mandates:\n\nNo it isn't, Ceit. Affirmative action is saying 'we are not willingly inviting you to compete and contribute, so mandates are in place to curb our practice of intentionally excluding you based on your color.' Who wants that? I would love the pride of knowing I absolutely CRUSHED all competition to win something, but even when that's the case, (and, it certainly has been, for me and my siblings, on occasion) certain people cry it's just because of affirmative action. You think controllers and oppressors are open to learning that they are not ACTUALLY superior in any way? You think they want to face that, in reality? I assure you, they don't.\n\nMuch tyranny and oppression!!!",
