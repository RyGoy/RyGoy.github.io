   "message": "\" nigger-\na term that is racist, as long as the speaker of it is not black. Forbidden on most all of television and other forms of public entertainment, at times referenced to as the \"n-word\". However, \"cracker\", a term racist against whites, is a completely acceptable term used in any context of any national broadcast...hmm...\nWhite man: I would like to know why \"cracker\" and, ahem, \"nigger\" are not equally forbidden *white man is put on trial for racist slander* \"\n\nThe Urban Dictionary has the most accurate definitions. :p\nhttp://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nigger",
