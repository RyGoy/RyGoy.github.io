   "message": "FFS!  She got the initial job as she is a hen.  Hens lay eggs; roosters do not.  Roosters are not needed for the begetting of eggs.  So yes, she is \"highly qualified\"; not only for being a chicken, but for being a hen that is ABLE to lay the light brown eggs I desire.  \n\nDo other hens lay light brown eggs?  Yes, they do!  However, I do not desire their personalities like I do this particular breed of hen.  \n\nTara, I do hope this clears things up for you and Beverly as I sincerely doubt that anyone wants to hear about chickens.  :p",
