   "message": "Lani Black will never admit this (even to herself, I'm sure), but of all the people who were involved in that conversation, the only racist was her. If you choose to define yourself as \"a woman of colour\" rather than simply a human being, all you are doing is facilitating the same segregation that you claim to so vehemently abhor. \n\nResenting people because of the colour of their skin (something that none of us had any control over) is NO different than hating them for it. That prejudice leaks into every aspect of your life. It colours (no pun intended) your assessment of every comment and interaction. \n\nThis was not the first such conversation, it was merely the last. For reference, find the \"feminism/equality\" thread that Scott posted on his page not too long ago, and read the ensuing verbal debate. \n\nIf you bear a particular prejudice against an individual and/or group of individuals, then that prejudice will change your interpretation of their words and actions. This makes it impossible to have ANY sort of open and meaningful dialogue on ANY subject. \n\nSince I have been blocked, chances of her ever reading this are slim, but for the record , Lani Black: YOU are far more concerned about the colour of your skin than ANY of us are.",
