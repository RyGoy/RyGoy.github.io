   "message": "Apparently it is now presumed you are lying about not drinking and driving and you must prove otherwise.\nI was stopped at a check and I asked why I was being stopped. He said he wasn't stopping ME (could have fooled me). It was a check for drunk driving and valid licenses and insurance. So I gave the prick the license. Then was asked if I had anything to drink this evening. They DO know that in order for one to live, one must drink......right? At this point my options were to say sweet \"F\" all and end up being hauled off anyway, tell him it is none of his business and get hauled off, or be honest and up front and hope he isn't a complete steroid junky moron (I realize the odds). \"Yup. I had a couple of sips of his at dinner.\" He then said, \"So if I was to ask you to blow for me...\" I interrupted with \"I would say, 'No'.\" He, of course, got really offended as some men seem to think it is their right to have you blow for them. There was some discussion about providing proof and swearing affidavit. He threatened to haul ME to jail and criminally charge the person. At this point I WANT to say \"I don't go anywhere with strange men with guns, and I don't blow for ANYONE for free (unless I initiate)\", but I am sure my passenger would have been even more horrified with my non-compliant behaviour so I simply repeated \"No\". He then took the license and \"ran\" it then came back and blablablaed about how he was going to \"let\" me leave THIS time and IF he had a partner with him he would have hauled me off so I better be good next time and blow even if I haven't drank a drop. \nI am curious as to where I would have led them to believe I am to be violated at their whim. When I signed for the driver's license, is an answer I have been told. That can be easily fixed with notice, however, I know the next moron who blocks my travels won't give a rats ass about any notice. I also don't think that signing for a driver's license IS where that presumption comes from. Please correct me if I am wrong, but is not signing for the license agreeing to follow the rules of the road? And if one has NOT broken ANY of those rules when pulled over, does that not mean I have every right to keep going until proven otherwise? AT LEAST produce reasonable evidence that suggests I AM breaking one of those rules. The mere fact of being pulled over in the first place is already violating MY time, but I KNOW if I was to tell him THAT, I probably wouldn't be typing this.",
