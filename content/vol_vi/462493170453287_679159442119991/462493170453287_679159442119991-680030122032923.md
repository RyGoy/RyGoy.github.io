   "message": "This Peter from Privatis.me equated it as- the film-stereotype that a vampire cant come into your house, unless, you INVITED him in to begin with. Hence- as Ontario is a common law jurisdiction, and BAR-members are from a FOREIGN jurisdiction, they are unable to deal with you unless you deal with them in ANY way. The line he said to use with them Scott was something like- \"I do not waive my objection to venue\"...is there anything to this, too?",
