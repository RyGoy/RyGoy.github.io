   "message": "Hmmmm, Chip Douglas, I get the feeling that maybe, after she deflected surety for the person (if that is what she did) the justice was requesting to be appointed  trustee so that he could act as administrator on the person's behalf.\n\nIt reminds me of a similar situation for dean clifford, where he could only have the assistance and protection of the Aquilae Trust once he requested it, because Dean CLIFFORD has been liened into the Aquilae trust, so any and all matters pertaining to Dean CLIFFORD would be outside of the court's jurisdiction...my apologies if I have not recalled the details accurately.",
