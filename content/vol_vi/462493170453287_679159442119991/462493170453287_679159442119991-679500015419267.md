   "message": "Old courthouses with the two jury boxes necessary to accommodate the 24 jurors of a grand jury can still be seen.[25] The grand jury would evaluate charges and return what was called a \"true bill (of indictment)\" if the charges were to proceed.[26] or a verdict of nolle prosequi if not.[24] The practice gradually disappeared in Canada over the course of the twentieth century, after being the subject of extended discussions late in the 19th.[24] It was ultimately abolished in 1984 when the Nova Scotia courts formally ended the practice.",
