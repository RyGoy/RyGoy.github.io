But, you finally are on to something!\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that part of the programing is for us to always identify the problem, immediately blame someone else, and never actually do anything about it. It's the bankers, it's the government, it's white people, it's the devil, anybody but OURSELVES.\n\nI stopped blaming everyone, and came to accept full responsibility for my life. Nobody was deceiving me. I was a willing participant, and I was deceiving myself. But not any more.",
