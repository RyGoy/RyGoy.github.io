   "message": "\"Natural Harvest � A collection of semen-based recipes was written in 2008 after about 2 years of experimenting with semen cooking. The idea of cooking with semen came to me during a dinner party with some friends, where we discussed that us men want our partner to swallow, yet don�t want to taste it ourselves. I came to the conclusion that we should also ingest our own semen and a little while later I tried ejaculating into a hot frying pan. The first semen recipe was born and I began work on my semen cookbook.\"\n\nHow do you go from saucy dinner-party conversation, to jerking off into a frying pan? Come on boys, someone chime in here...I require the \"male perspective\" on this one. How DOES one get to that point? :D",
