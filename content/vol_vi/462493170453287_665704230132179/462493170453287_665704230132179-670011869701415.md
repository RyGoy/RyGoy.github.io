   "message": "BE the \"MAN\"!\n\nTry this self-improvement method! It's an ancient Quebecois Form of meditation:\n\nFirst make sure you have a glass of crappy red wine, and some REALLY raunchy cigarettes. When you are drunk and coughing, that's when you start to become a REAL man.\n\nNext, close you eyes and take long, deep, breaths...\n\n...Feel the manliness build. \n\n...as you breathe, you will feel the urge to emit the battle-cry of the Manly Quebecois! \n\n\"....HELLOS?\"",
