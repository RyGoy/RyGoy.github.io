   "message": "The second one is a RED rubber stamp that says: SEE BACK FOR ENDORSEMENT.\n\nI put that sucker on the fron as well, so the one that receives this completed BoE, has no choice to turn that completed BoE, to see back for endorsement :D\n\nApparently (not sure at 100%) if I don't do that, they have no obligation to turn that BoE, and can ASSUME that I haven't PAID for the debt, and I have made a mistake, so, I take no chances :P",
