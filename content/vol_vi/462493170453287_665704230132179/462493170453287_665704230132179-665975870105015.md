   "message": "Well, I get it, as in the upper part / statement IS the debt ? \n\nActually, I picked up a NEW statement in WB's mailbox for one debt that's been administrated already, but I have reasons to believe they may just have not received their payment from WB's SURETY by the time they sent out this new STATEMENT AND COUPON...\n\nThat would seem to mean I did not actually buy that debt back when the voucher was detached ? Seems like it has not yet been bought/paid for ? If I had bought it, then they would have returned the vouchers REFUSED, right ? \n\nBut even if it may SEEM like it, the INSTRUCTIONS I send along should be enough to clear any doubt... As it stands, I have reasons to believe they accepted their instructions and are proceeding...\n\nAnyways... It will be 60 days on Tuesday since they received the Bills of Exchange, and as a good administrator I'll be asking for an update on this account as well as explainations as to why they sent the latest statement... I guess then I'll know what's up with all that...",
