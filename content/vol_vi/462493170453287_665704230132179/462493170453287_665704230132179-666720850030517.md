   "message": "That's some confusing translation there. In English Art.84 says FOR=POUR but then in French it's switched to AU=TO, I don't know if they're equivalent but it seems to me the BoE is to be presented FOR payment TO \"the person from whom he demands payment\" = \" la personne de qui il exige acquittement.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n\nSo I'm confused as to whether this person(BoC) is HOLDING surety/payment or if they ARE surety/payment?                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n\nEither way I think the important part is that once the completed BoE is sent to the Beneficiary there is no obligation on us anymore and what they do or don't do with it is not our fault. Im part frenglish and that FOR/TO bit still sounded weird to me so I thought I should say something.",
