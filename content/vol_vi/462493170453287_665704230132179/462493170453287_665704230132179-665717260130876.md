   "message": "The first one is a Black rubber stamps that says:\n\nBank of Canada\n\nI stamp that sucker on the front of the BoE, because the three parties of a BoE needs to be correctly IDENTIFIED on a BoE.\n\nSo I stamp this one underneath the long series of numbers at the top of the instrument. As I said, I am pretty sure this long series of numbers identifies somehow the Bank of Canada, but I can't prove it, so I take no chances :P",
