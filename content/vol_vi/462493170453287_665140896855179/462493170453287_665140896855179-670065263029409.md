I HAVE to be concise. It's the only way you'll understand the shit you don't know yet.\n\nThere's no \"magic spells\".\n\nThere's no \"secret codes\".\n\n...AND IF SOMEONE CHARGES MONEY FOR \"TRUTH\", THEN IT ISN'T TRUE!\n\nKNOWLEDGE is a RIGHT! IT'S NOT right to keep it SECRET. SECRETS are for people ashamed of what they are doing.",
