   "message": "Ok. So Pete was helping me to administrate a debt that was sent to the person, through the process of BOE. \n\nOn March 11th, I sent them (The legal departement of the electric compagny) the remittance, completed to settle the account along with a letter explaining what i was doing.\n\nMy person received another letter today from the legal departement. This is what it says. (it's translated)\n\nDear sir,\n\nWe confirm we received your letter.\n\nTo check with our client we need proof of payment. We can only accept  a statement of account as proof of payment.\n\nIf you cannot produce this proof, then we expect you to pay within 10 days.\n\nIf you default on the payment we have to start the procedure again.\n\nWith regards,\n\n(signature)\n\nB2C Prelegal Tel: +32 xxxxxxxxxxx \n\nSo they have kept the remittance and still claim the person owe them money.\n\nWhat's is the best course of action now?",
