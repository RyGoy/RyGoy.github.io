   "message": "yes tommy, what he said. just beware some other human who might try to talk to you AND TRY to GET YOU to speak to, on, about, any issue intending to trick you into saying somthing you might not know what you actually did say. for instance if a government employee called you an \"individual\" or a \"resident\" or any of a number of (there are many) 'deceptive 'weasel' words, and you dont know better, they might trick you.\n\nthe cheque stands on its own as a bill of exchange. if somone were to ask you what the word 'deposit' that you wrote on it, not 'for deposit only' but just DEPOSIT. i endorse with just my first name, david, and the account # and write ONLY the word DEPOSIT beneath that.\n\nyou will discover even bank tellers are pretty dumb. they just want to do there job and go home like everyonelse, and leave difficult things to the next guy (who might just happen to be a machine)...",
