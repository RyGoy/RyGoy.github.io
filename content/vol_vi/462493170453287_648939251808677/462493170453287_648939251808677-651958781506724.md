   "message": "Pete DaoustScott Duncan Thanks for allowing me in the group. Can you clarify something about SURETY in the administration process and CRA. Forgive me, I know little and have never done any of this before.  Please correct any misinformation. I am a man, ADMINISTRATING the PERSON on behalf of CRA/ GOV/CORP. I am willingly billing them for my time and services. \"I\" the ADMIN? In terms of the  amount that they say my PERSON owes them I am not disputing  anything I am ADMINISTRATING the ACCOUNT by directing them to the SURETY for the PERSON, which is the BANK OF CANADA? I am asking them to discharge the  ACCOUNT through it's SURETY? I remember a post you had in ADMINSTRATION OF THE PERSON that you would \"not buy back public debts anymore\" such as taxes. Again, forgive me, I read the posts here. I still don't totally understand  how to execute what is being taught.  Thank you  :)",
