   "message": "Seriously Janick Paquette, you get in a car > you wear that seatbelt : / \n\nThe hell the ticket, the law or whatever, do it because you want to lower the chances of your kids losing their mother or parents losing a child or your lover or whatever... You've never been in a car crash, have you ?\n\nThere REALLY are some fuckin irresponsible wakos/slaves out there upon which the government IS ACTUALLY RIGHT to force a LICENSE and STATUTES, and you NEVER KNOW when you'll end up coming across one of those irresponsible wakos/slaves... And you can never trust your car or any other car that something wont break even if you drive extremely safely...\n\nNow 2 tickets = 2 bills... You'll have to administrate both separately.\n\nFor now, dont plea nothing, dont administrate nothing, make copies of both tickets, mark them as copies, and send a very short paragraph asking if it's true that you have the right to use the PERSON's SURETY to DISCHARGE those 2 debts... Sign as the Sole Authorized Administrator and wait...\n\nI got one last year, a parking ticket for which I ACTUALLY had the RIGHT to be parked there... I clearly told them I did not UNDERSTAND the charge BECAUSE they wouldn't give me the definition of the word \"INTERSECTION\" according to whichever jurisdiction applied. Never entered a plea. They got a POS Justice to enter a plea for the PERSON and they sent the fuckin thing asking for money fuckin 8 months later ! I'm not even sure if it's LEGAL to enter a plea on behalf of a PERSON who CLEARLY said DIDNT UNDERSTAND the charge..?",
