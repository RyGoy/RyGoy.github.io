   "message": "Hi guys!\nGot 2 tickets this weekend. \n\n1- Seat belt\n2- didn't have the insurance papers with me.\n\nThe Police officer gave me 2 seperate tickets.\n\nMy question is: If he made 2 seperate tickets to charge the person with 2 violations, do I need to deal with them (tickets) seperately or is it of no significant if I put both ticket numbers on the letter (I am sending with the Bills of Exchange) and send them in the same registered mail enveloppe?\n\n:D",
