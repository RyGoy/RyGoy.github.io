   "message": "\"In an effort to bridge the gap between these two perspectives, we need to remember that every single person has pre-existing, implicit biases. That is, instantaneous judgements that we make about other people. This does not make you a racist; displaying these implicit biases through explicit actions, does. Learning to recognize, manage and understand our implicit biases can and should be a lifelong activity.\"\n\nTRANSLATION: We can \"profile\" because everybody does it, so it's ok.
