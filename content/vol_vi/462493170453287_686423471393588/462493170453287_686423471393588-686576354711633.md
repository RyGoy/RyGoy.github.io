   "message": "Kent, in response to your comment (8 hrs ago), I have no intention of \"changing\" anything that is shared here by Scott.  You are correct, I should have looked up that particular word.  Why I am so cautious now and researching everything is because I have discovered that I have been using certain words incorrectly.  So, since I am aware of those errors, I will now choose to correct my mistakes.  I may be ignorant and my lawful use of words/terms sucks, but I am very receptive to constructive feedback and acting upon it.  Probably why I have not been put in a \"cage\".",
