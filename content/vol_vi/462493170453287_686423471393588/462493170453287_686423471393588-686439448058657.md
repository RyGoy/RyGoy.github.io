   "message": "Another thread I will probably copy and save into a file.  I appreciate it.  Before coming here, I was aware of \"some\" stuff (anytime I see or hear any reference to the \"constitution\", the hair on my neck stood up - to me, a red flag), but as I gradually get through the info here, I am realizing that some of my previous communication(s) may have to be re-done/re-written.  Not the first time I've done stuff incorrectly.  Just as long as I don't make the same freakin' mistakes, it's all good.",
