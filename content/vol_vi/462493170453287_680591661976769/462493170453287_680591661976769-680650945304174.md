   "message": "...before I get to my above homework, one last question for today.\n\nFrom Pete's NOTICE:  \"The first administrative process will be free, courtesy of the Sole Authorized Administrator, which is ME, the Man that have this person.\"\n\nIs there a significant legal difference in saying, \"i, a man\" that administrates this person, instead of \"ME, the Man\"?\n\n1st)  I can't logically claim that I'm \"THE (only) man\" without committing perjury.  However, I can claim i'm a man...or at least a hybrid-monkey.\n\n2nd)  Upper and lower case letters signify different statuses:\n\n- the government may mistakenly know me as Los Monkey Blanc\n- the government may also mistakenly know me as LOS MONKEY BLANC\n- but...the government fraudulently knows me as Los Monkey -BLANC.\n\n- and given all the allowable mistakes in law, i can claim that people refer to me as los monkeyboy (nickname galore) blanc ......(Capitis diminutio minima), no?",
