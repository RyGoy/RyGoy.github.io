   "message": "He quotes the bible. That same bible that says this: \n\n<<Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.  (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)\n\nChristians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed.  If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful.  You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts.  Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them.  (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT)\n\nThe servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he refused to do it.  \"But people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly.  Much is required from those to whom much is given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is given.\"  (Luke 12:47-48 NLT)>>\n\nPete, you are right. This has gotten old.",
