   "message": "SO, here is a synopsis:\n\nPeople claiming to be Moors are LYING TO YOU. Moors want NOTHING to do with you or I. \n\nYou cannot \"Become\" a Moor, any more than you can \"Become\" a Hindu. Moors are separate from society, and wish to be left alone. That's ALL they want. They want NOTHING to do with us. If you read up on the Moors, you will see why I KNOW this guy was lying.\n\nAl-Taqiyya/Al-Kitman -  Methods of lying about Islam. They have instructions on HOW to lie about the religion. That's why they ALL say the same things, even though you KNOW they're lying. They do it because the Quran SAYS so.",
