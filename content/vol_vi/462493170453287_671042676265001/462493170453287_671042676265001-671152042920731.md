   "message": "Plus, how one chooses to use their time and labor is a private choice.  I have nothing against charity, but my private labor has a certain VALUE to ME.  If another being is not interested in bartering or trading, bye bye.  Feel free to go to the Good Will down the street.  \n\nChris is correct.  Those who are \"free\" do not waste time/labor on those who are seeking a \"handout\", and want someone to do it for them.  If you are unwilling to do the necessary research etc. you are missing the focal point of \"being free\".  You have to administrate your OWN private AFFAIRS.",
