   "message": "Now...if you know a bit about our history as so-called \"black\" people then you would know that we were disconnected from the family of nations in a legal sense when we got labeled everything else besides what connects us to the land and our birthrights. On an international level if you are not connected to a Nation then you are recognized as \"undesirable\". Anyway...me personally...I came into this world without any religious,  social, or political persuasions. I was pure and perfect like the rest of you. In short...I came in this world knowing nothing that befouled it; and I plan on leaving the same way.",
