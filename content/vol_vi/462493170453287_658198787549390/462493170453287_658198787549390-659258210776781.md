   "message": "As there is no lawful money in circulation, only debt notes (fiat currency), the buck is offered as valuable consideration on any statement/demand...the 05 (5 cents) is considered the stamp duty for that transaction.\n\nThis value/valuable consideration & stamp duty is provided using postage stamps because they are still considered lawful currency.\n\n(A certified copy of the Birth Certificate may also be offered as valuable consideration and/or sufficient evidence as to who is acting as surety for the person).\n\nUsing the stamps (apparently) then brings international postal law (as well as the inference of mail fraud if false claims are made through the post), bringing the possibility of seeking remedy in the international courts of the Hague ie: a higher jurisdiction bound by international treaty. \n\nThis information is all presented here as theory only, for educational purposes.\n\nWHY?  \n\nBecause I have no firsthand knowledge of this process working, nor have I seen the specific references in the various clubhouse rules \nand how it applies to the person and/or the man seeking remedy.\n\nActing as Sole Authorised Administrator and/or using the clubhouse rules as explained in the various Bills of Exchange Acts and comprehending the principles of accounting, surety and the Notice of Mistake should be more than enough to become a most excellent administrator for the person and deflect surety...several of us here have firsthand knowledge and experience using one or more of those processes.\n\nI hope that helps  ;-)",
