It is attached by a Turing-Complete language/API. The SERVICE can be ATTACHED TO THE CURRENCY ITSELF (See NAMECOIN).\n\nImagine if you were on the Internet in 1984, like me. TRY to grasp the advantages I have JUST BY BEING THERE BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE.\n\n...go on. TRY.\n\nWell that's where you are NOW, only with MONEY/LAW ITSELF! \n\n...but first I must collapse the banking system and start a war.\n\nSo while I'm busy with THAT, you should be studying :D",
