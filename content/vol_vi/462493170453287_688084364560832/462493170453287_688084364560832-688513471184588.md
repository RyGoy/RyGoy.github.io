   "message": "Ok, so to be able to create any value on the ethereum network, it appears that one needs to know how to code or at least have a decent working understanding of coding.\n\nGeneral Question to those in the group with knowledge on the subject:  If English is the language of commerce,  what is the equivalent code/language on Ethereum?\n\nIn other words, what is the most useful coding language to learn?  Are there several?  If so, which ones are the most user friendly for a noob like me?\n\nThese may seem like naive questions, but I wish to make efficient use of the information and fasttrack my efforts, so any assistance would be appreciated.\n\nIn short, where is the best place to LEARN now, in order to be able to RULE or at least add VALUE later?\n\nThanks :D",
