   "message": "If you are forced to interact with the cops it's because of their intent to cause you harm. Wether its a ticket or a beating the intent is the same. I learned from my last incounter to not answer any questions. I have a DL and insurance but no obligation to carry it. The have many ways to creat joinder, I have no obligation to incriminate myself by carrying that person in my pocket. So as to not get beat up I give the taken name and declare my right to remain silent. It's an act of war in their eyes and I never know how they will respond, last time it was a fake ticket for the same thing I was assaulted for the year previous. The arbitrary nature of policing allows the crazies to go ape shit. I can stand on what I know as I have no kids to cart around, it's a pickle either way. Stand for the invoice or play along and administrate later.",
