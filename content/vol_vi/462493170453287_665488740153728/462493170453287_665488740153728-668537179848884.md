   "message": "Besides handing the DL, and registration, I feel I should not answer questions. They can fabricate evidence if they want, but I know the only things that could be used against my person, are my OWN words. I don't transport guns, or drugs, and I don't have a criminal record.\n\nAt the same time, on these days it's almost a death wish to \"not cooperate\" or \"not obey\", for I see the videos EVERY DAY of people getting shot for NOTHING. It gets even more complicated if you have other innocent people in the car with you.",
