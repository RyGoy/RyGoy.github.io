   "message": "Stopped us coming back from a pub watching the Mtl - Boston game... For some reason, they hate the PERSON'S car and they spot it from miles away...\nTook a corner a bit fast but not over limit, 5 police cars were just around the bend...\n\nAsked if we were coming back from the Mtl game, I replied \"No... ME I'm coming back from a Boston Bruins game...\" smiling... I knew I had him right there !\n\nSaid he smelled alcohol, asked to step out the car, said I HAD to blow his machine... I asked if it was an OBLIGATION, he said \"If you don't blow you're not out of here\"...\n\nWasn't ID'ed when they sat me on the backseat... \n\nThey asked if that was MY car, I said it was the PERSON's... and it all started there... I am NOT the PERSON. I HAVE a PERSON and it's not my FAULT...\n\nDid not have the license on me. Told them \"the PERSON's license is in the PERSONS's car...\" so the female officer went crazy, she went out to the PERSON's car and asked my friend to give it to her, which he did.\n\nDuring that time, the male officer made me blow his machine, yes I did. I KNOW I KNOW I should have refused firmly, but wasn't ready to go through a never ending discussion on my first encounter ever since I started learning here... \nI wasn't even ID'ed at that point and KNEW I wasn't going to ID as the PERSON... I was also 100% sure I wasn't over the limit. Now I have an even better idea how many beers = OK ;)\n\nEvery question they asked, I told them the truth...\nAND THEY GOT PISSED ! Especially the girl.\nAnd especially when I said I could PROVE it all even if I didn't expect them to understand any of this and I didn't feel like wasting an hour sitting on that tight plastic seat...\n\nAnyways, the female officer came back...\nHey that's your face on the license ?\nWell that's a mistake I intend to correct the next time they want MY face for the PERSON's license... I'm the Sole Authorized Administrator, nothing else. If that piece of ID is misleading to you that isn't my FAULT...\n\nThey tried to ID the PERSON with the address, like \"where do you live\" and I reply \"I live in the area up there\"... \nor : OH Hey here's his address on the license... \"Nah sorry, that's the PERSON's address...\"\n\nOr \"what's your first and last names\" : \"Sorry, first and last names are for PERSONS, I'm not a PERSON. I have one... I know you guys may think this sounds stupid, but I can prove everything I'm saying\"\n\nOr \"what do you do in life\" (meaning for a living) to which I replied \"If you're asking about the PERSON, it does a lot of stuff, but that's not ME... ME I like to ride bicycles and read law stuff\"...\n\nAt one point he even mentioned something like \"I could tell you read law\"...\n\nMANY TIMES he asked if I only had alcohol, I repeatedly told him I don't eat, smoke, inject drugs nor am I medicated and a blood test could prove it, but I \"politely\" asked if a blood test was an obligation to prove he didn't smell drugs ?\n\nThey scanned the system for the PERSON, found nothing. Had nothing at all to try and squeeze ME... And all along, I kept smiling and remained uber calm...\n\nAll said and done, that encounter helped build some confidence. Next time should be more fun ;)",
