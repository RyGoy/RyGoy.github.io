   "message": "Scott or Pete here is a question for either of you. I`ll Take a stab at answering myself but here goes I was not born in Canaduh I was a by product of West Germany by a Canadian father and German mother . When i was 11 it was explained to me that if i didn`t become a Canadian citizen  i could become interned in a camp should Canaduh ever go to war with Germany again much like the Japanese during WW2. So under duress i gave up dual nationality and became a person of Canadian descent . I'm guessing the surety in my case would be the name of the citizenship certificate as no B/C exists",
