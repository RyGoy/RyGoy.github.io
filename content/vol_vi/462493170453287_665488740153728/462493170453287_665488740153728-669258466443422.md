   "message": "In Fran�ais, fuck anyone who dares to address ME as Monsieur, Sir, or whatever. I tell them all... even my clients and suppliers, when you talk to ME, it's WILL and NOTHING ELSE ! No \"\"Mister LASTNAME\" or shit I'm easygoing you know ;) ... \n\nWhen they deal with BELL, they don't call the guy over the phone \"Hey BELL\"... So I refused to be called FIRSTNAME LASTNAME. I'm WILL.\n\nI tell them ALL UPFORNT : Ok, on peux tu commencer par se dire \"TU\" et laisser faire les \"MONSIEUR\" \"MADAME\" ? Je ne suis le subordonn� de personne, et vous autres non plus... Surprisingly, it makes them much more friendly and easier to deal with, they like that... Same when I call VIdeotron or speak to any other business employee, \"Hey OK let's make it simple, I'm WILL, on peut tu se dire TU ?\" Usually they reply they HAVE to \"vouvoyer?\" their customers, I tell them \"do as you wish, but let it be clear that I'm not \"VOUS\" and I'll only reply because you have notified ME that you'll be calling ME by that word, even though you don't know what it means...\"\n\nSimply teach your kids to ask people if they wish to be addressed as \"monsieur\" or \"madame\" or something else, but that they don't want to be addressed as such by any means...",
