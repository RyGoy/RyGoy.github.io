   "message": "or Certificate of Baptism? <<If you are using the baptismal certificate for identification purposes alone then no you cannot use it in place of a birth certificate. However, if when you go to get a certified copy of your birth certificate and there is no record of you then you can use the baptismal certificate along with other items to establish that you were born in this country and get the birth certificate or a passport. This often happens to people who were born 70+ years ago. They may have a certificate of live birth but no birth certificate was ever registered. The certificate of live birth is not sufficient since 9 11 for ID purposes.>>",
