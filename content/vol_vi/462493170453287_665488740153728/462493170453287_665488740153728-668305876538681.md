   "message": "That's something tricky I now try to avoid...\n\nALL names are filed somewhere. If it's filed somewhere else than ONLY in MY pocket, smells fishy.\n\nME, people most always call me Will, but sometimes also call me Wallace, BigUncle, MonGars, TheMan, even Tabarnak and shit like that and those are not names, let alone MINE. But depending on who calls it, I KNOW they may be talking to ME...\n\nIf a fucktard asks ME, names are for PERSONs. PERIOD. \nLet's avoid any confusion, it could lead to so much useless trouble... \n\nSo THE PERSON's NAME is the PERSON's and \"my name is not Will\" or whatever else...\nI \"AM\" Will... You can call ME that. But I dont HAVE the name \"Will\"... It's not MINE. \n\nDetaching from the NAME is one thing I wiped from my mind quite a few years ago actually, when THE PERSON's NAME got its tax numbers... Everyone calling THE PERSON's NAME are for business. Friends NEVER use THE PERSON's NAME when they talk to ME...\n\nAnd so many other guys in the world also go by 'Will\"...\nSome people may use it to call ME, but even THAT is not MY FAULT... I didn't choose a name for ME... But the Government really wants to trick ME into using the name they have on file... :(\n\nIf you don't own a TradeMark for \"Will\" you have no reason for questioning ME about that name, or any name, trying to squeeze ME. I'm not interested. And if you own a TM, well... Sorry, TM are for commerce, and MEN are not in commerce.\nAnd if you have a problem with that, go try to find a PERSON to talk to, the PERSON I have it doesn't have a tongue and it cannot talk.\n\nWhen you tell them \"THAT is NOT �MY� name\" it does seem to screw them up, but they also tend to want to screw you back in return... And they tend to see you as some kind of idiot they can bash on... \nBeen there once. Wont happen twice. I can trust ME on that one ;)",
