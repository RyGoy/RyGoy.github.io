   "message": "Now what they sent me. You can notice how they always bullshit. First on the 25th they said the court finds no reason to respond and that I have a public defender. Hahahaha when I just fired him and they know it, then the very next day 26th dismissed by state and on the 27th officially stated as NOLLE PROSEQUI. Mind you that even the night before the cancelled trial the lawyer who is fired still called me on a Sunday night to try to convince me to go to court on Monday. I told him he could go and waste his time but the court already has Michael Rivera and the account is settled. Thats what they want to trick you into appearing. If I would have appeared then I would have been accepting SURETY all over again and would have tried to talk my way out and one little mistake on my part would have been very painful.",
