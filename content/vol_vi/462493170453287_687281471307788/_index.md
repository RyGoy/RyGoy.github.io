   "message": "We depend on words. We place enormous faith in words, that they mean and sound as intended, in order to live in this world. We �trust� words using words like �trust� (from 12th Century Latin trausti = \"an approved agreement, deed, oath or alliance as a subject of the church\") Its claimed origins from Old Norse deliberately misleading.\n\n    Is this what you mean when you use, write and speak the word �trust�? Have you consented to an oath or alliance as a subject of the Roman Cult enthroned at Vatican Hill? Maybe you have, maybe you have not. But most people would never have heard of this original and primary meaning, the true intended meaning of the constructed word.\n\n    Why is the first meaning of a word important anyway? We are taught that words are pegs upon which ideas are attached, mere tools to convey meaning, not really having any �great and mystical power�. Yet this deliberate confused teaching is in direct contradiction to the very nature of words and their vocal pronunciation throughout history. Words are power, special words have special power.\n    The ancient belief in words having \"magical\" power\n\n    So thought the Egyptians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Greeks, the Romans and all ancient civilizations that created new forms of writing, attached meaning to the arrangement of symbols including meaningful sound.\n\n    From the very beginning of civilization itself, words themselves were magical, and to know the true meaning of a word and its origins was to hold in your grasp real power.\n    The origins of words and power\n\n    It is one thing to forget the precedence of history that the true meaning of a word is power, it is another thing entirely to forget that all language, all language created by men and women has a single point of origin, an architect.\n    As it happens, there are specific points and individuals in history that excelled in the creation of new words and meanings with then long periods of use, or eventual decline.\n    Why are the true original meaning of so many words hidden?\n\n    So how come the original meaning of �trust� is hidden? How come the original meaning of so many words we take for granted --for example understand meaning �To stand under the authority of the Church (Roman Cult)� are also deliberately hidden?\n\n    The answer is simple, �they� do not want you to know the true nature and meaning of the words you use every day without ever questioning what you are actually saying under �their� system from �person�, to �claim�, to �deposit� to even the word �law� itself.\n    The catch-22 of modern law and meaning of key words\n\n    A classic of why this system of deliberate hidding meaning is in place is in regards to the practical operation of local, national and international law.\n\n    Many a bright person who has studied law soon identify key words that have important power within the legal system--REGINA meaning \"The Crown\" is one such example. But unless an individual can demonstrate to the Court an understanding and precedence of the legal terms being used, the knowledge of key legal terms and ancient legal phrases are of little use.\n\n    But when an individual is capable of demonstrating a real understanding of words within a Court, then it is possible to shift the power almost immediately to your favour to some degree.\n    The intention of this lexica\n\n    The intention therefore of this lexica is to provide an insight into some of the important legal words of power and control used by modern governments pledging alliance to the present legal system of the Holy See, the �common law� that threads its web throughout almost every single nation on Earth.\n\n    By understanding the original meaning and intention of these words, it is hoped you will better understand the implications of many of the documents and actions you take for granted on a daily basis.\n\n    A\n    B\n    C\n    D\n    E\n    F\n    G\n    H\n    I\n    J\n    K\n    L\n    M\n    N\n    O\n    P\n    Q\n    R\n    S\n    T\n    U\n    V\n    W\n    X\n    Y\n",
