   "message": "The conversation between Dean Clifford and Darren Clifford was disgusting. It was a play for the recording. Dean stated this man's FIRST and LAST NAME no less than 4 times, to someone (Darren) who speaks to this man A LOT! They BOTH KNOW THIS. Well that man was raided by the ETF and rotted in jail for 4 days. He's done NOTHING WRONG. He's done nothing ILLEGAL, nor has he done anything UNLAWFUL. His handling and storage of firearms are what the safety standards SHOULD be...\n\n...and they hurt him, and they hurt his family, and they put him in a cage, because Dean, CLIFFORD made a deal. You can ask Darren,CLIFFORD for the recording in question.",
