   "message": "bond n. 1) written evidence of debt issued by a company with the terms of payment spelled out. A bond differs from corporate shares of stock since bond payments are pre-determined and provide a final pay-off date, while stock dividends vary depending on profitability and corporate decisions to distribute. There are two types of such bonds: \"registered\" in which the name of the owner is recorded by the company and \"bearer\" in which interest payments are made to whomever is holding the bond. 2) written guaranty or pledge which is purchased from a bonding company (usually an insurance firm) or by an individual as security (called a \"bondsman\") to guarantee some form of performance, including showing up in court (\"bail bond\"), properly complete construction or other contract terms (\"performance bond\"), that the bonded party will not steal or mismanage funds, that a purchased article is the real thing, or that title is good. If there is a failure then the bonding company will make good up to the amount of the bond.\n\n\"The process by which an issuer creates a financial instrument\" hahaha  = BOND!!!!  :-D",
