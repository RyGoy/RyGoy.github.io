   "message": "Admiral Scott, if acting as the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR, do we need to RESIGN to all contracts with the government, in order to eliminate all presumptions of JOINDER? \n\nOr should we just qualify our capacity if we need to engage with government, and let the surety take care of the bills? \n\nIt just seems all those licenses create the presumption of joinder. But at the same time, I am not scared to deal with government as the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR. \n\nI have my thoughts about it, but I wanted to hear your knowledge about these contracts with the government. I am sure a few people probably have thought of the same questions. \n\nThank you for another great article.",
