   "message": "Until something else is in place, the way I see it is that: shit, it's not my fault! As long as I operate, and qualify my role as the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR, what do I have to worry about? I know about surety, and accounting. If I am \"taking care of business\",  what's to worry? Are they going to shoot me? :/ \n\nBut we are programmed to be irresponsible, and to hide our heads under the sand. So I heard many times people saying \"you must quit all contracts with government.\" That always seemed illogical to me. Like magically disappearing from the commercial reality.\n\nSo, it's good to put to rest that you don't have to fear the person you happen to have in your pocket. I have been asked that questions a few times lately, and perhaps newbies won't go that route. It just really bothers me to hear you have to fear shit, I hate that non-sense. \n\nThanks for your answers, Beverly, and Scott!",
