   "message": "Scott Duncan \"BANK=GOVERNMENT. You had no \"money\" (Value) to secure, so the government MAKES A DEBT in the same manner the bank does. The Consolidated Revenue Fund is the ACCOUNT FOR THAT DEBT. Everyone get that?\"\n\nI do \"get that\"! Since the objective is to bring the system down then the means to achieve it is to make folks aware that they do not need to buy these public debts, they can simply DISCHARGE them. By doing so the outstanding balance of of the CONSOLIDATED REVENUE FUND will begin to grow exponentially very quickly. Therefore what is already unsustainable will be magnified causing the system to implode. Does this about sum it up? :D",
