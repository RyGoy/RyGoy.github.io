You write the cheque, and the bank CERTIFIES that the cheque is ALREADY HONOURED, and they did it by SECURING THE FUNDS. Their seal on your cheque SAYS SO (Certifies it). Let the mechanics of that sink in.......now apply that ACCOUNTING to the BIRTH CERTIFICATE and get REALLY creeped out.\n\n\"...the (PROVINCE OF ONTARIO) CERTIFIES that the (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) is ALREADY HONOURED, and they did it by SECURING THE FUNDS. Their (Registrar General's) SEAL on your (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) SAYS SO (Certifies it). Let the mechanics of that sink in.......now apply that ACCOUNTING to the BIRTH CERTIFICATE and get REALLY creeped out.\"\n\nDid i apply that properly, Scott?",
