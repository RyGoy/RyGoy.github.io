   "message": "They \"secured\" ALL value with the birth certificate. If i write you a Cheque, then that is a PRIVATE matter. If I CERTIFY it, then the bank will withdraw the funds from my account, and honour the cheque with those funds. If I have no funds, but the bank has overdraft benefits, then the certified cheque will pass, but I STILL OWE THE BANK.\n\nBANK=GOVERNMENT. You had no \"money\" (Value) to secure, so the government MAKES A DEBT in the same manner the bank does.\n\nThe Consolidated Revenue Fund is the ACCOUNT FOR THAT DEBT.\n\nEveryone get that?",
