   "message": "Mackximus Minimus questioned way further up about the possible need for resigning from all contracts (as suggested by freedumbers elsewhere):\n\nMy take on this is: Acting as Sole Authorised Administrator, you are facilitating/ensuring that the correct accounts are debited/credited by accepting certain charges via a Bill of Exchange and instructing the beneficiary where to go to have the accounts balanced.\n\nTo take it to the next level:\n\nWhen the person is liened into a private trust, the trust and/or corporate charter can be set up to enable the trustee(s) exclusive use of trust property:\n\nAny of those pre-existing contracts also become property of the private trust, which can be used by (the board of) trustees for their exclusive benefit.\n\nIn effect, enabling the trustee to use licences, passports, Social Security Numbers etc, for the benefit of the new slave master (corporation).\n\nWould this be an accurate summary?",
