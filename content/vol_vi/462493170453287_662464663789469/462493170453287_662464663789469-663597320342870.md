   "message": "Thanks Eamonn ! What a read !\nTook me quite a few reads actually to wrap my head around the whole thing, but I think I�m getting it and feeling stupid about it... Typing this sounds so much like what is explained in Money as Debt III� though I kinda never saw the whole picture� or is it even the whole picture yet ?\n\nSo when a PUBLIC DEBT is sent to a PERSON, \nand we use the Bill of Exchange to discharge that debt,\nthat debt is actually being paid with the unlimited credit / value available to the PERSON \nwhich has already been securitized - as an unlimited ever increasing debt - with the Birth Certificate,\nand we have the RIGHT to allow for it�s unlimited increase, in that sense we not only ARE the only VALUE/CREDITORS for the PERSON, but we have the RIGHT to create DEBT, we are CREDITORS for the Govt\nand the overall sum of all those debts - a huuuge negative amount - is accounted for in the Consolidated Revenue Fund\nand when we use the Birth Certificate to extinguish a PUBLIC DEBT, it�s extinguished by ANOTHER PUBLIC DEBT which did not exist before,\nand they�d like us to keep RE FUNDing their shithole with INCOME tax ?\n\nSo the overall PUBLIC DEBT is ever increasing no matter what we�d like to do about it� It was designed to be that way... And the ONLY WAY to break the system - and eliminate PUBLIC DEBTS - would be for everyone to administrate those debts through the PERSON�s SURETY, until the system implodes by itself due to all those PUBLIC DEBTS only increasing THEIR OWN CRF DEBT to a point where there actually is no positive amount deposited at all to keep their scam afloat ?\n\nSo when a PUBLIC DEBT is sent to a PERSON, and we administrate it through the PERSON�s SURETY, it turns into ANOTHER / A NEW PUBLIC DEBT. The original one has been accounted for, and the new one will be sent around again eventually, and it�ll keep spinning forever and ever increasing but everyone will be happy� \n\nIf I'm getting this right, whoever thought about this entire thing were indeed a bunch of beatable arrogant fucks.",
