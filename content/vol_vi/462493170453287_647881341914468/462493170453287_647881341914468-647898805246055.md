   "message": "The Magistrate Adjourned the case until the 1st of July. Santos Bonacci is planning to use the person's surety to settle the matter via a promissory note, before July 1st 2014. Can this \"work\" at this point?\n\nMy thoughts are that since Santos failed to be acting as the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for the PERSON (he was not ADMINISTRATING the PUBLIC DEBTS being sent to his PERSON), SOMEONE is trying to ADMINISTRATE the ESTATE without authorization, to SETTLE the ACCOUNTING, and also looking for the SURETY. And..  since he applied for bail, and has shown-up twice for the matters of SANTOS BONACCI... smells like SURETY to me. Am I wrong? \n\nHe is double minded, because of \"belief\". As a consequence, he LIES, as well. It's all accounting, and surety. At the end, he had to end-up being called to ACCOUNT for the UNBALANCED BOOKS.",
