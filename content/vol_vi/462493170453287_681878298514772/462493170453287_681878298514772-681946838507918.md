   "message": "The Union Jack has been in use in Canada dating back to the Scottish settlement in Nova Scotia in 1621.[51] At the close of the Great Canadian Flag Debate of 1964, which resulted in the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag as Canada's national flag in 1965, the Parliament of Canada voted to make the Union Flag the symbol of Canada's membership of the Commonwealth and its allegiance to the crown. The move was a concession given to conservatives who preferred to keep the old flag, with its Union Flag in the canton. The Royal Union Flag (as it is now known in Canada) is flown alongside the Maple-Leaf Flag on Commonwealth Day and other royal occasions and anniversaries.[51] The Union Flag was also the official flag of the Dominion of Newfoundland (1931ï¿½1949) and continued after Newfoundland became a Canadian province (now Newfoundland and Labrador) until 1980.",
