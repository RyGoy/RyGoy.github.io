   "message": "Jason Moreland Remember you need 2 signatures and surety for a valid negotiable instrument.\n\nThe document's got both parties' signatures, and I guess SURETY is proven by the lien they had on the PERSON's car until payment of the debt was made in full...\n\nPete Daoust I sent them a recap of everything they didn't do - they haven't replied to the last 3 communications - and all the questions they didn't answer - silence is acceptance of the statements I made - and gave them a final 10 days to act, saying else I may have no choice but to fwd the entire paperwork to the Attorney General of Quebec... They got that one mid last week... Not sure if that'll be scary enough to get them to honour their obligations...",
