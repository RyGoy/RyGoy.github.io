   "message": "OK,\nfew questions about the PROPER NOTICE for idiots:\n\n1) a copy of the Lien on the Vessel.... would that be the Birth Certificat?\n\n2) ... There is now no confusion as to what this document IS, and WHO it is. ... what it is is pretty clear but WHO it is... by putting PUBLIC NOTICE you identify WHO is sending this Legal document? :/ can't connect that one.\n\n3) in the example of the PUBLIC NOTICE, ...the Vessel known as ***redacted shit here***is now the LAWFUL PROPERTY of the AQUILAE TRUST.... do we need to have a Trust to make a PUBLIC NOTICE? :/",
