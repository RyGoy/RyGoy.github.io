   "message": "That's the first option I had in mind, probably the easiest too (?), but I'm still not quite sure yet if I can/wish to put my trust in the justice system or what would be the pro's and con's of each option... \n\nI'm actually kinda lost with what I should tackle first anyways... Trust, maritime, reading Mackx's anthology, reading again all the pinned stuff, not losing track on the newer threads...\n\nAbove all I, wanna learn and I know there's so much valuable knowledge I have yet to gain here, and the empowering potential of this promissory note case seems verrrry valuable...\n\nWithout knowledge, you can have all the time(x)energy you want, you'll still be nothing more than an hyperactive worthless breathing machine, or at best maybe a slave...",
