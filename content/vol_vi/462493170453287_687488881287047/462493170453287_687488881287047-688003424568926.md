   "message": "That's what I'm trying to know ? \n\nHow do you clear a LIVING HUMAN BEING from customs ? Some countries won't allow certain foreign plants or animals - which one would accept a dangerous internet terrï¿½r!st :p ? And actually, what country on Earth would accept to have living human beings come in as freight with no risk for their national security or immigration or other population control program they have going on ?? Cargo has to be shipped to a receiving PERSON, right ? So that means AQUILAE has to ship Scott Duncan to someone who must then take reception of the Man ? Once Scott is received, is AQUILAE still SURETY for the Man on foreign land or is it the receiving party ? Or do you have to set AQUILAE offices wherever you wanna ship Scott, prior to delivering the Man ??\n\nMy brain's spinning again...",
