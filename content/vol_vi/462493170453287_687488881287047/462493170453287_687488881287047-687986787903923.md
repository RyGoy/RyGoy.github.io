   "message": "Well this trip down memory lane has been awesome. Now I think Will asked \"how does this apply to Scott Duncan going as freight ? Well \"First in - First Out\" applies to inventory. If the Admiral is \"freight\" received in a port he is not a PERSON. This would be a very different manner of clearing customs I imagine but he would be processed as any other freight received in the order it was received. This is very intriguing...I LOVE this classroom :D More details please.",
