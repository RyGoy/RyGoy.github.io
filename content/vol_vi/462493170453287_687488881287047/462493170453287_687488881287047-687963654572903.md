   "message": "I loved school. I was a total geek. Loved band class. Loved the library. Loved french. Loved biology, chemistry, english, math, but not physics (girl thing ?). I even liked \"consumer\" education and learning to file \"income\" tax myself. I only hated the part when I discovered that LOTS of what I learned was a lie. \n I now LOVE my computer, because I can learn anything and I am getting better everyday at sifting through the lies.\nWe didn't have grade 13 in BC. Most colleges had what was called University Transfer courses which sounds similar to the gr. 13 thing in Ontario.",
