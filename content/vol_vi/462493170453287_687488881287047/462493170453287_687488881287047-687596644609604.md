   "message": "Bloody hell! I realize that the passport includes admiralty terms...pass-PORT. And the  entire system uses them also i.e. airPORT, PORT-of-CALL. This also seems to make sense when you consider when and why  the UN was formed. How and why exactly was the \"right to travel\" lost Admiral? . Who lost the right to travel...the PERSON or mankind (did the PERSON even exist at that point in time)? I had discovered in my research that the ONTARIO REGISTRAR GENERAL had confirmed that the STATEMENT OF LIVE BIRTH was in fact a passport. Is this accurate or more FREEDUMB bullshit?",
