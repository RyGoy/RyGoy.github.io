   "message": "OK, so I'm in the state of California, U.S.A. I had a traffic ticket. I sent in an Affidavit + Notice of Mistake + Birth certificate (copy), as well as the original ticket and subsequent notices with a red diagonal line through them and \"OFFER DECLINED FOR IMMEDIATE DISCHARGE AND CLOSURE\". \n\n6 days after the court date for the ticket they issued a \"FAILURE TO APPEAR\" notice and suspended my license, and increased the bail to $1094.00 (from one hundred something $ before..). \n\nSo now what?",
