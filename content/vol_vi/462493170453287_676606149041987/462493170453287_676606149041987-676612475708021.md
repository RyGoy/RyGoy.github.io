What affidavit did you submitted?\n\nIt could be you gave nothing in consideration, just a plain copy of the BC,  but not the actual bond. Maybe the accounting was not settled? I don't know.\n\nDo you know why you used the notice of mistake? :/ \n\nI don't know what to tell you, but they are still looking for the surety, and the account has not been settled, that's for sure.",
