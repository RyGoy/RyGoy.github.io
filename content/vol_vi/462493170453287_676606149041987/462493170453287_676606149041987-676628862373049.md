   "message": "Well, unfortunately I need to drive when I'm in CA. to help run errands for my elderly grandparents, and if I'm pulled over with a suspended license they could arrest me and impound my vehicle. \n\nSo is there another option that a person in this situation could take so as to not pay the bail amount AND keep their license?
