   "message": "Yes, once the obligation is met you have a right to the commercial paper / promissory note etc. unfortunately, in the case of the mortgage swindle they never made a legally enforceable negotiable instrument on the loan.  It was backed but chopped up and sold as a commercial security / derivative. If the bank refuses to produce the original note or contract they can be prosecuted.",
