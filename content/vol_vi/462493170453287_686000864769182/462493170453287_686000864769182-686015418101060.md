   "message": "Interest is their fee ? CERTAINLY doesn't work in MY books !\nHere, WB has a credit card with a bank which sends him checks for +/- 500$ a year for creating credit using their card :/ no annual fee nothing...\n\nI think it's more like THEY get to keep the money when you use the PERSON's card... As if they got used to not having creditors coming around claiming the value at the end of each month... Punishing with interests certainly helps to make a creditor believe that he's a slave in debt...",
