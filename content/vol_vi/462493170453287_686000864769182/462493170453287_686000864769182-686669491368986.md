   "message": "Receipts are \"valuable securities\" under the criminal code of canada.\nThey are proof that MEN and WOMEN, as CREDITORS for the PERSONS, used time x energy x knowledge to CREATE something, to produce VALUE.\n\nBut we've been taught to exchange our time and efforts for money from a pool of existing money. So that money is only exchanged, even though we create more and more wealth day after day, we dont create more money / add VALUE in that existing pool of canadian dollars... Bankers control the creating of money and the way they do it, since it doesnt take into consideration what we produce, it devaluates each existing dollar further more... \n\nIsnt there a way for the VALUE we create to become real CREDIT, adding to the pool of existing money ? The birth certificate is an unlimited credit limit and we can use it to create money out of thin air when a public debt is sent to the PERSON... \n\nIf we all decided to sit the fuck down and stop sweating our ass all day long for our person to earn a salary, that country would go kaput fast...\n\nIf credit card companies create money by collecting our receipts and bundleing a bunch of them into one debt at the end of the month and they KEEP that money for themselves when WE are the ones who sweat the fuck out to create value... Something doesnt add up ?\n\nIf we ARE the MONEY and WE are CREDITORS, how can we PROFIT from CREATING all that wealth ??",
