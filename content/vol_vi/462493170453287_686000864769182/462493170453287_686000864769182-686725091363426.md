   "message": "The system is fucked. Sitting there supporting it not trying to figure bullshit out wont fix it.\n\nMy PERSON EARNS MONEY from MY time x energy x knowledge. And I'm totally fine with that, because I can benefit from it.\n\nCREDIT CARDS companies EARN MONEY from MY time x energy x knowledge. And I'm NOT totally fine with that, because I DO NOT benefit from it. THEY DO. VAMPIRES. We dont NEED them to do business... Using them is kind of a FAVOR ? I know I could just stop my PERSON from using their service, but that wouldnt fix the problem.\n\nOnce my PERSON has paid the bill they sent, just like any loan, there must be something that's owed (?) to the CREDITORS for that newly created money which they dont benefit from... There seems to be something missing and I wanna connect those dots...",
