   "message": "Jason Moreland, when my time x energy x knowledge produces something, it is exchanged for money of account.\n\nWhen I go to - say - the restaurant, and WB pays the bill using one of his CREDIT CARDs, issued by a BANK, it seems like that BANK creates NEW MONEY OF ACCOUNT to pay that debt to the restaurant. At the end of the month, they send WB a bill for all those debts that were paid using that CREDIT CARD and they ask WB to DEBIT one of his accounts and send MONEY OF ACCOUNT to that bank which issued the CREDIT CARD.\n\nThey are creating money out of thin air, based on MY time x energy x knowledge which is MY CREDITOR POWER. They know I, as a CREDITOR, \"create enough things of value\" for the PERSON to use their CREDIT CARD and make them make money. They even PAY my PERSON +/- 500$ a year to use their card - AND to allow them to create much more money out of thin air... They NEVER COLLECTED interest from my PERSON, so it must be pretty PROFITABLE for them to keep doing that business ?\n\nIn the end : the MAN is the one sweating his ass, THEY are the ones creating value based on the MAN's time x energy x knowledge, and instead of the MAN's PERSON PROFITING from what has been created, THEY DO because THEY end up with the PERSON's MONEY OF ACCOUNT when they NEVER DEBITED A DAMN CENT in the first place. They make it seem like their monthly bill is a DEBT that has to be paid, but how can it be a DEBT if they NEVER DEBITED ANYTHING ANYWHERE ??\n\nChip Douglas, when you use the birth certificate to extinguish debts, it authorises the Bank of Canada to make a payment. But they have no money. It's only a big debt hole, so they dig out more debt, as new money, to extinguish those debts.\n\nIf I think wrong, please tell me...",
