   "message": "I have had two situations in the past 12 months where I used a credit card:\n\nThe first time, I took the credit card statement from the bank and accepted it as accommodation party, in accordance with the Bills of Exchange Act.\n\nThey kept writing to me, telling me that they didn't accept Bills of Exchange...in the end they supposedly assigned the debt to a debt collection agency...they couldn't produce a contract or proof of assignment of a debt, so after several months, that issue appears to have gone away.\n\nThe second situation (different card), I knew a bit more & have been able to demonstrate that the account statement was an incomplete Bill of Exchange, which has now been completed and appears to be a cheque according to their clubhouse rules re cheques.\n\nI received a late notice, which I called and corrected them that the matter had been dealt with as a cheque had been sent via registered post...that was delivered 3 weeks ago, completed my obligation.\n\nI am awaiting the result of this, because if it is successful, I will make purchases by credit card and just administrate the credit card bill at the end of each month, which seems a lot easier and tidier way of doing things.\n\nI'll keep everyone updated once I get the result of this latest administrative experiment ;-)",
