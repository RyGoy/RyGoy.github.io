   "message": "I think I am missing a piece of the puzzle as well. It's tied in with the idea of our own Bank isn't it? How does this personal credit process go?\n\nFeel free to tear into me on this (because by doing so I will probably get it sorted in my head)...\n\nThe NAME/BC and surety concept, I grasp that, although I'm sure I will stumble a bit with it. I have a person, and it's not my fault.\n\nThe TRUST and holding corporation, I also grasp that. That process is underway for my wife and I. Fleshing out the details...\n\nSole Authorized Administrator, this too, I get... Stamps are ordered and I will be starting out as a NOOB administrator when I get home. I'm sure there are lots of bills waiting for me to administrate when I get home.\n\nCrypto currencies, and the use of them in day to day transactions, I'm learning... I've got a rig, but it isn't performing very well yet. I am also moving money of account to and from etc. I expect that come faster the more I use it.\n\nAs for my work, I'm currently a contract employee, and I'm working  towards changing that from an employee to independent contractor.\n\nBaby steps on each are underway. :)\n\nBut if someone could help me figure out that concept of each of us having our own Bank... That would help a lot...",
