   "message": "From the �YOU ONLY NEED MONEY WHEN YOU ARE SPENDING IT� deptartment.\n\n\"YOU ONLY NEED MONEY WHEN YOU ARE SPENDING IT!\nThe rest of the time MONEY is DEBT and OBLIGATION. HOARDING IT IS STUPID!\nEverybody think about that. I'm saying it for a reason. Get the concept in your head, and cement it there. You'll know why later.\"\n-Scott Duncan.\n\nWell, guess what, I�ve been thinking about this, and I have to admit, the first time I have red this I said to my self��what the fuck he is talking about ?? :/\n\nAnd then a few months later, my thoughts were: What the fuck he is talking about ? :(\n\nYou see where I am going with this, so I have made a little exercise, I went to the store to buy some shit, with NO (what I thought was) MONEY in my pocket, and fuck, I was stuck, no money appeared :(\n\nSo I kept thinking about it, and then, one day, I said to myself, what if I bring some CREDIT with me ? :D\n\nNow, money can easily be CREDIT, so I right away thought INSTANT credit, because he said: YOU ONLY NEED MONEY WHEN YOU ARE SPENDING IT!....so fuck, it have to be an INSTANT thing, :/ like a magic lamp or something !\n\nSo anyway, I showed up to the store again, and brought a piece of plastic with me, that can make appear out of nowhere some INSTANT credit, it says VISA CIBC �credit� card on it.\n\nAnd it worked !!!!....INSTANTLY, I could CREATE some credit/money to SPEND it :D\n\nNow, from where/who this fucking credit comes from ?....\n\nI am thinking that it comes from �ME�, with the help of some fucktards :/  , by using the LEGAL person, I happen to have in my pocket (slave), I could create CREDIT, and that person (slave) has now a debt, and since it�s MY slave, I got to make it pay, make it works, make it sweat, to BALANCE some books somewhere��.\n\nThe good news is, it�s NOT my slave, I just happen to HAVE it, because its owner delivered it to me, so I can USE it, and its OWNER is SURETY for it, and the OWNER gave me the right to the person�s surety, well, that�s what is written :/\n\nSo I am at a point where I KNOW I can use that surety to balance VISA CIBC�s books��I can�t see WHY I couldn�t do it, that�s what a slave is suppose to do anyway, work for its MASTER, and make him eat.\n\nI got to be the MASTER, unless someone says otherwise ? :/ , I know where is surety, so I am thinking of explaining all this to Bank of Canada, and instruct them to balance VISA CIBC�s books.\n\nI guess all these RECEIPTS will be helpful, they seems to be the VALUE of these CREDITS�.for example, one of these receipts says $312.48 on it, it dosen�t say -$312.48, or minus $312.48, but $312.48 :/ , so that must be the VALUE itself ?\n\nI am NOT sure about the mechanics on DOING this with Bank of Canada, should I just ACCEPT these receipts and write the account number on them and photo copy them and send the ORIGINAL to bank of Canada ?\n\nShould I itemized them one by one on a account statement, with a bottom portion called REMITTANCE, and create a Completed Bill of Exchange ?\n\nI am NOT sure about this�..so here�s the thread :D\n\nOh, and this $312.48 was all food :) no fucking luxury shit, strictly food and soap :D ....\"consumer's shit\"\n\nBut again, if this is TRUE, no one would really have to WORK ? :-o\n\nThe legal definition of the word WORK is preatty straight forward, check it out !!! :)\n\nThat could cause some crazy shit out there !!!!!\n\nThat seems to good to be true :( oh well !!!",
