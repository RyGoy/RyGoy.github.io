   "message": "Todd Keller I've never used debt notes to pay off a credit card ACCOUNT. I use money of ACCOUNT. \n\nWhen I get the CC ACCOUNT STATEMENT for the next month, there's always a line that says \"PAYMENTS AND OTHER CREDITS\" just under the line with the previous amount owed and the balance is always ZERO. At this point, the PERSON has honoured the OBLIGATION to pay off her PRIVATE DEBTS. That is a WRITTEN CONFIRMATION that they RECEIVED a PAYMENT. I guess that can be considered a RECEIPT ?\n\nAs been said, the VERY LAST THING I want is to have a PERSON with a bad CREDIT score. Even if it's their game and all... When you play a game, you gotta play by the rules... \n\nUltimately, in that game, the CREDIT score doesn't prove if your PERSON is rich or poor, it proves that you THE MAN who ADMINISTRATES that person have been keeping shit tight and are a GOOD ADMINISTRATOR / CREDITOR for the PERSON SLAVE / DEBTOR.\n\nI know LOTS of guys who's PERSONS have always been MILLIONNAIRES, and they still used a credit card from a very young age ONLY (or maybe not only and that's the reason their PERSONS are MILLIONNAIRES) to keep a CREDIT RECORD, just in case I always guessed...\n\nNow, If I were to ask the CC Company for a formal RECEPT for ALL THE PAYMENTS they got from the PERSON over the PAST, say, 5 YEARS, you think they wouldn't produce it ? \nI guess I'll have to ask :D",
