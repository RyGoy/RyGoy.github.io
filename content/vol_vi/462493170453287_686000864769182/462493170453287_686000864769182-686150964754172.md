   "message": "The problem I see with asking the credit card company to accept the bill of exchange is not only they have no obligation to keep your person as a customer, but they could also affect that person's credit score... That's why I'd rather use money of account to pay off those debts, remain in honour and make sure they ABSOLUTELY wanna keep doing business with my person and even INCREASE the person's credit limit, then ask for a receipt / proof of payment, and process that through the Bank of Canada...",
