   "message": "When a PERSON contracts a loan, and money is created with the PROMISSORY NOTE SECURITY, the LAW makes it clear that any object or document received (by the bank) as evidence or guarantee for the obligation (to pay the amount + interests) of the borrower must be returned once he fulfills his obligations... Keeping it, hiding it, altering it, etc is a CRIMINAL OFFENSE.\n\nThey DONT WANT / REFUSE / CANNOT return that fuckin contract back. They LEGALLY owe it to WB and sure as fuck soon or later WB is gonna get what is owed.\n\nSomehow, there MUST BE something similar somewhere that relates to these piece of shit CREDIT CARD scams and I now WANNA KNOW what it is they are NOT TELLING us.\n\nI'm not a fuckin slave and the money created by MY time x energy x knowledge / my signature and/or PIN when I use their POS card, cant exist without ME. And did I say I'm not a fuckin slave ?\nHe who creates something OWNS that thing..?",
