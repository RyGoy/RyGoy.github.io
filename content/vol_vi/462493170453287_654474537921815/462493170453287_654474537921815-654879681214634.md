   "message": "The paperwork including the PERSON in question was sent to the court clerk 5 days before the hearing. My friend in question was chilling elsewhere and i went to the courthouse to see if his case was listed. I enquired about the case and after 2 hours or so in the public gallery  i was trespassed upon by a garda and asked what interest i had in that particular case, then he arrested me for not identifying myself, what a joke, these idiots are out of control.
