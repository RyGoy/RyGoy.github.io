   "message": "I thought this group  was supposed to be more supportive.   Public record  shows your intent to what ever action or document you are recording.  \"Record\" to register to enroll to write or enter in a book or on parchment for the purpose of preserving authentic or correct evidence of a thing 2. To imprint deeply on the mind or memory.  Making your record supports your claim in anything you do, it is a powerful tool.  When they refuse to record have a document already prepared with a witness ( by two or three witnesses a thing is done) and record their failure to file, ask them to sign your doc, they wont, then record their refusal to sign.  Regardless of if you get anything recorded into public record,  you have made your record personally and as long as it is properly witnessed it can be admissible as evidence.",
