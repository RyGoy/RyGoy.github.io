   "message": "Ok, i live in Lost Wages(las vegas, nv) and i recently made a personal affidavit declaring that im not a negotiable security and i retained all my unalienable and unalienable rights given God and supported by u.s. constitution.  I also stated  my fee schedule for public servants attempting to obtain a security interest without my expressed written consent, the fee for my forced compliance under stress, threat, and duress aka interfering with my rights is 50 g's per infraction.\ni get it notarized and then I went to public records to get it entered into record.  THEY PUT A HOLD ON IT sayin they have to review it first, they call me back later and say they REFUSE TO ENTER IT into public record and tell me i cant use it.  My question for the group is:  What would you do now?  What would be the most accurate techniques for combating their censorship of my rights?(I believe I should be able to charge them for contracting with me just as they charge for contracting with them!  Any good advice would be greatly appreciated, sincerely javier)",
