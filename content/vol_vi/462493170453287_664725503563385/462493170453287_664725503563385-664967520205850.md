When you use this service, you are making a public record. Once they receive the docs, it's over.\n\nThe reason they can \"decide\" what can be filed, or not, there is because IT'S NOT YOUR FUCKING COURT. It not for YOU, it's not there to defend your rights, or any of that romantic shit you have heard in movies, and free-dumb seminars. It's a SLAVERY business where accounting, and surety are dealt with, and a place to keep the slaves \"accountable\" for there actions and/or inaction. You have a WRONG idea of what courts are. It's a CLUB, and YOU/US are not part of it. Got that?\n\nIt would seem that doing what you are attempting to do would create JOINDER by pleading papers to the court, using THEIR property (the Legal Name) and claiming LEGAL rights, and all that free-dumb shit. If you ask to be one of the club, you WILL be treated as if you were from the club.\n\nThere is no \"god\", no unalienable \"rights\", no \"constitution\", it's ALL there for THEM, not for you/us.\n\nWhy are you attempting the affidavit thing? What is it that you are trying to achieve?",
