   "message": "A friend of mine gave me the idea, plus other material I read on this site, and to me logic says if all law is contract then why not prepare ahead of time??  Why not have ur own contract ready n serve them at same time they offer to contract wit u?  Ive got a few victimless crimes im goin thru rite now and im searching for answers.  Ways to attack them if necessary.  I dont consent here is my counter offer?  U dont like? Ok I dont like urs either, how bout u and I do buisness with other people then?",
