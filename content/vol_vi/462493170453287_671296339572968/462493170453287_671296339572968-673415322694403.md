It's CRIMINAL to let strangers decide how much VALUE your time is worth, without your consent. They have a MONOPOLY.\n\nThat is part of the slavery programing. Men, and women have LOST any sense of self worth, self VALUE. They believe \"entities\" or \"experts\" should decide how much VALUE their time is worth. That it's bullshit.",
