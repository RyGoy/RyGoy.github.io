   "message": "Mackximus- does \"This (promissory)Note is Legal Tender\" not represent DEBT? Scott always says this is all about surety, and, ACCOUNTING. In accounting, there is a ledger. That ledger has a debit side, and a CREDIT side. So if \"This (promissory)Note Is Legal Tender\" represents debt, then by simple logic, wouldnt a RECEIPT, that Scott has already said equals \"PROOF-OF-TITLE,\" represent the CREDIT in this equation?  My aunt likes to shop at 'Winners' btw alot, and has amassed quite a number of 'credit-slips' as a  result of bringing stuff back for return. I am assuming that a credit-slip from Winners would be considered as a \"valuable security\" too?",
