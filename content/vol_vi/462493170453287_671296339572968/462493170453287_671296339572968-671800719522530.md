   "message": "I just got an idea.  If my corporation gets a CONTRACT for say a $30,000 installation, upon execution, it has the RIGHT to lien the property based on the CONTRACT (I think its called a MECHANICS LIEN...).  So, wouldn't we be able to lien BEFORE generating an INVOICE to protect our interests in an established CONTRACT?  Does this make sense?",
