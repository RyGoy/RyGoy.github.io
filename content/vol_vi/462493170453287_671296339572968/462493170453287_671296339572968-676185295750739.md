   "message": "Seriously, the Bills of Exchange Act seemed like a bunch of gibberish until I watched the video 3 or 4 times, did a bunch of study & started to comprehend what was hidden in plain sight...\n\nIt's a paradigm shift and it continues to blow my mind that it's all there in front of us, once we know how to use it.\n\nNow I get pissed off when people (read Freedumbers) claim they ARE the person, that it's theirs and that the gubbmint is stealing from THEM...fraudsters.",
