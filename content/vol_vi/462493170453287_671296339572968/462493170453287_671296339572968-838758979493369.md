   "message": "In the scenario I was asking about, the lien would be resulting from an unpaid invoice.\n\nThe unpaid invoice stems from an unresolved claim for the original promissory note not being returned when the mortgage was discharged and closed.\n\nSo, although it is different from a \"Lien-the-name\" based question, I don't think it would change the answers to anything I've asked.\n:)",
