   "message": "6 years ago I had a $55000 loan at a credit Union... I sent them a letter saying I'll gladly pay if you can provide me the original document signed by me and the banker... Prove I'm the debtor... Prove you're at a loss if no money gets deposited into loan. Loan got discharged just last year v no letters back... No phone calls and kept my car",
