   "message": "Lets say PIERRE DAOUST goes to the grocery store to buy some food, and decides to PAY with MONEY OF ACCOUNT (credit card)\n\nIt is OBVIOUSLY the SOLE authorized Administrator for PIERRE DAOUST that will have to do this, so, as a good administrator, I will keep the receipts for this.\n\nBut �legally�, who bought these consumable products ?\nPIERRE DAOUST did, and PIERRE DAOUST has a SURETY at a bank, which happen to be Bank of Canada�.\n\nSo me, as a good administrator, what prevents me to DRAW a check to PIERRE DAOUST (beneficiary), from PIERRE DAOUST�s account at Bank of Canada, which account, happens to have an UNLIMITED credit limit ?\n\nThis seems to be pure ACCOUNTING :D\n\n:D",
