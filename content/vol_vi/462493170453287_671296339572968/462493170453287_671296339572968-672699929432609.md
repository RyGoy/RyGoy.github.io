   "message": "Ok, now that the tumbleweeds have left the building... :D\n\nLet's get back to the Remittance vs. Cheque resemblance. Does this part of the Bills of Exchange Act have something to do with that?:\n\n47. Where a bill is drawn or endorsed by any infant, minor or CORPORATION having no capacity or power to incur liability on a bill, the drawing or endorsement entitles the holder to receive payment of the bill and to enforce it against any other party thereto.\n\nSo as say, utility companies are operating in bankruptcy, they do not have the power to incur liability on a bill? Would that be correct?",
