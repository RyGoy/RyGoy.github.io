   "message": "CHRIS is the slave, which is the full, and sole responsibility of the owner. The owner is not Chris, the Man. Chris can only administrate for the owner. Chris is NOT the slave. Why is Chris, the Man, paying for stuff for CHRIS, the slave? :/\n\nSince it's THEIR system, and it's not Chris's fault, many of those expenses for CHRIS, may be fairly returned to the real creditor, Chris the Man. He is the one to put his TIME to pay for all that stuff for CHRIS. And we know Chris is NOT a slave.  \n\nWith the RECEIPTS, and some CONSIDERATION, the Federal Reserve Bank, in our case, may act as the drawee for a Bill of Exchange that the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for CHRIS will create, and present to the Federal Reserve Bank, since CHRIS is also payee, and it's the OBLIGATION of the payee (it's NOT payee, but BENEFICIARY, please not this correction) to present this to the the bank that holds the surety. And all this it's not Chris's fault! :D\n\nPete Daoust, is this correct ?",
