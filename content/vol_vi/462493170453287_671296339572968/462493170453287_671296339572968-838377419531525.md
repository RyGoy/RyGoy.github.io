   "message": "Is a lien a \"negotiable instrument\" ?\n\nThe definition of \"negotiable instrument\" in the financial administration act finishes with ...\"and any other similar instrument\"\n\nI am trying to connect some dots here myself. I have an unpaid invoice, that I expect will soon get to the lien stage. I am wondering if it will itself become a negotiable instrument. If it is, then it is money right? I could then give it away to a charitible non-profit organization and get a tax reciept correct? I could then have the accountant do the tax return for the person I administrate and there would be a large refund there that I could do something constructive with?\n\nAm I way off here?",
