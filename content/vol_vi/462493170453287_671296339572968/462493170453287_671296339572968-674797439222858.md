   "message": "Tell them, they make a claim based on stuff you dont understand, they have to clarify it so that you can understand, because as far as you are concerned, you honoured all your obligations, did nothing illegal or unlawful, and unless they return all the coupons/slips/vouchers they are considered to be paid.\n\nIf they don't answer your questions, you have reasons to believe they recognise they act illegally. Tell them that's their last chance to answer and you graciously give them 10 days to prove the contrary, then extra fees apply and the minister of justice will be informed, and the Suretï¿½ du Quebec as well because it seems like they try to defraud the PERSON, maybe even trying to cash in twice on the SURETY for the *same* debt which has been administrated and/or (should already be) paid...\n\nAnd make sure your invoice is bold, you have no time to waste, especially with people who give you the impression they are trying to defraud PIERRE DAOUST.\n\nMake it clear and final. Use the word PREREMPTORY. Then you should have more than everything to get an ex parte order ?\n\nNever been there, so you tell me if I'm totally outtawack or something...",
