   "message": "I get it as \"getting the payment is now under the responsibility of Hydro\" since you have done everything you legally had to do ... So they now have to honour their legal obligations too... They are responsible for it. They are SURETY for the matter of getting their payment. The music's still playing.\n\nYou served the ball back to them. You have honoured your responsibilities you are not responsible for the rest. If THEY fuckaround with this, THEY are the only ones responsible....\n\nEnglish and legalese aint my first languages, but it seems that :\nYou understand facts, laws, etc.\nYou undertake actions, procedures, etc.\n\nWhen you underSTAND, you are responsible.\nWhen you underTAKE, you are responsible.\nBeing responsible = SURETY.",
