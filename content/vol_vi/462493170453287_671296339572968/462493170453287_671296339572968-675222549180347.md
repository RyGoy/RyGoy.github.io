   "message": "I picture them standing in front of a cracked and leaking dam with a finger stuck in a hole and Pete on the other side biting that finger. I wonder how many customers of hydro Quebec are trying this at the moment? All the vouchers that you have returned in honor each month is being held as a loss to them if they never sent to bank of Canada in some sort of timely manner, (this I can only speculate.) They can't stop you from biting the finger for that is illegal, so all they have is slow monthly nagging for you and everyone else brave enough to take it this far and not give a fuck. They still make enough off other customers to cover you and the other administrators, but you are cutting into the bottom line of profits too. Higher rates to balance? Only a PERSON would care!",
