   "message": "Mackximus Minimus you are totally right, but they WILL want to negotiate on what it's worth anyways. \n\nYou cannot come here and tell me your time is more valuable than mine if we were both to accomplish the same task in the same amount of time...\n\nIf you say \"Hey I'm gonna mow your lawn for 1000$/hour\" and they have a guy already doing it for 20$, they won't accept your offer...\n\nWhat can you do for me which is worth 1000$/hour ? Then we can talk. Because if your time is worth 1000$, go work for someone else, load up that wallet and come back when you can pay me ;)\n\nChip, I'd NOTIFY them of what I wish to do, but I couldn't INSTRUCT them on doing something which I don't know yet what the proper procedure is... So I'd tell them that I wish they disclose the complete proper procedure or tell me where I can find all that info or prove me it cannot be done...",
