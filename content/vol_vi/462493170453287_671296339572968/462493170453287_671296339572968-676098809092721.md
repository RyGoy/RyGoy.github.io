   "message": "For my gas I sent the original first completed bill of exchange to the Bank of Canada and a copy to the gas company. The idea was to have bank of canada aware that it was accepted by me, and to let me know if there were any issues on their part. No response so they had no issue. The completed bills of exchange after that, the original was sent to the gas company ....no response from them other then threats lol \n\nI would think CRA will just discharge the debt, without the bank of canada being involved, but I don't know that for sure, I'm still learning through experience here lol",
