   "message": "Re: Chip Douglas:  And ultimately- a \"valuable security\" would need to eventually be 'redeemed,' \n\nThe holder may redeem it, sell it to another party for a percentage of its face value (negotiate its value with a third party), gift it to a third party, deposit it as an asset into a corporation (adding to the paper value of the company), deposit it into a trust as a trust asset....\n\nUltimately, the holder in due course may claim the value, or do what we all used to do up until reading this thread:  burn it, shred it or bin it in which case the value would not be redeemed.",
