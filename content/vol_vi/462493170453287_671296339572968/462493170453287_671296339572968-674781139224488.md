   "message": "I would send them copies of all communications with highlight on all questions they never answered, and ask them all again, saying you have reasons to believe they read the law, understand the law, deliberately act illegally, ask them if there's an article which mentions the law doesnt apply to them... You have reasons to believe there aint any, i guess they already got your fee schedule, so invoice ? And maybe tell them you will copy the minister of justice as a witness if they refuse to respond, as this seems like fraud and/or extortion to you...",
