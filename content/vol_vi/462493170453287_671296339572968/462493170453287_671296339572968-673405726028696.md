   "message": "Will, I have a very specific case. \n\nIt's a private debt with a bank. Party A is the Person. Party B is the bank.  Party A takes a loan from Party B, and promise to pay back in X of money, in X amount of time. \n\nSome years later Party A gets into a financial hardship, and cannot continue making payments to Party B. Party B can only ascertain that Party A owes some money. Party B CANNOT obligate party A to pay in a one and only specific way, that would be ILLEGAL. There was no prior negotiation about how Party A would get the money to pay Party B. There was no negotiation about how much VALUE does Party's A TIME was/is worth.\n\nSince TIME is MONEY, Party A makes Party B an offer to settle the accounting with TIME, which is MONEY. Isn't MONEY also just a measurement of our time? But by exchanging our time for a currency, we LOOSE CONTROL of how much VALUE our time is worth. They give us NO OPTIONS. And they know it.\n\nAm I the only one that can see this? :/",
