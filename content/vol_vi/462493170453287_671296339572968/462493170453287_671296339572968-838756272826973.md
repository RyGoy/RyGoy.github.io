   "message": "Did YOU create that money? Are you a trustee in its administration?\n\nThe answer is NO!\n\nYou are the lawful holder in due course of that security. Nothing more. If you BENEFIT from that DEBT IN TRANSIT, then you are DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE TENDER FOR LAW THAT MONEY PROVIDES, and ALL of its rules.\n\nSo no, you cannot alter the terms after you committed.\n\nSino General alters the terms BEFORE he signs, just like you are supposed to. I'm not sure why they get so upset when he tries to leverage the PERFECTLY LEGAL (Perfected [Two signatures and a trustee's seal]) terms in those contracts.",
