   "message": "Money is a measurement of your TIME x your EFFORTS...\n\nYou cannot be sitting on the couch, breathing/wasting air, and claiming your time is worth 1000$/h.\n\nI'll keep playing the flipside here :\nWhen you contracted that loan, you both agreed on what the PERSON's reimbursing capabilities were. That was based on the PERSON's job earnings, which is based on your TIME x your EFFORTS... So they have a pretty good idea of what your TIME is worth based on the agreements of that contract...\n\nIf you made sure to tell them upfront, HEY Here's what my time is worth, just so you know... Then they couldn't refuse or negotiate your offer...\n\nI'm pretty sure COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS aren't accounted for at a 1000$/h rate... Call the municipality and ask them, Hey how much is the guy who's mowing the grass is paid ?? And you'll get an idea of what the fine is... But I also have reasons to believe they sentence to COMMUNITY SERVICE so that it has a psychological effect over the MAN who administrated the PERSON outside their rules :)",
