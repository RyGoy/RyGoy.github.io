   "message": "nominee n. 1) a person or entity who is requested or named to act for another, such as an agent or trustee. 2) a potential successor to another's rights under a contract. Example: In a real estate purchase agreement, Bob Buyer agrees to purchase the property, but provides that title (legal ownership) will be granted to \"Bob Buyer or nominee,\" so that Buyer can sell his rights to another person before the deal closes, or because Buyer is really acting for someone else. 2) the executor proposed by a person in a will is a nominee until officially appointed by the judge after the testator (will writer) has died, and the will is submitted for probate (administration of the estate). 3) a person chosen by convention, petition or primary election to be a candidate for public office. (See: executor, agent)",
