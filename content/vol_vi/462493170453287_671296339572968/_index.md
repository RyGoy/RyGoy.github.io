   "message": "David Vilaca\n\nOK�.Let�s INVOICE :P\nThe first thing I need to do, when I decide to CLAIM money from another, it�s to NOTIFY them on WHY I claim. This is usually done by sending a Notice.\n\nExample: Notice of Breach of Trust.\nYou did that, you were not suppose to do that, so now you�ve stripped me from this and that RIGHT, and I �CLAIM� this amount of MONEY for that stripped right, and that amount for this specific one, and blablabla�.if you don�t restore this, I want that�and so on�..\n\nYou give them X amount of days to CONTEST what you think you can CLAIM�you tell them if they don�t contest, an INVOICE will show up in their mailbox.\n\nThen, you proceed with the INVOICE, check the legal definition of INVOICE, and create one�..you need to specify the Payment-Terms: like due upon receipt, ot net-10-days, or whatever you feel like�.\n\n1). You send that invoice.\n\n2). If you don�t receive payment according to the terms, you send an account statement, written PAST DUE on it, in RED.\n\n3). If you don�t receive payment, you send a NOTICE, saying you have NOT received payment, and you give them 3 days to pay.\n\n4). If you don�t receive payment, you send a FINAL Notice saying, Hey fuck, what the fuck is going on ?, and give them another 3 days.\n\n5). If you don�t receive payment, you send a Notice of Default, saying Be advised, since you haven't responded to my CLAIM, and haven't challenged my invoice, we have no other choice than to send you this notice of default.\n\nWe are nice folks, so we will give you an extra 3 days to pay the amount claimed.\n\nIf we do not receive payment, we will follow up with the LIEN process\n\n6). If you don�t receive payment, you proceed with the LIEN.",
