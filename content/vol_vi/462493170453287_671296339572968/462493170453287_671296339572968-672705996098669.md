   "message": "When SFC Inc receives its Hydro Bill......the only option I see for SFC Inc is to cut a check...and HYDRO will cut SFC's service if SFC Inc don't PAY.\n\nThe way I get that article 47, is a MINOR and/or a CORPORATION, can't complete a bill of exchange sent by a utility company, they can't be the DRAWEE, and/or the DRAWER, and/or the BENEFICIARY.....\n\nFor a MINOR, its LEGAL guardian would have to administrate the debt, by supra protesting it......\n\nMaybe I could SUPRA PROTEST for SFC Inc as well, not too sure on that one.....\n\nThat's the way I get it, but I may be waaayyyy...in the bushes with that :D",
