   "message": "Seriously Jason Lerato, this stuff will mess with your head & everything you have ever believed (which is part of the reason why ALL belief is evil).\n\nThe deprogramming/reprogramming is a time consuming/difficult/mindblowing process...it wont be easy but it IS worth it.\n\nCut & paste posts into word, delete all the fluff n trashtalk & focus on the key elements...then read & reread...especially the stuff Scott mentions...the more cryptic it seems & the more it seems to make no sense at this point in time, the more profound it usually is...then when you have a basic handle on it, define the terms, ALL of them.\n\nThen as your comprehension improves, go back over old posts again & you'll have leaps in understanding on concepts that made no sense before, things like civil death/liens/trusts/corporations & especially money...and then you'll comprehend the 2 key principles:\n\n1.  Scott is ALWAYS right\n2.  It's ALL about accounting & surety.\n\nThen you'll get angry at the lies n bullshit you've been fed, and then you'll  begin to learn how to use the system as it was designed (and never taught)...\n\nAnd then you'll become a belligerent cantankerous fucker like the rest of us :D",
