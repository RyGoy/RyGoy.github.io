   "message": "This all reminds me; a couple years ago, I was walking out of a grocery-store, there were some young girls asking for donations for their skating-club. Except, they weren't asking for 'money.' They were asking for people as they walked by, if they could have their RECEIPTS they just got from grocery-shopping. I stopped dead in my tracks as soon as I heard what they were asking for, gave them my receipt, and have always wondered since, what was the purpose of them asking for the 'RECEIPT' of all things... :/",
