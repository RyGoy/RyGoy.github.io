   "message": "I just read that whole article.  There are some things in there we KNOW to be true:\n\n\"Birth certificates\nThere are three main beliefs about birth certificates in freeman mythology:\nThe government uses them to create your strawman and legal person to which all your legal responsibilities, debts and liabilities belong.[31][24]\nAs a form of registration, they transfer ownership of an individual to the state. This is what allows the state to seize your children if you don't play by their rules.[31]\nThey are financial instruments or birth-tracking bonds (a.k.a. live birth bonds) that are sold by the government and then traded on the sea of international commerce, using you as security (an idea taken from the redemption movement).\"\n\n\"Freemen claim the government secures the value of its fiat currency using its own citizens' birth certificate \"bonds.\"\"",
