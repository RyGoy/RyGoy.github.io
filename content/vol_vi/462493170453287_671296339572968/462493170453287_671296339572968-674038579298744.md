   "message": "Considering the Bills of Exchange Act says basically that the signature is the value, and that the definition they give for value is \"valuable consideration,\" then, if you 'paid' for something with \"This Note Is Legal Tender,\" and you get a RECEIPT for doing so, and RECEIPT=PROOF-OF-TITLE.....wouldnt the RECEIPT in a way act as PROOF that the vendor got 'paid,' but, that i used \"This Note Is Legal Tender\" in order to do it instead of my SIGNATURE as we are supposed to do, and having the RECEIPT may mean that the ACCOUNTING on this PURCHASE still needs to be adjusted for?",
