   "message": "From a Christian Walters paper:\n\n\"If you didn�t express it to be a trust from the beginning, here it was a trust because there is no money, and everything has to be a trust. When you go to the grocery store to buy groceries you think you are paying for something with Federal Reserve Notes, and that is just your purchase, you aren�t purchasing anything. You are forming a trust. The same way at the gas station when you buy gasoline for your car. You aren�t buying gas, you are forming a trust. Everything today has to be a trust. We are forming hundreds of trusts a day probably in some cases.\"\n\nAnd the RECEIPT is the evidence of the transfer of the corpus!  Your TIME!  :-D",
