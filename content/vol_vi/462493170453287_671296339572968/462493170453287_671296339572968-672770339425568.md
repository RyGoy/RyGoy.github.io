   "message": "Let�s say Chris the MAN went to the grocery store and got a RECEIPT for goods, that RECEIPT is a proof of DISBURSEMENT in an ACCOUNT in which EVERY SINGLE FUCKIN CENT was DEPOSITED in exchange for Chris the MAN�s time sweat and blood. \n\nThat RECEIPT is a VALUABLE SECURITY.\nIts VALUE is the AMOUNT which it PROVES has been paid.\n\nLet's say the RECEIPT has a $100 VALUE.\nIf you can PROVE CHRIS EVAN has a VALUE of $100, then CHRIS EVAN�s SURETY must be AT LEAST $100, right ?\n\nLet�s say CHRIS EVAN used $100 of MONEY OF ACCOUNT which was DISBURSED from his checking ACCOUNT�\n\nChris the MAN is the one who worked his ass, time sweat and blood, to give CHRIS EVAN that value.\nChris the MAN is the Sole Authorized Administrator for CHRIS EVAN.\nChris the MAN has the right to CHRIS EVAN�s SURETY.\nWhat�s Chris the MAN gonna do ? Act like a slave ?? Why would he do that ?\n\nYou are the creditor. Without you, there's no MONEY.\nThe Birth Certificate is an UNLIMITED CREDIT LIMIT.\nYour signature gives VALUE to ANYTHING you sign. \nYou can GIVE VALUE and you can CREATE MONEY !\n\nFrom an administrative point of view, it only seems like a logical decision to send that VALUABLE SECURITY over to CHRIS EVAN�s SURETY, which isn't you, so it can do what it�s supposed to do !\n\nNow the scary part : It all seems to make sense�\n\nAnd you know what they say : ALWAYS KEEP THE RECEIPT :p\n\nThe only thing I don't get is when Pete Daoust says �CASH as a beneficiary�..?",
