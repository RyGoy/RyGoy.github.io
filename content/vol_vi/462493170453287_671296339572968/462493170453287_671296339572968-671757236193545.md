Create a Bill of Exchange, the SAME way HYDRO-QUEBEC creates theirs....with PIERRE DAOUST as a drawer, \"CASH\" as a beneficiary, and Bank of Canada as the Drawee....\n\n4). Complete that Bill of Exchange, to turn it into a check.\n\n5). Send that that check to Bank of Canada, with the receipt, with some CONSIDERATION (a certified copy of PIERRE DAOUST's birth certificate.)\n\n6). INSTRUCT Bank of Canada to send payment to the order of \"CASH\", at PIERRE DAOUST's legal address.\n\n:D (Thinking out loud !! ) but it completely makes sense in my brain ! :D",
