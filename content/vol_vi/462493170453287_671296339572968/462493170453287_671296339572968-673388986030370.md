But, fortunately, NO ONE EVER AGAIN will tell ME how much my time is VALUED or worth.�\n\nWell, from a contract pt of view, I think the value of your time would have to be established up front in order to be recognized as such under that specific contract...\n\nYou are not a slave, but the other party in a contract isn't your slave neither... Forcing the other party to take a LOSS based on terms they never agreed to sounds like you are the one in dishonour...",
