If I was a bit trigger happy, please forgive me! \n\nBut I was trying to make a point, that even lying a little bit, it's part of the flaws that we present as a programed society, and must always deal saying the truth. And it pisses me off to see liars not getting called to account. \n\nOnce again, sorry for your butthurtness, please forgive me! :P",
