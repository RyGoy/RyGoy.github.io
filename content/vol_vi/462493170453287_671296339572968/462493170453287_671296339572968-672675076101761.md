It's not his fault. :D\n\n\"The government uses them to create your strawman and legal person to which all your legal responsibilities, debts and liabilities belong.\"\n\nNo. They simply made a SURETY BOND which you are the HOLDER of...\n\n...and FUCKING \"STRAWMAN\"! Seriously! Strawman=FREE-DUMB SHIT!\n\n\"As a form of registration, they transfer ownership of an individual to the state. This is what allows the state to seize your children if you don't play by their rules.\" \n\nNO. Only the CHILD is. Once adulthood is attained, you USE the PERSON. I recommend ADMINISTRATION... again,... ask Pete.\n\n\"They are financial instruments or birth-tracking bonds (a.k.a. live birth bonds) that are sold by the government and then traded on the sea of international commerce, using you as security (an idea taken from the redemption movement).\"\n\nWHAT? WTF is a \"live birth bond\"?\n\nShow me the LEGAL RULE supporting that claim! If it's a BOND, there MUST be LAW supporting it. LEGAL=ACCOUNTING AND SURETY. Those who say otherwise ARE LYING TO YOU and MEAN YOU HARM.",
