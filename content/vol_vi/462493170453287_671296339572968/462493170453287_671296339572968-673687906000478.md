   "message": "I see what you are saying, Stuart. The third option looks like I would need a RECEIPT to justify, in order to offer the bank's surety as consideration for that cheque.\n\nBut please tell me I am wrong, Scott Duncan or Pete Daoust, I have never seen a contract that obligates to repay it in an specific form of payment. :( I thinks it's suggested. For example, if there is banks that tells you that they only accept a bank manager check's to settle the account, I think that is illegal. There is something to this whole thing, I cannot still put my finger on it completely. :/\n\nPete, why are you answering the to the  \"tits guy\", and ignoring me ? Hahaha! :P",
