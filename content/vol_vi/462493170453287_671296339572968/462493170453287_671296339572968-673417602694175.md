   "message": "No I'm not defending THEIR fraudulent system. You BOTH agreed to SPECIFIED terms and conditions when you contracted together !\n\nI'm just defending the basics of what contracts are for. You are dealing with a bank, I'm dealing with clients and suppliers. \n\nAre you saying if we agree on the value of what is to be exchanged, you can come up and force me to accept something I didn't agree with before you have fulfilled your obligations ?\n\nYou BOTH agreed on the repaying capabilities of your PERSON.\nIf the PERSON CAN NOT possibly repay, and it's an EMERGENCY, used the SURETY ? Or expose them if they can't give back the promissory note !\n\nI know what I'm worth. \nYou know you know what you are worth.\nBut my PERSON also has the right NOT TO CONTRACT with yours if the terms aren't agreed to !",
