   "message": "I have a question for Admiral Scott Duncan, or Captain Pete. \n\nIn a private debt, if my person has no access to any form of \"payment\" or \"monies\", may the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR make an offer to settle the account by using his/her TIME as the only thing of VALUE he/she posses? \n\nLet's say my person has a private debt with a bank. My person is broke. It/he cannot keep my end of the bargain. Now my person owes the bank $20,000.00 May I offer my time, at an hourly rate, to settle the account? \n\n\"Dear Vampire's Bank:\n\nMy person does not have any money, nor will it have access to money any time soon. Fortunately for us, I have something of VALUE to offer: my time!\n\nSo, I may offer my TIME at a rate of $1,000 an hour, to settle the debt of my person. I am ready to go clean, or throw the garbage out. Let me know when can I start settling the account.\n\nSOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for ME\"\n\n:/ ?",
