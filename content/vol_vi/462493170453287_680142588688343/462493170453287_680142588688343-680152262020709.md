   "message": "Mmmmmm... Can you PROVE the money is not yours ?\nOr can you PROVE that under marriage, a female person becomes property of the male PERSON and - I guess - all her property becomes his ?\n\nOn a side note... Why do all you guys have accounts and/or credit and/or loans and/or whatever in both names ? See, I never knew you could be victim of whatever bullshit another party claims on your partner, but I always thought I'd make it clear :\nI'll never get into marriage\nI'll never buy a house under 2 names\nI'll never buy a car or furniture or whatever shit with a \"shared responsibility\"...\n\n:( \n\nAnd we know \"money\" isnt safe in a bank. I never liked to let others get control of whats mine... \nSay what you want, if the system comes crashing down, you'll need cash. Even if it's technically worth nothing, the average idiots will, after a few days, trust nothing but cash, because that's all they've ever known and cash will still be valuable... So keep the minimum you NEED in a bank account but store enough outside a bank so that if page 144-145 of last year's Flaherty's budget comes effective, you're not fucked...",
