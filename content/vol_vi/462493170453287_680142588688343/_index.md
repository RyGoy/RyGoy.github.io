   "message": "My person has a bank account with my boyfriend's person. When they froze my bank accounts last year, they emptied the small balance of 600$ that was in one of them and froze the rest of them. \n\nEven the one that is shared with another person.\n\nThere was a balance of � 750$ in that shared bank account that they are leaving there except for the administration fees that are deducted every month. \n\nSo my boyfriend tried telling them that it was his money not JANICK's (he's still learning!) So the Bank Director said that if the money wasn't JANICK's she just had to write to REVENUE QU�BEC to let them now  and to ask to release the money to the other partie.\n\nSo this is what I wrote:\n\nVendredi le 25 avril 2014\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED/WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n\nAGENCE DU REVENU DU QU�BEC\na/s  M�lissa Corriveau\n4, place-Laval, bureau 500\nSecteur L462P1\nLaval, QC   H7N 5Y3\n\nN� N.E.Q. : 226xxxxxxx\nN� de r�f�rence: 101xxxxx\n\nREGISTERED MAIL: RN 001 175 XXX CA\n\nNOTICE OF CLAIM\n\nBonjour Mme Corriveau.\n\nThe accounts under the name JANICK PAQUETTE, who is the person I administrate with the SIN 26x xxx xxx �...., have been frozen.\n\nThe funds from (account number) at BMO in Mont-Tremblant, is a joint account under the names (both person's names)\n\nThe funds in that account belongd to the person (other person's name) and the funds are not accessible since that time.\n\nI am advising you to unfreeze the total amount of this account so it can be available to the person (other parties name).\n\nPlease act accordingly !\n\nRegards !\n\nAuthorised by: The Sole Authorised Administrator for the person JANICK PAQUETTE 26x xxx xxx / �..\n\naddress of the person here.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nI never got a response and the account is still frozen!\n\nSo what's an Administrator to do? :/",
