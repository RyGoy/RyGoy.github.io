   "message": "I am using my seal to give authority to my communications, and stopped signing crap. Surety, and signing stuff go hand in hand, so avoid using it, and if I use it, I qualify the signature as the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR.\n\nGail Marie,  Cara Small, and the rest, the other day we drafted an affirmation of the truth. \n\nI will include a notarized copy of that sucker in all communications, if I have to. I will send them PROOF of who is surety, under affirmation. That way, from the beginning, they will know who I am, and who I am not. There is no discussion that I am the administrator, and that I am not liable for all those public debts. \n\nWe know the power of affirmations and/or affidavits in the LEGAL world! :D",
