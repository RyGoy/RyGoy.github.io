   "message": "The lawyers for CIBC used the same mumbo jumbo with me over a credit card debt they bought off of Citibank  i told the legal eagle that when they purchased that debt they also purchased the conditional offer i made to Citi and thus no one has ever addressed it. Not only that i called and recorded several conversations with 2 of the last collection agencies  they hired to recover the debt I asked them specific questions like have you ever validated the debt  they replied no even after they were notified they were being recorded The lawyer sent a reply to my offer quoting meads vs meads and told me not to send any more replies to him",
