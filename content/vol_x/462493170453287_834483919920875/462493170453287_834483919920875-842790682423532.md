   "message": "Statistically speaking what has the greater chance of return on investment - buying a lottery ticket or donating money to Robert Menard?  I'll help you out with some statistics: \n\nThe odds of winning the lottery are between 1 in 24,000,000 and 1 in 28,000,000.  The odds of getting attacked and killed by a shark are 1 in 3,748,067. In a lifetime, you are more likely to die from fireworks (1 in 340,733), lightning (1 in 79,746), drowning (1 in 1,134), a car accident (1 in 84), stroke (1 in 24), or heart disease (1 in 5).\n\nYes, it's lottery ticket.  100% of the time you receive a lovely printed piece of paper as a memento of your inherent and crippling stupidity.",
