   "message": "Does \"streamlining\" court system mean compromising justice? YES (if you BELIEVE justice ever existed)...and that's exactly the INTENT. They aren't following their own rules and do not give a fuck! I mentioned that this has already happened in Peel Region in a previous post about Rocco Galati's case against the Bank of Canada.\n\n�You are no longer innocent until proven guilty as guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, ... You will go before a municipal employee, who is clearly going to be biased. You will make your argument not on your innocence or guilt, you will make your argument on how much penalty you will pay, because you are already guilty,� ... an appeal will also be heard by a municipal employee. \n\nI received two of these penalty notices, one in January and the other in February. Both were parking related. After the agent cancelled both of them I asked the agent how presuming someone is guilty is constitutional and his response was \"York Region has been doing this for the past 7 years\" :o Well I guess that makes it alright then?",
