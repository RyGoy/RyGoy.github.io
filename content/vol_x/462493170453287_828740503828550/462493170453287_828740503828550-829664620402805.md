   "message": "I meant to comment on this earlier, but honestly thought the thread was too retarded to survive.\n\nSince there are no women posting, and I am not anatomically equipped with a penis (despite prevailing opinion), I am really the only one qualified to comment.  There are a few things I would like to mention.  \n\nThe first is that most of these team sports are all about male machismo - no one wants to see, or will pay for, a bunch of women in padded uniforms duking it out on a playing field.  This excludes the \"sports\" depicted herein, or probably anything involving girl-on-girl action, nudity, mud or jello.  On the playing field, manly male participants compete for the adulation of onlooking jock-wannabes who drink excessively and swear like drunken sailors.  Good or bad, that has always been part of the culture.  Let us not forget as well that these fantasy contests, win or lose, generate a huge amount of revenue.  I'm not saying women can't, or don't, appreciate these events.  It is fair to say, though, that most women rarely get a metaphorical hard-on when someone offers them tickets to \"the game\".\n\nTime was that a retired player would often transition to a sports reporting career.  In possession of knowledge, experience and a reputation in the industry, this was usually a good fit.  Excelling at running, catching a ball, or blocking someone's way, is not always synonymous with intelligence or education.  Hence, statistically speaking, some dumb jocks may have ended up being successful reporters.  If someone with the demonstrable IQ of a soap dish can transition to sports reporting who difficult can it be?\n\nEnter women reporters.  Do they play the sport, have they studied it, do they know the culture?  Frankly I don't know.  I do know that in the absence of equally successful women's leagues, most women can't really understand the \"sports experience\" - the early childhood playing, dreams of a sporting career, and finally the symbiotic transference to adrenalin-soaked fan-Dom in support of other, more \"qualified\" men.  In my opinion women reporters entering a male-dominated arena should expect the same treatment as any other qualified man.  If they want to be treated as though they are reporting on a tea party, they should lobby hard for this assignment.  Otherwise they should do their homework, and be able to take it like a man.\n\nAs far as I know there is no such thing as verbal sexual assault.  It offends me that anyone would even think about making this a thing.  Actual rape is completely different; this crap should not even be in the same category.\n\nIf you want to be a women in a male-dominated career, learn to take it like a jock.  If and when a male or female reporter is sexually assaulted interviewing a bunch of drunken sports idiots in a public forum, then I'll get behind the issue.  Until then why not invest in something useful like a cool t-shirt that says, �FHRITP�?",
