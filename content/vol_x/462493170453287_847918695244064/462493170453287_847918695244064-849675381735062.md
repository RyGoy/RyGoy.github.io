The TENDER FOR LAW that the DEBT provides, PROTECTS THE SECURED PARTY (China). It's also why they kept Hong Kong a \"LEGAL\" zone. They didn't do it because they are such nice guys!\n\"Duh, Derz No proof dat yoozing munee iz consent 2 bee guvern'd\"!\nUSING LEGAL TENDER binds you. Using MONEY does not.\nWant proof?\nTHIS NOTE - The note the words (NOTICE) is written on.\nIS LEGAL - CODES, ACTS, AND STATUTES with the force of law.\nTENDER - tender verb\nten�dered ten�der�ing \nDefinition of TENDER\ntransitive verb\n1: to make a tender of\n2: to present for acceptance : offer \"tendered my resignation\"\nintransitive verb\n: to make a bid or tender\nOrigin of TENDER\nMiddle English tendren, from Anglo-French tendre offer\nFirst Known Use: 15th century\nTHIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER = THIS NOTE IS A TENDER FOR LAW\nLEGAL TENDER IS JUST THAT!\nLEGAL=SURETY and ACCOUNTING\nLEGAL TENDER is ATTACHED to the money, and is NOT THE MONEY!\nTHERE IS YOUR PROOF.\nI swear I've pointed this out before.\nYOU didn't make the money.
