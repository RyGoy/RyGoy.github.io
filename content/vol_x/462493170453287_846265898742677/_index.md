   "message": "Wisdom from Dean (In Genuine Free-Dumb English):\n\n\"Duh, Chyna got loz uv Yoo Ess Dollaars so I gess dey want 2 bee guvern'd\"\n\nLIE: China has PURCHASED US DEBT. The TENDER FOR LAW that the DEBT provides, PROTECTS THE SECURED PARTY (China). It's also why they kept Hong Kong a \"LEGAL\" zone. They didn't do it because they are such nice guys!\n\n\"Duh, Derz No proof dat yoozing munee iz consent 2 bee guvern'd\"!\n\nUSING LEGAL TENDER binds you. Using MONEY does not.\n\nWant proof?\n\nTHIS NOTE - The note the words (NOTICE) is written on.\n\nIS LEGAL - CODES, ACTS, AND STATUTES with the force of law.\n\nTENDER - tender verb\nten�dered ten�der�ing \nDefinition of TENDER\n\ntransitive verb\n1: to make a tender of\n2: to present for acceptance : offer \"tendered my resignation\"\nintransitive verb\n: to make a bid or tender\nOrigin of TENDER\nMiddle English tendren, from Anglo-French tendre offer\nFirst Known Use: 15th century\n\nTHIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER = THIS NOTE IS A TENDER FOR LAW \n\nLEGAL TENDER IS JUST THAT!\n\nLEGAL=SURETY and ACCOUNTING\n\nLEGAL TENDER is ATTACHED to the money, and is NOT THE MONEY!\n\nTHERE IS YOUR PROOF.\n\nI swear I've pointed this out before.\n\nYOU didn't make the money. (I make my own money)\nYOU didn't write the acts, codes, statutes that are TENDERED by use.\n\nWant to know why people stiff you for contracts, Dean? You don't care about the contracts of others, and they don't care about yours.\n\nUnless your signature is on the money (lawfully) you don't get a say in the terms.\n\nHere's his original idiotic quote: \"Using money is not consent to be governed. It's a ridiculous claim that has never been proven. I will not address that matter again. Anyone who thinks it is, get rid of it all and send it right over here. China holds a few trillion in USA Dollars, I guess they want to be governed by the USA?\"\n\nAt this point. that statement can be dismissed as cognitive dissonance, and can be dismissed on its face.\n\nI suspect that he is actually ignoring the realities of SURETY and ACCOUNTING  because then he would have to admit that the \"Evil Satan Devil Admiral\" was right.\n\nYes, admiral! Sound's \"crazy\", huh? Except I own/command a fleet of ships.  :D\n\nI was \"crazy\" when I was going to show people how to build their own banks and currencies, too! :D Until I actually did. :D\n\nA lifetime's work is about to come to fruition now, and I'm making sure people are watching as it happens. Watch Dean too. The score so far:\n\nNov 24 2013: Dean gets escorted out of his lecture about his legal \"victories\", while I commission my 3rd vessel. THE TENDER FOR LAW had been running for almost 9 months. Dean was an Administrator here.\n\nToday: Dean has lied to and betrayed pretty much everyone who's ever come into contact with him. People remember me saying that he does not value any relationships (Except maybe his \"brother\") and suffers chronic \"orphan syndrome\". He now clings to as much truth as he can, while still being able to pander to the Piece-of-Shit Christians, who are the only ones still listening to him.\n\nMy fleet has increased to 7 vessels, and our third global network went live. Blockchain applications are exploding, and everyone who took the time to listen, has done quite well for themselves.\n\nJust remember that you don't get to \"pick and choose\" the parts you like about what I say. I'm the ONLY one who's not lying to you. Stay focused on what you have learned. Dean has sealed his fate, and you waste time you don't get back by listening to him.\n\nYou get answers listening to me. That's not bragging; That's just a fact.",
