   "message": "I do not know the answer, but your question makes me see this possible angle/answer: \n\nMaybe in common law, in the case of \"drugs\" YOU is being charged with possession because there is a presumption that a private person/government has exclusive legal right, and/or title, and/or ultimate control of the use of those plants/drugs. \n\nApparently, a private person CLAIMS to be the OWNER of whatever they say are \"drugs.\" And since YOU does not carry permission from the owner to have it in YOUR possession, with having a \"license\" for example, YOU is violating a some magical CODE. Therefore, YOU is all of the sudden a bad, bad slave! Someone must be called to ACCOUNT! \n\nSo, I think YOU is charged with POSSESSION, because there is a presumed OWNER of those \"drugs.\" Don't take my word for it.",
