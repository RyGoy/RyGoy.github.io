   "message": "The majority of these complaints appear to be coming from Muslims, and suspiciously, the anonymous bulletins full of misinformation are written in Arabic:\n\n\"Peel mother Firani Siddiqui will keep her two younger children home to protest the curriculum she said breaches her right to decide when her children learn sensitive sexual information.\n\n�I don�t want teachers to tell my children that masturbation is a healthy thing � it�s a no no; maybe I don�t want her to think it�s a healthy practice,� said Siddiqui, who said she is not anti-gay, but simply believes the new curriculum gets too explicit too early. �I don�t want a stranger telling my kids about oral and anal sex.�\n\nSchools in Toronto�s largely Muslim neighbourhood of Thorncliffe Park also expect many parents to take part in the sex-ed boycott of school next week, and also try to opt out of the curriculum next fall, said Trustee Gerri Gershon.\"",
