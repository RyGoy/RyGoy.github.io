   "message": "The way I see it, I just never hang out in the park where retarded kids go to play, you know. I guarantee you I have NEVER missed anything from not going. \n\nOther than to follow Scott, Tara, The Tender for Law, Battlefield 2142, The Answer to Everything, and Reasons we need a national Kick a Cop in the face day... what good is Facebook for? Am I missing something? \n\nMy only accomplishment is Michael Rivera, anyone else is just not having it. I can see why Scott gave up on \"us\" long time ago. I have really made a case among what I thought were intelligent folks. They are just not having it. They can't get around the idea that \"authority\" does not exist. They WANT to be told what to do, and they want to HURT others that do not think like them.",
