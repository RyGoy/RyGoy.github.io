   "message": "Re: the issues.  If memory serves there were two.  The first is hard to describe, but essentially is like showing someone a clock and then asking them to build a watch.  There are cases where (to me at least) the foregoing information was insufficient to extrapolate how to complete the requested tasks.  \n\nThe second involves the site itself.  You can't (or at least could not) proceed to the next task until you complete the current one.  In the cases where they said you could input any working code, any working code was not always accepted.  You could put your code into a code analyzer and it would come up clean.  On the site, however, sometimes the module was broken and needed to be restarted, or your code needed to be rewritten until it exactly matched their expectations.  When you are trying to learn something, accurate information is key.",
