   "message": "Example:\n\nThe Quebec Revenue Agency conducted a criminal investigation on the legal entity named PIERRE DAOUST.\n\nThey have conducted that investigation through the chartered accountant, and it has an effect that the chartered accountant stopped servicing every affairs involving the person named PIERRE DAOUST. He got scared :/\n\nWhen I approach another chartered account, and tell him/her the truth on WHY the previous chartered accountant stopped servicing, they don't want to offer their services... :(\n\nI would have to LIE to get a new chartered accountant, it seems so... :/\n\nNow, I want to have an audio of that criminal investigation conducted by QRA over the phone with the accountant. I know QRA record all calls.....\n\nShould I claim, demand or request this audio ?",
