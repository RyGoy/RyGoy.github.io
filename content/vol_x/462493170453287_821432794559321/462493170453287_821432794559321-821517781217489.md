   "message": "Here I am .... a stranger on the Internet (and an ignorant 'Murikan nonetheless), who happened to meet up with a Greasy Spic in Toronto, and headed to the Admiral's flagship.  We were greeted as welcomed guests. AND, it was the Admiral's birthday....not a hint of us intruding!\n\nThen, Scott decides to voluntarily host a weekly Skype chat and stays up until 6 am with us as we metaphorically threw feces at each other.  \n\nHe has said since the beginning that the only accounting for all this was to tell others what we have learned and lead them to the articles.  \n\nHe has given me the ONLY chance a guy like me has of thinking right and valuing the right things.  Turns out, the child abuse (programming) is the root.  He introduced us to Computer Science, which, coincidentally, has very little to do with computers, but it is the answer to everything.  This single point is so important and obvious now.  \n\nAnd this is what I am thankful for.  Thanks Scott and thanks Tara!\n\nBut Tara, what do you mean by \"party-up\"?",
