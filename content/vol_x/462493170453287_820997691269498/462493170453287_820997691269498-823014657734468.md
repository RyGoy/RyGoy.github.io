   "message": "Hey, good day to ALL of yous :D\n\nAt one point, the judge had anything else in his mind than to book the hearing, I said I don�t understand, we need to identify the party with surety first��.he said that the party with surety will be present on Nov. 16th 2015.\n\nSo, the logical thing for me to do now is to send that judge an invoice, because obviously I need the surety BEFORE Nov. 16th��.I have 72 hours in this, as Administrator, and if I want to hire a GOOD lawyer to offer a decent defense to MY person, these guys charges $1000 per hour, and I suspect it will be li 25 hours minimum�.\n\nSo, before Nov. the 16th, I need a cheque of $97,000.00, right ? \n\n:D",
