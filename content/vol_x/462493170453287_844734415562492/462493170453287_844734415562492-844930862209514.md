   "message": "The problem with Dan LIEN-YOUR-NAME Wilson and his ilk, is that they can't see beyond next week, much less grasp concepts like Ethereum, and Blockchain applications (Like bitcoin), and what it is doing and WILL do to the current system. They would rather laugh at some free-dumber getting hurt for \"Not respecting authority\", all the while, never even grasping the outer edges of what pieces of shit they are.\n\nAll of them would laugh at you being harmed because of magic parchments written by strangers. They think it's ok to hurt people who \"don't have lights on their bike\" because the magic parchments say so.\n\n...I've always thought it's ok to hurt people who hold that value system. We all have our moral crosses to bear. :D",
