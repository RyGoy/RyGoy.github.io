   "message": "If suddenly Quatloos goes silent... assume I had something to do with it. They seem to want to talk about me, and lie as much as they can get away with.\n\nFirst they Lie and say I didn't pay my mortgage. It was PAID OFF.\n\nThen they lie about what I say.\n\nWell they have my attention. They can prepare for things they THINK are Illegal, and MAYBE even line a lawyer's pockets!\n\nMr. Kirov, these guys are yours. 90 days' expenses. That's UNLIMITED BUDGET for 90 days. Take these fuckers down.",
