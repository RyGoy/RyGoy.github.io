   "message": "Here's my prediction, if Erich picks up this gig:\n\n1: Quatloos will experience something that AT FIRST GLANCE will APPEAR \"illegal/unlawful\" but when they seek remedy, nobody will do anything, so they will shop around for a LAWYER!\n\n2: An unscrupulous scumbag ambulance-chaser will attempt to get a retainer and then bury them in \"preliminary\" work billing.\n\n3. When the Quatloos idiots see they are being fleeced, the lawyer will suddenly say \"nothing illegal was done\".\n\n4: I laugh. A lot, because fuck you.",
