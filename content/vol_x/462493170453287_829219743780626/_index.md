   "message": "A response to the �Booty�tards.\n\nDear Honored Members,\n\nSlam Poetry ? aside. \nIn all seriousness,\n\n     To correct some information�s that come to mind after pondering, \nThen in turn, reviewing the information presented on this most precious place of actual knowledge; The Tender For Law. The actual importance of that simple phrase. I was Full Retard many times, in an endeavor to discover the truths hidden in plai\nn sight.\n\nThe �verify everything for your self� method.\n\n      I did not believe a word of anything the Admiral presented without verifying that piece of knowledge, it took years. \nI have been a member here since Nov 2012.\n\nI was invited after hearing about one of That Clifford guy�s arrests and looking on his wall and I was introduced to the word Hubris for the first time by some one who knew how to use it, The Admiral and Dan Wietz.\n\n You think you �booty� Tards, Can slam me? \n\nYou have nothing on a tag team from these astute knowledgeable personas.\n\nThe Point being, I was fortunate to have been part of a very intense learning curve for about 8 weeks at the very beginning of my membership here. then I kept plugging away. That has not stopped. I have questioned my sanity many times.\nI have earned my place here.\n\nI was not part of any private club.  I am not like most of the ones reading this. I have been trained as an investigative journalist.\nI have been in court many times and have had things vacated and such, but believing something not true about this whole person thing.\n\nI had to break out and hack my previous programming.\n\nI had to create my own thing.  I had to learn to think in legalese to see how these fuckers thought. To prevent further fucking around.\nThe Trust of what ever is a shield in that realm. However learning to use it one must be careful what they wish for.\n\nI learned some very important things such as; the why of installing a parliament in a place. The why of a private person constitution.\nHaving a person, not being a person, it�s not my fucking name�\n\nI wish to say thank you for all of your slams, honesties and pointing me to the correct directions.  \nIt enabled me to finally find some True facts. \nAFTER a Life long investigation for me. \nI am an agent of me.\nSo a respectful Fuck You Too those this applies to.\n THAT IS IN ENGLISH.\n\n",
