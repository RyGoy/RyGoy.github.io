   "message": "Hmmm....my thoughts\n1. Democracy = Mob rule...it's only a matter of time before the majority tires of being robbed by the minority and democracy will be unable toprevent the oppressed from rising against it.\n2. Globalisation...contrary to popular belief this does not make the world one big happy family.  The Global system is a centralized system run and controlled by centralized governments. These are systems that do not act in the best interests of those they were created to serve\n3. War is old fashioned...so is religion and belief in imaginary friends :P As long as BELIEF dominates the minds of the majority they willl continue to be wrong and evil will persist. There's no escaping this reality.\n4. Borders are fixed...but the banking system's reach has no borders. Fixed borders did not prevent the global financial system from near collapse. Collapse the banking system and a free for all will ensue.",
