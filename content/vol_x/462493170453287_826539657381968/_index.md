   "message": "Friend of mine is wondering why the mother of a child has an automatic legal status as guardian and the unmarried father needs to submit a declaration, to be affirmed by the mother, in order to be legally recognised as the father... \n\nIs it simply because she spent 9 months carrying the child and the father spent 2 minutes \"making\" it?",
