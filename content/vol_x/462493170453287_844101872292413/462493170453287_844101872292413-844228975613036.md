   "message": "1) Thank you Scott Duncan. And Tara Duncan. Another invaluable contribution to the Creative Commons. I'll never be able to repay the debt I owe you both, but I intend to spend the rest of my life trying.\n\n2) My excuse for not posting sooner is a bad one. I was reading the article on your page Scott, and I don't have permission to comment there. Only just realized that I can comment on this one in TTFL.\n\n3) Either this was the simplest of your 'FOR IDIOTS' series, or some of this stuff is actually starting to sink in. (Very late, I know)\n\n4) As has been mentioned many times, the comments on these posts are almost as valuable as the posts themselves.\n\n\"Claiming \"ownership\" of me, is a LICENSE for me to kill you.\"\n\nI finally understand LICENSE.",
