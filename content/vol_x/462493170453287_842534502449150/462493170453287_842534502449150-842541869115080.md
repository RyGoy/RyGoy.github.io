The article attempts to equate subsequent Acts Statutes, Charters and Cartas as being LAW while they only have the the force of law, and are an attempt to reflect the colour of law.\n\n\"...and made government executive decisions contestable in civil courts.\" Nope.\n\nWTF is \"Basic Law\"? I don't recall ever hearing about Basic Law.\n\n\"...despite the fears of lawyers ï¿½ attempted to curb its Rule of Law.\" Lawyers aren't concerned with LAW (of the land), they are concerned with LEGAL (admiralty and commercial jurisdictions).\n\nI hope this isn't a big shitstain! Great exercise. Still thinking about it.",
