   "message": "Then this: \"In Canada you can get around the accounting by getting a JUSTICE to endorse \"IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE\" as a means of discharging the account. I got PAID for providing the \"service\" to the government... in the EXACT same way a \"justice\" does.\"\n\nThis is sinking in...but the mechanics are vague.  If one gets called to account and is deemed to have surety, hence convicted, it seems, hmm, how do I say this, WRONG for a Justice to discharge the matter in its (his?) own interests.  \n\nIf I have this correct, once you were deemed to have surety, hence convicted, you passed that on to a Justice (somehow), so, in its (his?) own interest, discharged the matter. :/",
