   "message": "It's a BIT more than \"Ego\", because to do that would be to acknowledge that I have been telling the truth all along.\n\n...and people spent FIAT on Dean. People will take that shit PERSONALLY. Imagine, if you will, that YOU are one of the Piece-of-Shit Christians following him. Three years you've watched the \"Devil\" and his \"blasphemous truth\" torment your hero Dean Clifford...only to find he admits that I'm right, have no \"victims\" and NEVER CHARGE MONEY. It would be as if Dean were saying \"Scott is ALWAY RIGHT\"! THAT is unacceptable.\n\n Imagine having 3 years of your life wasted on listening to non-truth, only to find that \"The Devil\" is the only one who's been telling the truth, and \"Freeman Jesus\" publically declares SCOTT IS ALWAYS RIGHT! Just imagine that scenario. \n\nNow imagine that you are Dean with 200+ angry Piece-of-Shit Christians looking to get some answers as to why \"the Devil\" keeps telling the truth, and giving ACTUAL answers, and Dean charges money for \"seminars\".\n\n...HEY, do you suppose Clifford The Free-Dumb Teddy-Bear will appear in court as an exhibit? :D",
