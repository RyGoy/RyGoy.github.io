   "message": "When I TRULY believed I was \"hunting the bad guys\", I knew I couldn't be stopped. I was VERY good at tracking them down and eliminating them from government service.\n\nI was in a contracted supernumerary position, so I was \"untouchable\".\n\nI remember that feeling of being paid to \"do the right thing\". I was in my 20's and really thought I was \"fixing the system from within\". It turns out I very efficiently eliminated everyone who could have helped us today. That is just ONE of the terrible things I've done to you, that you don't even know you are a victim of. \n\nIf I wasn't so good in my 20's you'd have a fractured and polarized government right now, not a police state.\n\nIn ONTARIO, it's MY FAULT. I'm the reason why there are no \"good\" government workers. I hunted them to extinction.\n\nIf you EVER wonder why I give you all so much, this is why. Yes, I am keeping a promise, but I don't need to do that much to fulfil my obligations there. The rest is from ME. It's the least I can do. Call it \"atonement\".  It's also why I'll NEVER, EVER charge money. EVER.",
