   "message": "When I said \"Great Minds don't work for the Government\", because in order to HAVE a \"great mind\", Government is, by its very nature, ethically repugnant. Tendering the PURCHASE of \"problem children\" who passed certain tests, was the Government's solution to this problem.\n\nThere's LOTS of kids the government can secund from church ORGANIZATIONS like the CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY (SOCIETY!) which you will find is a CATHOLIC CHURCH ORGANIZATION. These don't tend to produce the brightest children, as Catholic doctrine is to dumb down by force.\n\n...but kids that are SOLD to them, well not only will the parents not notice them MISSING, they won't CARE.\n\nMost end up dead in their mid-20s or serving \"life\" for a crime they had nothing to do with.\n\n...all in \"service\" to the Government.",
