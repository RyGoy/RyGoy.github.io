   "message": "Here's the thing about \"criminal Records\"; They can't be erased. They are written to READ ONLY medium (Optical). When I am \"arrested\", the arresting officer can ADD NOTATIONS to the \"record\", and it's there for good! A record can only be \"sealed\". This stupid mechanism is why any Police dept will look me up and see \"Occupation: Computer Operator\" ***CONDITION: MENTALLY ILL*** AKA \"Doctor Who\". They made the shit up as they went along, depending on what they needed.\n\nI'm not making that up! Call Defective Poutine at 32 Division, and and ask him! :D\n\nhttp://www.thesunshinelist.com/salary-disclosure/martin-fabian-poulin/city-of-toronto--police-service",
