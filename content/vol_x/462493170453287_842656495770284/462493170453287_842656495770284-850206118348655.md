   "message": "For instance this...which passed with seemingly no questions:\n\nScott Duncan Re:\"Queenï¿½s Bench Justice Chris Martin instructed the court clerk to record that as a \"not guilty\" position. That drew the ire of Clifford, who repeatedly insisted the federal government has no standing to prosecute him.\" - IDIOCY! You QUESTION! QUESTIONING NEGATES UNDERSTANDING! Ask BY WHAT AUTHORITY do YOU enter a plea on ANYONE'S behalf?\n\nMost don't realize that BENEFIT of the doubt, means something LEGALLY (Surety and accounting) and that is the defense every \"justice\" uses when they are called on their unlawful acts. If the ACCUSED (not a \"defendant\") is absent at proceedings, a justice MAY preserve the BENEFIT of the doubt FOR the accused, and enter a NOT GUILTY PLEA, on behalf (as agent) of the accused.\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE, clears that up! The Justice MISTAKENLY thought he/she had permission/licence to ACT as AGENT.\n\nThen demand the JUSTICE pony up security for costs, because you intend to get a VERY expensive lawyer. grin emoticon",
