   "message": "Ok, so at one point JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN was convicted of something and sentenced, yet no man ever sat in s cage? 2 things are going through my head, one is that the person named on the Drivers License is not the same person on the court file and secondly \"where is the surety\". \n\nBut I can't comprehend how they accounted for this.
