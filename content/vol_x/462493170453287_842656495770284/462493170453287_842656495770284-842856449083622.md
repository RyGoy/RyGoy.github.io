   "message": "\"Unless you were sold to the government as a youth in the 70's, you've no hope of EVER claiming the title.\" \n\nI don't think I want this title but this is still interesting. Okay if this means what I think it does this is surprising. Let's see if my understanding is correct. I was \"sold\" to the government in 1973 (The year I was REGISTERED).  When you write SOLD I wish to confirm that this is refering to and/or includes the birth registration?",
