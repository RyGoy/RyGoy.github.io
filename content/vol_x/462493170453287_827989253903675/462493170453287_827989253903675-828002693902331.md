   "message": "Harry Wombat, here you go: <<Think very carefully about this. If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling\nand its rules, you might raise the obvious question, �Why do you get to move two pieces?� If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?\n\nIf you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that's when you're going to �understand� that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game. You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert. \n\nNovice drivers and expert drivers all have to follow the same rules. You don't get to ignore rules because you suck at them. Just as my chess board is not a chess school, the court will not allow the presumption that you being a novice is a lawful excuse. The only method to extract yourself �with honour� is to accept responsibility for the mistake in presumption. They are presuming something wrong...and you are acknowledging it's your fault. The court must accept this MISTAKE, and your entreaty for forgiveness for the unintended debt created. The court MUST do this. - Scott Duncan>>",
