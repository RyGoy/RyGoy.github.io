I intend to collect.\n\nWhile I have been waiting, I have been very busy organising my toys.   I wish to be left alone by government/law society. whilst I play with my toys and collect debts owed.\n\nI'll balance the books one way or another. My life's work is a waste, otherwise. My only regret is all the amazing things I did, for all the wrong people. Those people owe me.\n\nI intend to collect.",
