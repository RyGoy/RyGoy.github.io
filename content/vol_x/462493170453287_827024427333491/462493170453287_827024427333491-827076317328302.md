   "message": "YOU are the creator. Congress just gave the authorization of the Fed to act on its Charter, the Federal Reserve Act, which made the United States surety. Every time you need an FRN, you create the obligation on the books of the United States, it says so in Section 16. The fee for this service is 6%, it says so in Section 27. The obligation of the actual note is discharged when the Money of Exchange is registered as Money of Account. \n\nSo, through the entire process of MONEY, YOU are in control, thereby, YOU are the Creator. Government, in this case \"the United States in Congress assembled\" (got that?) just authorized to being the surety....which is all they do. They also administrate surety....see Dean.",
