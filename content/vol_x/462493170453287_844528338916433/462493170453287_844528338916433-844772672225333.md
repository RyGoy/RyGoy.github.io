   "message": "To me, it seems glaringly obvious how immensely valuable nearly everything Scott says/writes is. As such, for a while, I was baffled at how few people seem to 'follow' him. How few people seem to be in these groups. \n\nSurely there should be tens of thousands of people literally starving for the kind of truth Scott regularly shares for FREE. So where are they all?\n\nI think their absence is explained by the following quote:\n\n\"Don't secure your name if you don't have any actual value. If you have no value, you will starve to death.\" -Scott Duncan\n\nWhat's worse, is that many people who DO have value, can't see any way to be valuable without the current system.\n\nIts still the reason I'm a slave. I'm afraid to starve to death.",
