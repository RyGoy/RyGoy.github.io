   "message": "I will have a crack at this. Please correct me where (not if because I expect I will be) I'm wrong.\n\n\"See, quite simply, without a BILL, there is no obligation! PERIOD!\"\n\nMissing this perhaps?\nNecessity for presentment\n84. (1) Subject to this Act, a bill must be duly presented for payment.\nIf not presented\n(2) If a bill is not duly presented for payment, the drawer and endorsers are discharged.\n\n\"First of all, you need to know what a BILL is, and what a bill is NOT! An INVOICE, or STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT is NOT a BILL! Do they say BILL on them? NO! They say INVOICE, or STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT or CHARGE, not BILL! Now an INVOICE, or STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT simply describes what was sold, how much it was sold for. It does the same the clerk does, it simply announces what the charge is, BUT IT IS NOT THE CHARGE!\"\n\nMissing some definitions:\nInvoice, n. An itemized list of goods or services furnished by a seller to a buyer, usu. specifying the price and terms of sale; a bill of costs\n\nStatement of account. 1. A report issued periodically (usu. monthly) by a bank to a customer, providing certain information on the customer's account, including the checks drawn and cleared, deposits made, charges debited, and the account balance.\n\nCharge,vb. 6. To demand a fee; to bill\n\n\"A bill is: An unconditional ORDER in writing....\"\n\norder,n.1. A command, direction, or instruction.\n\n\"Did you get that? If they give you a bill, and even if they fail to complete it, or sign it, you can simply accept it, sign it and give it back to them! Don�t believe? Check out the so-called �laws� of CANADA.\nBILLS OF EXCHANGE ACT\n57. (1) Every party whose signature appears on a bill is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, deemed to have become a party thereto for value.\"\n\nMissing\nWhat required of corporation\n5. In the case of a corporation, where, by this Act, any instrument or writing is required to be signed, it is sufficient if the instrument or writing is duly sealed with the corporate seal, but nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the bill or note of a corporation to be under seal.\nSo the corporate logo/letterhead at the top of the page is a seal.\n\n\"I think you should be getting very excited by now! This is telling you that if you sign the bill, you gave it value! It�s telling you that your signature IS the money! BY signing the bill, and returning it to them, you gave them value! It says, �In absence of evidence to the contrary�. Where is that going to come from?\"\n\nMisleading here because it says \"By signing the bill...\" , yet he already said that we don't have a bill, and they will never give one, so how do we sign the bill? Does he mean to convert the invoice to a completed bill of exchange? (Pete's thread covers that...)\n\n\"What if they refuse to provide a bill? Then they have admitted to no obligation!\"\nMissing same as above...\n\n\"If they refuse to give you a bill, you can now take out a blank piece of paper, fill it out as a bill with them as drawer and payee,....\"\n\nI am pretty sure that Scott said that a bill of exchange should be notarized.\n\n\" If they threaten to call the police, YOU CALL THE POLICE! \"\nThis looks like the worst part of the whole article! Those cops have guns, and there is a whole facebook group full of reasons to never ever have any dealings with police. Why not take the entire process into a place that you can safely control. I.E. PRIVATE\nScott has told us that if it is hard, you are doing it wrong. A dispute at the register with the clerk and calling the police is not the best way to go I think.\n\n\"You merchants out there are still wondering how to get cash out of this and believe me, there are ways, just too much information to go into here for the purpose of this essay.\"\nThis entire point should be expanded upon because it reveals the mechanism to take the entire process into the private.\n\n\"I encourage you not to accept anybody�s unsubstantiated opinions on this, hell, don�t believe me!\"\n\nExcellent piece of advice. Scott always tells us \"Trust but VERIFY\"\n\nThe first section of that post has a lot of statements that are not backed up with any evidence yet there are others that are. Why is that? This is where lies of omission can be inserted isn't it?",
