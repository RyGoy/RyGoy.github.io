   "message": "Continued\n\"God Bless brothers and sisters, go get em\"\nYech, that's hard to stomach... When I see stuff like this I expect harm to be nearby. To continue the exercise though let's push past it. The MISSING/WRONG is the harm after all right?\n\nI have not yet seen any mention of SURETY and ACCOUNTING yet though, That is certainly missing so far.\n\n\"Further explanations:\nFirstly I'd like to point out an omission in that essay on Bills of Exchange and that this a Bill should have the words \"Consumer Purchase\" written on it's face as well. (This is in regard to the first blog he put out on the subject - above)\"\n\nWe have a different author entering the post here it seems.\n\n\"The section of the act that inquirer is referring to regarding the acceptance of the BOE....\"\nMissing the reference point to the act. Section 34-37\n\n\"The fact is, that via the sin application, you granted Power of Attorney to the government to access that account in exchange for benefits, and I think that probably has to be rectified. They require the access in order to provide you with the benefits that you have requested, but you have also granted them the POA, which as we both well know, they translate to ownership of YOU!\"\n\nIs this part wrong? I do not recall Scott saying anything like this.",
