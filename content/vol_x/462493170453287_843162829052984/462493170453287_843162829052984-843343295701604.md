Until you can answer that, and do it yourself then, like it or not, I'm the best you've got. :P\n\nBe it Robert Menard and his lies of omission.\nOr Dean Clifford's Orphan Syndrome\nOr good ol' Piece-of-Shit Jesus...\n\nEVERY \"guru\" charges money, and sells you EXTRA bullshit on top of what little truth they say.\n\nI charge NOTHING, have NO VICTIMS and give ACTUAL ANSWERS.\n\nNone of the Marcus', Menards, Cliffords, Lentzs and other idiot scammers, can EVER compete with that.",
