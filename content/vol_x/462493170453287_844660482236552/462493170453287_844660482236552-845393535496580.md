   "message": "To me, this whole �new tactic� of Deans seems designed to ensure lots of �idiot� freedumb fighters arguing in the courts for more profits. (A condition, perhaps?) WAM, (Winnipeg Alternative Media) is using Deans �following� as a stepping stone in its �investigative alternative media� life span and Dean is using this outlet, as well as other outlets, as the class rooms to supply future �idiots� to the courts to fleece. Of course, as is always the case, both camps are asking for donations. Not to say that supporting alternative media is wrong, but in this case, if they are promoting Dean�s �I am an idiot� defense to be used in the courts, well then, they would be wrong and are causing potential harm to those who would listen to such irresponsible nonsense.",
