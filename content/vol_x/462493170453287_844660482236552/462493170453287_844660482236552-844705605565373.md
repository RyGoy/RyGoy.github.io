   "message": "A lot happened since that thread, INCLUDING DEAN HAVING FRIENDS \"SWATTED\" TO BUY HIS WAY OUT OF THE FORTRESS OF REMAND*\n\nSo now he owes a debt (Sold) and I have taken over the planet with the grandchildren of my creation. What will I do in a FIVE year period? The mind boggles.\n\n*This backfired, because Dean assumed that the \"Weapons Expert\" he was helping to screw over, was hiding illegal/prohibited weapons, like HE does and he was surprised to find that his victim ISN'T ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING ILLEGAL/UNLAWFUL, and never did! So now he owes a debt to TWO PEOPLE, AND MY CLAIM COMES FIRST, THUS SCREWING HIM OVER AGAIN!\n\nThis is accounting that will come up at a later date.",
