   "message": "Do all the Free-Dumbers think these SUPERNUMERARY CONTRACTORS think there is some sort of PERSONAL stake and they are offended?\n\nDoes Dean REALLY think he made this disinterested contractor ANGRY? REALLY?\n\nI have held MANY supernumerary positions, and I did not get hurt feelings if someone said, for example \"CIBC SUCKS\". Anyone who testified afterwards; \"I told him 'CIBC SUCKS' and oh boy did Scott Duncan get mad!\" is delusional. It's just not a BELIEVABLE STATEMENT! It's not even a RATIONAL one.\n\nYet Dean would have you believe THIS SUPERNUMERARY CONTRACTOR was different, and really, really had hurt feelings! Dean made him SO mad! Oh yes! We just have to ignore the REALITY that the \"Justice\" does it for a living and he is used to dealing with unhappy victims. Here in REALITY Dean doesn't do anything that upsets ANYONE. That's MY job :D\n\n...is this the part where Piece-of-Shit Jesus intervenes? You might as well throw Piece-of-Shit Jesus in too, since we've already left reality and now dwell in a universe of fantasy, where contractors take it personally when their client is \"insulted\"!",
