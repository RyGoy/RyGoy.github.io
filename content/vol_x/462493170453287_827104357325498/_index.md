   "message": "I have waited in line for 2 hours to have a place for my boy at the local clinic. I noticed that his person's medical card is expired and never received a renewal for it! :/\n\nSo came to the desk and after establishing the facts, I asked if they could send an invoice. The lady at the desk told me that I would have to pay 20$ before seeing a doctor and pay the balance after the consultation. \n\nIt's not the 20$, it's the fact that they want you to pay, upfront ! :/",
