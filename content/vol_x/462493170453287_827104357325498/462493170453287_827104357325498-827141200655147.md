   "message": "I asked for an invoice after giving them another 20$ AFTER the consultation.\nThe lady gave me the \"DEMANDE DE REMBOURSEMENT � LA PERSONNE ASSUR�E\". \n\nI said: this is not an invoice!\n\nShe said: yes it is! It's what you need to get refunded for the costs of today's consultation!\n\nI said: But it doesn't say invoice on it. What do you give to those who don't have a card or come from another country?\n\nShe took out a small invoice with a carbon copy attached to it and \"we give them this!\".\n\nI said: Ok then I'll have one of those, please!\n\nShe said: Why? \n\nI said to balance my accounting! \n\nShe said: Ok I'll have to give it to the doctor so he can fill it out. \n\n*Jeopardy music*\n\n... then she came back with another lady...\n\nOther lady: ... same bla, bla. + people are not suppose to pay for there medical care so that is why we give you this so you can get refunded.\n\nI said: But suppose I wasn't going to renew the medical card and I just wanted to pay for this consultation THEN I could take the small invoice and take this \"DEMANDE DE REMBOURSEMENT � LA PERSONNE ASSUR�E\" (and shove it up your ..., I degress! :P) and send it to the RAMQ?\n\nShe said: NO!!! Then you would have two proofs of having paid for one consultation. \n\nI said: Ok then I'll take the small INVOICE and give you back the \n\"DEMANDE DE REMBOURSEMENT � LA PERSONNE ASSUR�E\". \n\nShe said: No this small invoice is ONLY for foreign citizens and since we are not suppose to pay for our medical care then this is the only document you will get. She said this is your invoice.\n\nI said: This is an invoice even though it doesn't say INVOICE on it?\n\nShe said: YES! It's totally legal ! \n\nI said: ok. \n\nAnd I left ! \n\nThe pressure you get for questionning anything is unbeleivable! :O\n\nWhat a training/knowledge it takes to come out of your shell of beleifs! :/",
