I used to use a Co-op bank (years ago), now Scott has told us that Credit Unions are what we should use.  \n\nIt seems that a Credit Union is a  cooperative organization that is non-profit.  (That sounds good). \n\nBut this mutual company seems to have a duty to reciprocate something....ownership in exchange for deposits???\n\nWhat is the difference between a mutual bank and a cooperative bank?",
