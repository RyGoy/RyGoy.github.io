   "message": "Hey guys, this shit just went through my brain !! :-o\n\nThe Sun, here in Quebec, is not legal nor illegal. I can take its energy, through a solar panel, and use it, without asking for permission, and/or BUYING a permit.\n\nIn Spain, since they are ahead of us by two or three years on this AUSTERITY program, the Sun can be legal or illegal, because you have to PAY for a permit to use its energy through a solar panel. So I predict that the Sun will be legalized in two to three years, here in Quebec :D\n\nAnyone could put this in his/her calendar ? �.just to verify if I can predict the future !!! :D\n\nOh, and since it�s written �This note is LEGAL tender� on these bank notes, you will certainly be able to PAY for the LEGAL Sun with that crap :D\n\nYou�re Welcome.\nPete \"Crystal ball\" Daoust.",
