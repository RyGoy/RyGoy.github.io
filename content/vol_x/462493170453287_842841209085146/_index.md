   "message": "THIS. THIS is one of the \"gateways\" to THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING from THE TENDER FOR LAW.\n\nIt will allow you to make dumb machines \"smart\" and (even better) allow you to replace the \"brains\" of existing \"smart\" machines. This knowledge will soon be CRIMINALIZED, and is part of the WAR ON GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTING. This is the grandaddy of the rights you didn't know you need/have.\n\nThis is just something I am pointing at, that you should examine. As I said, a few months ago, you Simu-Drones need to \"up your game\". You are going to learn new skills. Skills you will need to fight what's coming.\n\nThis is ARDUINO.
