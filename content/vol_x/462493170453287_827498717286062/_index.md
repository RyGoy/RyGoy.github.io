   "message": "Because my intent is to NOT buy back public debt, since this debt is being fraudulently created (COMER vs Bank of Canada), i have made the decision to not be surety over ANY public debts.\n\nSo, I was interceted by a Public debt Creator (Police Ofiicer) on highway 40 on October the 28th 2014, and since I refuse to be surety for ANY public debt, I refused to give the name of the legal person I happen to possess to that  Public debt Creator (Police Officer) on that day, my intent was to IDENTIFY the party with surety before giving any public name to that Public debt Creator. \n\nI just wanted to make sure that no juridical personality would be attributed to me without the RIGHTS that come with it, as article 332 of the Quebec Civil Code state clearly, I mean no big deal there :/\n\nOf course, that debt Creator FORCED me, kidnapped me, and took the NAME without me consenting to it....\n\nAnd he was very proud about taking that picture of me, while I was in his cage, to show the world how weirdo I was..... :/\n\nBut now it will be somewhat difficult for him to negate the FACT that PROPER NOTICE was made about me NOT being SURETY. :D\n\nThis might fit well in the \"IRONY DEPT\" :/",
