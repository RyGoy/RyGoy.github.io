   "message": "Scott, last night, during the call, there was a mention of giving Duty Council a notarized Birth Certificate with instructions.  One time, probably my second time in court, I was locked up in a cell....which was how I spent most of my time in court actually.  A Court Appointed Lawyer came in to \"represent me\".  I said \"Oh, you are representing me?\" I slid a Certified Copy of Live Birth under the cell door and said \"so give this to the Justice\".  He slid it back under the door and said \"i won't represent you\" and left.",
