   "message": "Re: court,\nI once sat in a court, all afternoon, until their business was done, then the administrator (justice) asked me if he could help me.  I said yes there had been a mistake and I need these 2 warrants vacated. He said sure, I was then sent to the clerk downstairs to get the file put to the courtroom (this was prior to learning what is taught here.) I did not claim anything other than a mistake had been made. I explained the situation, cops scheduling court on a holiday (news year eve day), the Justice vacated the warrants.The Clerk of the court hollered across the room. �It is good To See You Jason�. When I was leaving.  It took me along while to figure it all out.\nI too am sorry to have missed the call. ?",
