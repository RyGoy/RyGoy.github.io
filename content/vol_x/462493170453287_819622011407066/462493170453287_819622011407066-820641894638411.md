   "message": "Chris Evan, when you look at the mechanics of money of the current system, money, and it's various forms, are split into different ways that you may store, transfer, and/or use that money, and it's not all connected. This creates extreme inefficiencies, both in time and cost, among many others.\n\nYou can do everything a bank does now, and  MORE with the Bitcoin protocol. The current bank system is LITERALLY a decaying corpse. Bitcoin is by far a BETTER form of money. \n\nRemember for the FIRST TIME in the history of mankind, you may anonymously, and safely transfer VALUE to ANYWHERE in the world in the matter of seconds,  or minutes. Bitcoin is a unified protocol for transmitting VALUE. Not only any amount, from micro-payments to billions, but you may send ANYTHING OF VALUE, without governmental, and/or banking interference, like  cars, houses, contracts, arbitration, anything of VALUE, etc.\n\nThe possibilities are limitless.",
