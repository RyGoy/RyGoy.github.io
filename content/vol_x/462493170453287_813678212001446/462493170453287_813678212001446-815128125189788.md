   "message": "Here's a resume of what Scott liked in the answers to the question:\n\nI would like my computer to�\n_________________________________________________\n\nScott Duncan:  You are limited ONLY by your imagination.\n\nLook at what we will NEED as a group, and build on that. A SECURE ANONYMOUS ENCRYPTED virtual meeting room, for example.\n\nWe eed to get the CONCEPT out, and establish a standard. W do it OUT IN THE OPEN where EVERYONE CAN SEE, so they can:\n\n1: Copy it.\n\n2: Know that it can't be stopped, so there is no fucking point in fighting us\n\n________________________________________________\n\nHere it goes:\n\n1: Secure Phones They want to communicate on a network that cannot be shut off, or listened to.\n\n2: Remote Decentralized Storage\n\n3: TOR routed by default\n\n4: Detection of malicious code. (Not necessarily AQUILAE ORANGE)\n\n5 : Remote Access from other computers by booting from thumbdrive?\n\n6 : Peer to peer file transfer.  Like a torrent perhaps?\n\n7 : I want a computer that does not compromise any information, if for some reason gets stolen by  thugs-with-guns. \n\n8 : I want a computer that \"makes money\" for me/us, even when it has been turned off. \n\n9 : Secure chat and presentation/discussion with whiteboard similar to BigBluebutton\n\n10 : I am still THINKING about it, but I have to admit that taking care of the grocery was the first thing   that crossed my mind.:P\n\n11 : Node in a Private mesh network, verification services for trustees, notaries, private men and  women.\n\n12 : ...if my computer could IDENTIFY the ennemy, very precisely, (name, address, date of birth  and/or Incorporation) in real time.\n\n13 : � can a computer double as a communications radio?http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/software-defined-radio-kit-rtl-sdr?variant=424034573\n\n14 : I would like the ability to pool resources and to hot swap them. This includes but is  not limited to  physical storage, processing capacity, and mobile data pooling.\n\n15 : Decentralized EOD (Everything On Demand). Your computer/network is as powerful as you need  it to be. Your resources contribute to the Everything when you're not using them.\n\n16 : It can show video from any of those ubiquitous security cameras so we'll always know where it's  safe. Or add cartoon talk bubbles to the feeds for example. To amuse anyone else watching it.\n\n17 : I would like a computer that organizes, encrypts, and distributes my data off-site so I never lose  anything.\n\n18 : I would like my computer to allow me to cause \"issues\" for my enemies. Bank account dissapears,  power bill suddenly months past due and gets shut off, arrest warrants issued, get their car  repossessed. Hell the ideas are endless.",
