   "message": "He told us up front at his seminar in Montreal.\n\nHe can not go where we can, he has to stay in a specific LEGAL frame in regards of this shit.....\n\nBut I never seen a LAWYER talk like he does, in terms of blasting the government.\n\nAgain, I know it's a LAWYER, and I do not qualify him as a \"Good Lawyer\", but more as a \"Shit Disturber\".\n\nAnd I like \"Shit Disturbers\", I guess it's a Quebecois thing :/\n\nNow, How long will he be a lawyer, I don't know.......he might get disbared at some point, like Michel Lebrun here in Quebec.....I don't know that part.....\n\nI am not INSPIRED by this guy, I just like \"Shit Disturber\", and he seems to qualify for the TITLE :D",
