   "message": "MONEY that has LEGAL TENDER attached to it, is by its very nature, DEBT IN TRANSIT!\n\nA 10 dollar bill is NOT NEGOTIABLE in itself. It's ALWAYS worth 10 dollars.\n\nYou can ACCEPT a 10 dollar bill IN a negotiation, but the bill itself is NOT NEGOTIABLE. It's ALWAYS worth 10 Dollars.\n\n...just like the TRUE INVOICE that Pete described, is NOT NEGOTIABLE. It's ALWAYS the amount stated. No more. No less. It can ONLY be discharged or Voided. NO NEGOTIATION. The contract already exists.",
