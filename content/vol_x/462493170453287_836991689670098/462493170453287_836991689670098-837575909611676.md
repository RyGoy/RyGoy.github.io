   "message": "Every one of you think you can cherry-pick what I say (Except maybe Pete Daoust) as if I'm only \"sort of right\". Even you Joelle! I'm absolutely certain I've said things you foolishly don't agree with... until you are forced to,by reality.\n\nAll of you \"old school\" crowd know better than to say it out loud, because I always make you feel very silly for believing what you do.\n\nThe FACTS you learn here are contested a lot outside of my earshot, but none of that makes me LESS right.\n\nThree years I've been here, and not even Pete Daoust noticed that a lawyer is playing all of you.\n\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GOOD LAWYER! \n\nYou needn't waste time trying to see IF I'm right (though you should for a while), just figure out WHY I'm right. I already know, so you don't have to tell me when you find out :P",
