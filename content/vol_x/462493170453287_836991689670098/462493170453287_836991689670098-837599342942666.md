   "message": "Rocco Galati is a pressure valve. He is placed there to not let the pressure burst the pot, and at the same time folks doing nothing believe something it's been done by someone. He is like a Canadian Ron Paul, but worse for he is a lawyer.\n\nHe is \"fighting\" big federal government, but surety and accounting are missing from his \"shit disturber\" speech? Is he forgetting the slavery part of the whole government thing?",
