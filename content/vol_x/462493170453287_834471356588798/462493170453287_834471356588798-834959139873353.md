If you want to be recognized as a notary in BC courts you must abide by the Notaries Act http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96334_01. Likewise, if someone wants to use a position in your system they need to follow your law.\n\nRe: https://www.facebook.com/groups/tenderforlaw/permalink/834471356588798/\nFin de la conversation",
