   "message": "Question for Scott.\n\nIf I understood correctly, in your last conference call, you told us that you have the authority to give permission (I'm not sure I understand to who) for him/her, to be a notary.\n\nHere was your exemple of what could have happened in Sino's case when he was convicted of using an unlicensed notary. (Something about a de facto treaty).\n\nSino: \"Hey, we're under treaty isn't that in your AQUILAE TRUST?\"\nScott: \"Yes!\"\nSino: \"Do I have permission to act as the Notary?\"\nScott: \"Yes\"\n\nDone! He's licensed!\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n- What title and/or authority do you possess to be able to do that?\n\n- What treaty were you talking about?\n\nThank you!",
