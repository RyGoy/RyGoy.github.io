   "message": "Allow me to edit...\n\nSo..this guy discusses everything which we know about the collapsing dollar. Then he starts to discuss the International Monetary Fund (herein after 'IMF') and Special Drawing Rights (hereinafter 'SDRs').\nLOTS of omissions in this 6 minute video, such as cryptocurrencies. But one glaring omission I saw was the lack of mention of the Bank of International Settlements (hereinafter 'BIS').\nScott, am I right? Does the BIS have a lot to do with the SDRs? Also, SPECIAL.....RIGHTS......of DRAWING.....for WHOM?",
