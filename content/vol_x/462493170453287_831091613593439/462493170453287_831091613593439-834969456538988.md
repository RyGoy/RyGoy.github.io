   "message": "FUN FACT: Canada USED to have GRAND JURIES. That gave people too much power over police and Crown Attorneys. Now it's not even a faded memory, and the border-line retards in the US wouldn't know their power if it slapped them in the face. US Grand Juries are a fucking joke that can just be used as a rubber stamp.\n\nThe Crown Attorney was not even allowed to CHARGE you without the permission of AT LEAST 25 People from the community. Now people are too ignorant to even grasp what they have lost.",
