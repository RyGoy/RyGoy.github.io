   "message": "It seems Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson ( (y) ) is now \"obligating\" Scott to \"prove your claim that elected judges have ever existed in historical English law\", and we accept.\n\nThere never were. Before 1982, JUDGES were appointed by regional authorities, and often ran for elections on platforms based on who they would appoint as regional Judge. The FEDERAL government was not involved, beyond oversight.\n\nDistraction over.\n\nLIEN YOUR NAME.\n\nPS - This is not an invitation for discussion. That takes time you aren't paying for, and the Admiral does a fine job exposing your lies.",
