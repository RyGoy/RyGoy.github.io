   "message": "I was wondering why \"Dan Wilson\" would refer to Wikipedia for a definition of judge and then write about how CANADA defines judge but not actually refer to the ACTS and STATUTES he seem to like circle jerking to for said definition. \n\nI could find no definition of \"justice\" or \"judge\" in the COURTS OF JUSTICE ACT but there is this from the Provincial Offences Act...\n\nInterpretation\n\n1. (1) In this Act,\n\n...\n\n�court� means the Ontario Court of Justice; (�tribunal�)\n\n�judge� means a provincial judge; (�juge provincial�)\n\n�justice� means a provincial judge OR a justice of the peace; (�juge�)\n\nhttp://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90p33#BK1",
