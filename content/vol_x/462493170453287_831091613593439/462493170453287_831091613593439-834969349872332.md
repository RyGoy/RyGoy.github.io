   "message": "I was too young to know or remember JUDGES. No doubt this is partly to blame for why the term JUDGE is carelessly interchanged with JUSTICE. Nobody NOTICEd the change, just like they didn't NOTICE what the \"repatriation\" of the constitution really was.  \n\nWere these judges actually ELECTED in Canada before 1982?",
