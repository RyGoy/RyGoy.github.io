   "message": "So pay attention to what this dipshit says! He says it's mentioned in the \"Courts of Justice\" act...\n\n...but cannot name even ONE JUDGE.\n\n...he'll say \"Justice\" and \"judge\" are the same (Lies: Judges are nominated/elected by the community. Justices are APPOINTED) but only to distract you from the fact that THERE ARE NO JUDGES. A Justice doesn't have to follow the \"Courts of Justice Act\" because a JUSTICE IS NOT A JUDGE!\n\nA JUSTICE IS NOT A JUDGE, SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RULES.\n\nIf you are compelled to a courtroom, demand to be heard in front of a JUDGE AS DESCRIBED IN THE COURTS OF JUSTICE ACT.\n\nIf they say that a \"Justice\" is the same... DEMAND PROOF! :D",
