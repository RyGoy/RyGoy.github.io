   "message": "This brings up the very important, and still unanswered, question of why is Scott the only one who tells the truth. \n\nThrough the first 10 pages of this thing I read was nothing but pure genius. Then a fucking lie. He argued that I would be judged similar to a tort by a Heavenly Father. \n\nHow is it that he could be right about banks, banking, law, jurisdictions but still succumb to religion?  How does this guy know about the juristic person, contracts, etc and can't see the bullshit religion offers?\n\nWhy is Scott the only man who seemingly can?  The only one who doesn't lie? Why?",
