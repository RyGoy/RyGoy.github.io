   "message": "But if it hasn't been a historical tradition among slave handlers, I mean how can it be possible, right \"Dan\"? :D \n\nSlave Masters can set up whatever \"courts\", and terminology they want. They do not need a judicial election, fuck that! They are slave masters, and you must be ok with it! \"Canada\" it's an internationally recognized slave camp, so magic scriptures, rituals, and parchments are the order of the day. Don't believe me? Look, it's in the \"Law society\" scriptures, so it MUST be true! Of course, that is all \"to my knowledge\" which could be very selective if my check gets affected.",
