   "message": "Remember what this little weasel is trying to distract you from! He starts talking about Magic Parchments to stop you from LIENING YOUR NAME. He says he wants to \"help\" you by keeping you enslaved.\n\nFix that by referring to him as Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson. In fact I'd like that to be the rule henceforth. Don NOT mention Dan Wilson again. You are to ONLY refer to him as Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson.\n\nThat's Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson. Please use all the words :D\n\nLike A Pimp Named Slickback. :D\n\nhttps://youtu.be/A6_zN5Lh2yQ",
