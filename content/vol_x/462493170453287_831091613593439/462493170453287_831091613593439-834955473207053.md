Where do you get this from? With a simple search, I see the term \"Justice of Peace\" used at least as far back as the 1600's in England (see http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jspï¿½).\n\n To my knowledge, judges (or justices) were not historically elected in the English system. Canada is an internationally-recognized Sovereign state. A sovereign state can set up whatever courts and terminology it wants. It can require or not require election of judicial officers as it chooses. \n\nYour personal/foreign law means nothing to them. Thinking otherwise is sovereign citizen/freeman wishful thinking and a mistaken understanding of Public International Law.",
