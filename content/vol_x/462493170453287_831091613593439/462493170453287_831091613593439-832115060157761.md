   "message": "It's the same in our \"civil law\" jurisdiction here. Everyone is appointed. \n\nThe other day I was having a conversation in a car. We were 6 folks in the car, 2 of them lawyers. The lawyers were having a conversation about \"judges\" in PR. \n\nSo there was a moment that I just could not resist and interfered, and I said \"Well, last time I checked, I could not find any \"judges.\" A real jugde holds public trust, after the celebration of an election. What we have are unauthorized ADMINISTRATORS appointed by the governor.\"\n\nAfter my comment, it was the most unconfortable silence I have ever witnessed.",
