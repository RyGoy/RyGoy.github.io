He allegedly creates the universe, is really worried about who you have sex with, and just can't seem to balance that chequebook!\n\nMy my, mister Goodfraudy does not seem to be doing well for himself! God seems to have few fucks to give about his plight! Perhaps Fiat will save him. :D\n\nNow, I'm not really sure, but I think I can take credit for this Piece-of-Shit Christian's downfall. ...or am I grabbing more credit than is due? I should really pay closer attention to the accounting here. :/",
