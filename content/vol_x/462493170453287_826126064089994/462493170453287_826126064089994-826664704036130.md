   "message": "When I read Pete's pasted messages from \"Dan Wilson\", I saw he was trying to desperately to put shade in the only method that would hurt does fuckers... placing a lien on the name using ppsa. And the fact that he is SO insistent about it makes his intent clear. \n\nMaybe the Law Socie.... I mean, \"Dan Wilson\" has given a few of us the last push to lien the name. The Tender for Law that money provides is FRAUD, so I might as well keep creating my own money and take a big dump on their \"joinder.\"",
