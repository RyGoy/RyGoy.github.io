   "message": "That ONE POINT is what everyone misses. Now we have a generation of illiterate morons who are too ignorant to even question the issues knowledgeably.\n\n...and since it's that stupid agent again, I would like to reiterate: LIEN YOUR NAME!\n\nThis is the one thing he REALLY wants you to NOT DO! If a CONFIRMED agent tells you NOT to do something, you should probably do it. ESPECIALLY if said agent tries to sell \"for your own good\".\n\nNOBODY DOES ANYTHING \"for your own good\". There is ALWAYS AN AGENDA. Even HERE, I have made it VERY CLEAR that I have an agenda. Those who claim to be doing out of \"altruism\", MEAN YOU HARM! \n\nJoke all you like about this piece of shit, but remember, AGENTS MEAN YOU HARM. ALL AGENTS! Anywhere! For ANYTHING!\n\nYou only USE agents when fraud/crime is a factor. That is the ONLY REASON to even HAVE agents.\n\nThink about ANY time you used an AGENT of ANY sort. It's to remove liability and to act against another.",
