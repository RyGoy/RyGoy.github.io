   "message": "Could it not be either or?  If a corporation was formed for the heirs of the beneficiaries to take control of and be the shareholders of when the grantors of the trust are no longer here, then it would be a business trip...just part of doing business.  There are many possibilities that need to be investigated for the best places in which to invest for the heirs of the trust and forming a corporation that those heirs can one day be the shareholders of and control will need to thought out very carefully.  Canada is very RC friendly Gee states and so a business trip to determine if this part of the world has good investment property that would benefit the heirs of a trust in the future would be something that I am brainstorming.  Is that wrong?",
