   "message": "That's the legacy of THE TENDER FOR LAW. I want to hurt people who \"thank\" me or express gratitude.\n\nEven the lurkers who contact me privately, and \"thank me\" when they succeed, I want to hurt. These people did it.\n\nAndrew D' Spyder Pig was the worst offender, but know that whatever bullshit platitudes you come up with, ALL of these assholes said too. So if you feel the urge to \"Thank\" me, with some bullshit platitudes, just fucking keep it to yourself, because all you will be viewed as is these pieces of shit.\n\nWant to \"thank\" me? put one of these pieces of shit in the hospital.",
