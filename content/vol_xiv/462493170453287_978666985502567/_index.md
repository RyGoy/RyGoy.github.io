See if you can list all the \"grateful\" people who mean me harm. The Gail Marie Cunt is one so be sure to read this thread quickly. She'll delete the whole thing when she realizes it.\n\nIn the meantime see how many people in this thread now mean me harm",

   "description": "I can't find the thread where Scott mentioned that the banks exchange currency, so will start a new one to ask this. I want to be sure I comprehend this correctly. \n\n For example, a loan, our signature creates the credit, the bank exchanges the credit for legal tender....how would you describe what is backing our signature to give us the power to create the credit? I know the banks suggestion we are in the debtor category and that our labour is what pays off the loan, which isn't accurate,  is it the security of the person/birth certificate that is the backing of our signature?",
