   "message": "Well. It's been 30 days that I've posted notice for the owner of this bird to come claim her. I guess there are no claims to ownership. I will keep administrating this bird by giving her everything she needs. It seems like there should be a separate account that keeps track of this sort of thing so that the expenses incurred can be reimbursed.....or maybe I'm just a slave who has to give my money and time for free. \n\nThis bird is worth about $800 to buy. Someone I trust ha already spent that on her :D. It's gonna cost more than she is worth for someone to get her back. \n\n:D",
