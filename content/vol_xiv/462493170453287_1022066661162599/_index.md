   "message": "Sean O'Connell! What's your story?\n\nA few points to be aware of:\n\n1: We don't have much luck with Irish members. A statistical anomaly, I'm sure! Sadly the average Irishman who stumbles into here, tends to be a drunken duplicitous lying sack of shit.\n\n...but we will TRY to keep an open mind :D\n\n2: How did you find this group?  Please don't lie about it. (Irish has nothing to do with this point, even though they tend to be drunken duplicitous lying sacks of shit) Yes, people lie or simply refuse to tell us... so don't do that. Just tell us how you found us.",
