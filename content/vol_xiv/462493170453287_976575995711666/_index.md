   "message": "I realize I'm in charge of some powerful assets, and I also realize there appear to be a number of people that mean Scott Duncan harm.\n\nI looked at these assets that I control and asked myself, \"How can I help?\"  \n\nUnused domains, we point to private gateways, which means when Scott is teaching a lesson you can see the lesson live on the Internet (as though it's a production environment).   One of those unused domains is what is eventually going to be the Civil Disruption Domain.  It can't be resolved from the outside, but aquilae.cdd.com is a massive, sprawling network.  However, I'm just concerned about the gateway.  This particular gateway is connected to what's called a \"Honeypot\" network.  It is designed to be just insecure enough that a government won't be beaten by it.  This means there is lots of auditing on it as well.  I thought I'd do a few tests - simply compose a web address on cdd that doesn't exist (404).  Next I'd make the 404 page \"smart\".  I've replaced the 404 page on the cdd addresses with one that gives you an insight of just how much information you pass to a server EVERY time you connect.  \n\n...and now the purpose of this post.\n\nColm Griffin is, in fact, Facta sunt potentiora verbis.  Here's how I did the test.  Since Colm Griffin was still my \"friend\", I had the facility to \"message\" him.  I then made an attractive URL like, http://cdd.com/colm-griffin01 (or something like that), and then sent off each \"suspect\" a similarly compelling message such as, \"Have you seen this?\" with http://cdd.com/colm-is-smoe01...and you're off to the races.  All you have to do is look at the logs.\n\nBeing a knuckle-dragging, Irish git, the stupid twat-waffle decided clicking on this would be a really good idea!  Oh what an interesting thing we found.  For your consideration, here's a link to the actual logs, http://cdd.com/error_log.20160407123342.txt.  I added numbers to the ends of the URL's so we can tell the difference between the clicks from the messages, and the ones you'll inevitably do.  \n\nJoe-Smoe is of course, a quatloser. That's his address.\n\n173.252.x.x are Facebook's \"Edge\" servers. This is where device and sessions are generated. This contains a shitload of client data. Some of which you will see here.",
