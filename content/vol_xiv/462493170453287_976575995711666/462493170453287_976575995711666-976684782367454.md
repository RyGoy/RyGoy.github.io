   "message": "Well to reiterate what was said on the Sewer Thread (Yes, that's what we call it) Colm Griffin, as you mentioned in a sub-thread (I want it here so everyone sees it), I am absolutely convinced you are not this idiot.\n\nPlease forgive my ignorance. I did not understand what I was looking at. Scott Duncan always said LEARN THE STANDARDS FIRST. Everything on a computer network is standardized. I thought I could \"learn as I go\". It's how I did everything else. I was even warned ahead of time by a third party, that if I skip a step, I will fail. Well this is mine.\n\nNow I'm taking a crash course(s) in the standards. frown emoticon\n\nMy own arrogance and hubris caused me to make this false accusation against you, Colm. Forgive me, please. This is my fault. I didn't listen to Scott Duncan, and you paid the price.",
