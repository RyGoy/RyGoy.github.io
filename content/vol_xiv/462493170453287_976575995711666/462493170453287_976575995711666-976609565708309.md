   "message": "Anyone remember \"suil eile\"? He was a \"fan\" until I dared say something bad about Israel. He went into such an over-the-top snit about it, that my propaganda alarms went off!\n\nI mention this because he has a NATO ID! Yes he's a hired murderer! Paid with money taken by force from others!\n\nIf you are looking for suspects, compare what you KNOW with what you SEE. YOU asked why a DOD address was attached to him. He ran. Like all thieving cowards do.\n\nIsrael STILL doesn't have a right to exist, and there's no such thing as a \"palestinian terrorist\". Yes. I'm saying that the MUSLIMS in PALESTINE are NOT TERRORISTS. YES, Islam is an evil, Ignorant, Violent, Misogynist ideology...\n\n...and none of the ones in Palestine are terrorists.\n\nJUST SO MY POSITION IS CLEAR.",
