   "message": "Lou Manotti let me bring another angle. We know there is an attack on Scott Duncan (an his interest), and The Tender for Law. \n\nThey have tried to attack, with a laughable non-effect, at the legal side of the information Scott has shared. Now they are including Bitcoin. Cast doubts on Bitcoin, any technologies associated with that. It's so clear to me.\n\nUnfortunately for them, we also know more about the blockchain that they probably will ever know. Hahaha!",
