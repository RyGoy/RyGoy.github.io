   "message": "Mirabel, april 9th, 2016\n\nMIRABEL POLICE, by fax 450-475-7195\n\nAgent of the peace Badge #111\nAgent of the peace Badge #116\n\nCC : The Public\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nNotice of Fraud\n\nDear Agents of the peace Badge #111 and Badge #116\n\nI have good reasons to believe you both have been swindeled, on december 17th 2015, by Bailiff Agent of the Peace MARTIN MERCIER from Latraverse Huissier de Justice Inc, who requested your assistance at 13905, Latreille in St-Canut.\n\nI did notify you 2 days prior, by fax, and I did notify you again many times on that day, december 17th, 2015.\n\nSurely you�ll understand my surprise in regards to your inaction at this present time. It is difficult for me to understand why you are not getting busy ARRESTING that individual, you were ready to put cuffs on me, on december 17th, 2015, Agent of the Peace Badge #116 asserted it with no hesitation.\n\nListen, if your role here, in Mirabel is to assist dangerous criminals while they are STEALING from us, then I stand gaping.\n\nTake notice that I expect you to do the job for which we pay you.\n\nI�m not asking for anything too special, MARTIN MERCIER LIED to you on december 17th, 2015, with the intention to STEAL from me, that�s as simple as that. And MARTIN MERCIER entered our home, on october 8th, 2015, while we were absent, without my express or implied consent.\n\nYour Code of Ethics makes it clear at section 3.\nThe Quebec Charter is also clear about that, refer to section 8.\n\nIt seems �INTRO� is the word you use for that, isn�t it ?\n\nIf you remain inactive, I will have no other choice but to understand that your intentions are HOSTILE towards the public, and I will inform that very public of that.\n\nSurely you do know that I�m not one of those Sovereign Citizen kooks, I�m just a MAN with fundamental RIGHTS decreed by Her Majesty, with the advice and consent from the Assembl�e Nationale du Qu�bec. And I�m only trying to have those fundamental RIGHTS respected and exercised.\n\nDid you know, Qu�bec is the only province � and the only North-American jurisdiction � to have included economic and social rights in a fundamental law, the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. It takes precedence over all other laws.\n\nNow you know.\n\nKnow that I still TRUST you, and that trust still has not been BREACHED, and I refuse to listen to anyone else but YOU about this subject. Agent Badge #116 really disappointed me when she threatened me with putting chains on me and arresting me, but I have good reasons to believe that she did so with ignorance, and I won�t go crazy about that.\n\nI wish you do what is JUST, nothing more.\n\nOnce again, if the Charter has been voided and/or canceled, or if it simply was a joke, tell me so by writing and I promise I will refrain from trying to have those fundamental RIGHTS I have, respected. You know I always hold my PROMISES, don�t you ?\n\nI�m sorry that Ren� L�vesque gave us all that power when he wrote that Charter in 1975, I�m sorry that the Assembl�e Nationale du Qu�bec got it signed and enacted by Her Majesty, I am sorry that Ren� L�vesque refused to make us SLAVES, but that�s REALITY, and it�s not my FAULT.\n\nI accept and respect YOUR oath of office, if you have one, of course.\n\nTruely YOURS,\n\nBy :\nPierre, the man who possesses the juridical personnality named PIERRE DAOUST with inscription number 1196604112851. The juridical personnality which I possess is DOMICILED at 13905 Latreille, St-Canut, Qu�bec J7N 1N5.\n514-XXX-XXXX",
