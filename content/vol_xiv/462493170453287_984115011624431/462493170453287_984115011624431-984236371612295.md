   "message": "...seriously, I should have been dead a LONG time ago. I realized it, A LONG time ago. I'd beaten the odds, and my luck would run out sooner or later.\n\nI have goals. Most of you are far to ignorant to comprehend those goals, and I will be LONG dead before the world gets it, but the same was true about money, 3 years ago, and NOW you have a working and functional knowledge that you cannot UNLEARN! You can't.\n\n...unless you are a retard, like frisbey. Border-line retards can un-learn ANYTHING, because they don't actually learn anything. That's what makes them retards.\n\n...I digress.\n\nNo matter what, you will ALWAYS have bragging rights in the future. You were here when it all started.\n\n\"DO RIGHT BY ALEXANDER\"\n\nIt's the last clause of the FIRST MAGNA CARTA, which is indisputably the foundation of western civilization.\n\n...but a search returns NOTHING except a BBC Transcript, and HERE.\n\nTHE TENDER FOR LAW. That is TRUE, here, now. IN REALITY.\n\nIt sounds \"crazy\" but you can see for yourself.\n\nCall me all the names you like. Reality does not give a fuck.",
