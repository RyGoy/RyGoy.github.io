   "message": "This is the British Library English translation of the original document, the Magna Carta 1215. In English, Article 59 says:\n\n\"* (59) With regard to the return of the sisters and hostages of Alexander, king of Scotland, his liberties and his rights, we will treat him in the same way as our other barons of England, unless it appears from the charters that we hold from his father William, formerly king of Scotland, that he should be treated otherwise. This matter shall be resolved by the judgement of his equals in our court.\"\n\nIn Latin, it says:\n\n\"[59] Nos faciemus Alexandro regi Scottorum de sororibus suis, et obsidibus reddendis, et libertatibus suis, et iure suo, secundum formam in qua faciemus aliis baronibus nostris Anglie, nisi aliter esse debeat per cart{as} quas habemus de Willelmo patre ipsius, quondam rege Scottorum; et hoc er{it per} judicium parium suorum in curia nostra.\"\n\n- http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/magna-carta-1215\n\nNow try taking the original Latin text and running it through the translator of your choice. \n\nI'll wait...",
