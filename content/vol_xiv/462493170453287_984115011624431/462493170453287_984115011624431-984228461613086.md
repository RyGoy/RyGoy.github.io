   "message": "Here's the thing; Focusing on my VERY obscure title draws attention to shit that a LOT of very wealthy people paid a STUPIDLY large amount of money to hide.\n\nI encourage that, because it does TWO things:\n\n1: It (ONCE AGAIN will turn out I was telling the truth.\n\n2: Sewer & Rory will get the attention of some very annoyed people with money. I've played this one in the past (when it was much easier to obscure things) and it NEVER works out well for those who go chasing that shit.\n\nAs has already been pointed out; WHO CARES! THE TITLE MEANS NOTHING! It means some very silly things to some very silly people with too much wealth. That's it! It has ABSOLUTELY NO BEARING ON WHAT I TEACH HERE! NOTHING!\n\nI don't claim superiority because of some title given, because the right cocks, hit the right cunts, at the right time! I claim superiority because I'M BETTER.\n\nHow's THAT for \"crazy\"? :D",
