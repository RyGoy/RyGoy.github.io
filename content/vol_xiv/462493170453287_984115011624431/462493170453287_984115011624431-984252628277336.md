   "message": "While we're waiting, I'll post what Sewer Ellie is saying about me!\n\nFirst he pretends I \"blocked him\", which is a lie, I can post my block list any time. The Sewer has never been on it...\n\n...and why did he run away, like a little bitch? Well he underestimates the equipment I used, that's for sure!...but he brags about killing people for strangers and being paid with money taken by force, from others, and claims that makes him \"better\".\n\nAnd BECAUSE of Star Trek and my \"sega megadrive\", I am able to change EVERYTHING. A dumb thug who kills strangers for money and justifies it by saying the strangers are \"bad\".\n\nSeriously, how do I NOT claim superiority? I have set in motion, so many events, that will change EVERYTHING. Sewer has killing people for money...\n\n...I'M BETTER!\n\nAnd he's bitching about a fucking metaphor I used in a post! He omits that part, and tries to make it look like I \"support terrorists\".",
