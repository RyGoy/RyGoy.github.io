   "message": "He's just as much a product of the government as I am!\n\nHe lives off of money, taken by force from others, just like all of those attached to government. They are OK with that.\n\nI'm not.\n\nIt's why I get to claim to be BETTER, and have it be TRUE.\n\nAs an aside: COURTROOMS and FRISBEY are the same inasmuch as they are BOTH paid for by money taken by force from others.\n\nSo if you are IN a courtroom against your will, remember that. THE COURT and FRISBEY are the same. Treat them as such.",
