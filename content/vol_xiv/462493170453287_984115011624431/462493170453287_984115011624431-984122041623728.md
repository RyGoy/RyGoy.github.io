   "message": "Notice how he says I \"claim\" shit. I do no such thing. I TESTIFY. Pretending I'm \"crazy\" for it won't change reality.\n\nThen he outright lies and says I claim to be \"infallible\" (Note the Catholic Kiddie-diddler weasel-word there? The POPE claims \"infallibility\") which goes to that whole \"changing what I say\" thing. If you change what I say by using different words, YOU ARE LYING.\n\nSCOTT IS ALWAYS RIGHT is not \"infallibility\", it's a reference to HOW I'm \"always right\" and goes nicely with TRUST BUT VERIFY. He leaves those things out.\n\nAll to alter your BELIEF about me. Sewer Ellie MEANS YOU HARM. ANYONE lying about me MEANS YOU HARM.",
