   "message": "Over the past 3 years or so, \n\nI had lawyers run away when asked about surety and the birth certificate.\n\nI had a high ranked government employee, which apparently \"you cannot just call and ask to talk to\", put a big red note at the top of my person's file with them instructing their agents that when ME calls them, they transfer ME to her.\n\nThat same high ranked government employee stright out told me \"well you may have found out about something the government doesn't want you to know...\"\n\nI had the Bank of Canada kind of freak out when I said NO to \"You are a Bank of Canada employee, obviously ?\" and to \"Do you work with FINTRAC ?\" Then they refused to talk to me at all.\n\nI NEVER had any government employee tell me anything I learned from Scott was BS and that I should stop wasting their time with that stuff. It actually seems like they're scared and DONT WANT to talk to me... How's that for CRAZY !?\n\nThe bank manager recently told me \"Usually we can contact QRA and try to work things out and they cooperate with us, but when I called regarding your issue, they said they were not authorized to discuss...\"\n\n\"Crazy\" clearly shouldn't be so intimidating to all of them...",
