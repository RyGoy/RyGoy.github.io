   "message": "I think what they are saying, and why they are saying it, should be the focus. They are purposely lying, and there is a strong a motivation behind it. All these fake accounts, purposely lying, with the same themes. Why? Readers, please take note of this. Why do you think they go thru all this effort?\n\nWhat they do is so evidently shameful, that they avoid using their real names, because they want to avoid liability for what they are saying. Cowards with \"arts degrees\" that hide behind a license to commit crimes. \n\nIf they claim to have the truth, why hide? Should not they be proud of what they are doing? Scott Duncan is not hiding. Tara is not hiding. Pete Daoust is not hiding. We are all here.",
