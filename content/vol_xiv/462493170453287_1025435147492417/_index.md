   "message": "William Brewis!\n\nWhat's your story?\n\nWhy are you here? All the good stuff in this group happened years ago. All we do is make fun of new people now.\n\n...but you can avoid the ridicule of your intellectual, ethical and moral superiors, by TRUTHFULLY answering the following question!\n\nHow did you find this group?\n\n...and don't lie. The last guy literally said I \"advertised\" the group. He was a Piece-of-Shit Christian, so lies are to be expected, but this seems to be a subject people lie about for some reason.\n\nSo what's your answer? :D",
