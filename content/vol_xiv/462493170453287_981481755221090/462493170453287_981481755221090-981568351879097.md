   "message": "They ignore the rules now. I liened my name when they did it to me.\n\nSee, that's the irony! If they ignored the rules for all of you, and stuck with them with me, no matter what, then you'd never have heard of me. They were supposed to protect MY RIGHTS... MINE! ABOVE everyone else's. That was the deal. If they'd stuck with it, I would never have spoken up.\n\n...but they didn't, so I did. You're all caught up. :D\n\nI LIEN MY NAME because it's MINE. I'm ENTITLED to it, so I LEGALLY SECURE IT. Neither the Government nor the Law Society can ignore it, without tipping their hand, which will be published by force through everything that has an IP address, if necessary.\n\nI know EXACTLY the points to hit in the LEGAL MATRIX to bring all the pretense down.Pete Daoust is just VERIFYING that what I say is TRUE.",
