   "message": "When Boston Legal was aired, the system wasn't closed down, and there were writers who (with the help of the EFF) managed to make very compelling scripts.\n\nThis episode actually covers my infamous \"YOU PAID FOR THIS LAW, AND YOU DID NOT GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR\" position.\n\n \"YOU PAID FOR THIS LAW, AND YOU DID NOT GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR\" is how I respond to accusations of being a Free-Dumber.\n\nPeople's rights, and freedoms, are effectively ignored these days. Nobody cares. Show that they've been ripped off, though, and they get mad! ;)",
