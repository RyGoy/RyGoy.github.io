   "message": "Television networks and their regulators were only JUST noticing the internet as competition. As more people got their entertainment online, the demand for tv dropped.\n\nThe government, on the other hand, used it as a chance to implement POLICY through regulation and graft. CNN went from news source, to propaganda arm. It took a long time, but US news is CONTROLLED news. The last networks to hold onto the \"traditional values\", were starved out.\n\nPeople don't seem to realize that it's all a closed system, and THEY helped \"close\" it.",
