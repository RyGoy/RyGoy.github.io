   "message": "Once it finally dawned on me, if the government agencies are not willing to honor these Bills of Exchange, and if our person's rights are not been protected, then IN FACT the tender for law that money provides is FRAUD! \n\nSpoiler alert: Scott said from day one THAT was part of the purpose of The Tender for Law. To show the fraud behind fiat money, because money it's connected to \"law.\" We are paying for these \"laws\" with our lives, and we are not getting what we paid for. :/",
