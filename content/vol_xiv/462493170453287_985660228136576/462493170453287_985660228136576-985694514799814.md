   "message": "I can just see the quatlosers looking at it and Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson getting excited because it's below 7 billion and then suddenly... *Blip* Over it goes! :D\n\n...because he'd try to sell \"It's less than 7 billion! It's only 699.9 billion!\" as if that means anything.\n\nDan Lien-Your-Name Wilson actually proposed \"Whut if all duh compooters and duh innernets go down! Where will your money be then!\". and you just know there are people who think \"Hey yeah! He's right! Money will be my first concern if that happens\"... No wait, that's not how reality works.\n\nDan Lien-Your Name Wilson. New readers might wonder why we say Dan \"Lien-Your-Name\" Wilson. We do that because \"Dan Wilson\" is a Law Society Bitch. He doesn't like what I tell you, ESPECIALLY about LIENING YOUR NAME. He deletes the posts, but the lies he tells to try stop you from doing that, are astounding.\n\nI think we need to focus more on that. When it's ready, we will have everything you need to do it.\n\nIt won't be on Facebook. When it's done, you will be astounded. It's been under construction since 1999. With a full PUBLIC record.\n\nUntil then, read this :D\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/scott-duncan/the-tender-for-law-lien-your-name-c-2015-roguesupport-inc/1225577444175392",
