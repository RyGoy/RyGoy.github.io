   "message": "While Sewer Ellie, Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson, and the Quatlosers lie about me, I'd like to draw your attention to a bit of REALITY:\n\nBITCOIN JUST CROSSED THE SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR MARKET CAP.\n\nhttp://coincap.io/\n\nSo remember that it doesn't matter what they say. It doesn't matter what they THINK! It doesn't matter what they \"believe\"...\n\nReality has ZERO fucks to give.\n\n...and this is just a PIECE. I'd explain the whole thing, but I've had my fill of worthless parasitic non-contributing worthless ZEROS with \"arts degrees\" lying and calling me \"crazy\".\n\nYes, I'm bat-shit insane. I accept that, and under your \"arts degree\" rules, that means I'm not criminally accountable for my actions. Remember that when my girls come for your eyes and thumbs.\n\n...I digress. This is a day of celebration! See the REALITY defy the magic parchments from \"Arts Degrees\".\n\nIt's quite clear what's being said by REALITY; WE ARE COMING.\n\nPretending it's not true won't change that.\n\nCryptocurrencies, and personal banks? That's NOTHING. That is POCKET CHANGE. LITERALLY. Yes, money is now controlled by the people who use it, but that's just to give you a bit of leeway.\n\nCivil Disruption is my next goal. They are deploying technology to control you and it's costing them (Banks/Government) BILLIONS.\n\n...and for every BILLION DOLLAR TOOL, I'll show you how to defeat it for less than $100. \n\nThe half-finished stuff of these past three years, are being finished.\n\nI showed you how to replace MONEY, and now it's time to REPLACE INTERNET.\n\nBut that's for tomorrow. TODAY we celebrate. SEVEN FUCKING BILLION MARKET CAP! \n\nAnd what is yet to come?\n\nBitcoin is a FAILED experiment. Let that sink in. This is a FAILURE with spectacular results. Vitalik Buterin has turned the blockchain into what it was meant to be. It's AMAZING. ...fuck I hate that kid :P\n\nSeriously, though; Vitalik Buterin is somebody who's half my age, twice my intellect and 3 times more ambitious than I EVER was. He's who you want to pay attention to. He has an agenda too, and I think you will like what he has in mind. He is rewarding those who took the risks with him, and he's already got a foothold in Microsoft... He's not even 30. Think like him.\n\n...I digress.\n\nSEVEN FUCKING BILLION! :D\n\n#ScottIsALWAYSright",
