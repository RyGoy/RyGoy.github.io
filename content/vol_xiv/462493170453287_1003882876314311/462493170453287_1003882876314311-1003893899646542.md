   "message": "Exposure to trauma, violence and disturbing events:\n\nReality is that as a police officer, you will be exposed to trauma, violence and disturbing situations. But it's important to remember that you are there to help, to provide protection and support in difficult times. Just as it's important to maintain your physical health, it is critical to maintain mental wellness throughout your life and we have programs in place to teach you how to do that, and to provide any support needed.\n\nDespite all this, it will eventually become clear that it has nothing to do with \"safety\", and you are simply an armed thug.",
