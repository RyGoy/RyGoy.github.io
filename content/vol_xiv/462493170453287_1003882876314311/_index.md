   "message": "I think they should make me a Provost Marshall.\n\nHalf of these redcoats would get a bullet to the head. Soldiers do that shit without question! (They're just doing their jobs)That would open up EVEN MORE jobs.\n\nAll future hires would be NON UNION. Preference would be given to natives. :D\n\nA Royal Appointment would be all it took!\n\nI could clean up the country in a year! Being a Police Officer would be an honour again, and people will strive to meet the standards.\n\n...alas, this will never happen.\n\nHere in REALITY, the RCMP is looking for dumb thugs to collect revenue for people who couldn't get a job in the real world.",
