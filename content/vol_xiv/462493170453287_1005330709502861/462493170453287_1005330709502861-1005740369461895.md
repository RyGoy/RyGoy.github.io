   "message": "So if you're still at a \"MAYBE,\" what is this \"enough people\" statistic you're looking for?  If there are 74 members of the group, and if my math hat is on, the majority needs three more YES votes, and that's not counting Pete's alter ego!  Lol.  But, since you're determining the rules, what is this \"enough\" you're looking for?  Can my PERSON vote too?  If so, she has a YES vote also.  My PERSON'S PERSON wants to vote too.  That would be another YES!",
