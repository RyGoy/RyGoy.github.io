   "message": "Yes, it's very strange. Scott Duncan teaches to ASK question. The RIGHT questions.\n\nIt's not like it's complicated or anything like that :/\n\nHe invited me to learn some basics....not HIS beliefs but some BASIC legal bullshit....\n\nThen he invited me to learn what MONEY is......not HIS view on it but what it actually is in the LEGAL system we live in.\n\nAnd then he invited me to THINK. To stop the BULLSHIT and just THINK, fuck, the THINKING part was the longest. From all the time I have used, 80% of it was used to THINK...\n\nAnd then, eventually, the RIGHT questions came up. And trust me, it really was the RIGHT questions :D\n\nI don't get why all these idiots gets all butt-hurts about Scott Duncan, this is a great mystery to me :/",
