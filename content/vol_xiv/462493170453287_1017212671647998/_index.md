   "message": "Friday morning, i went to Pete�s meeting. 9:02h, I�m fukin late cause i missed the train... well didn�t missed it, he came on the wrong track, i came close but i missed it on the opposite track... the train left in front of my eyes; so i had to take a bus.... much slower!  :( I enter the court room, seems chill. I look around. I see the back of Pete�s Head.... i�m at the right place! :)  So i sit down!  Then the judge arrives seconds later, i must stand up, like the others (i guess!?!). My first time in more than 20 years in that kind of places, i don�t really remember the last time and i don�t want to make any troubles so i do as they do.... i feel like i�m at the church when i was a young child..... sit down, get up, sit down.... on your knees, sing a song!!!  :/\nThey are calling the cases by numbers... Pete�s case is one of the lasts ones. They (The judge, The lawyer and Pete) talked a little bit about an affidavit from Ville de Terrebonne that came on the late and the judge send them outside to talk in some ��private room�� and try to set the case. I follow Pete and his friends. They got close to a room that seems to fit them so i sit close to it. Pete and the lawyer get in the room but there�s some trouble as they enter the room; Pete�s witnesses can�t enter the room! I see some ��fighting�� to close the door from the inside and open it from the outside! Finally Pete and the lawyer exit the room and i hear the lawyer saying: ��There's nothing i can do if you don�t want to talk�� And Pete answering something like: ��I WANT to talk to you. We�ll do it right here (in public) if my witnesses can�t enter the room, i have no problem with that.�� Finally they all (but me) enter the room; Pete, the lawyer and two other dudes. Few minutes later the lawyer get out of the ��private room�� mumbling something i can�t hear but he look pissed and he�s kind of reddish!! Pete and the 2 other dude get out as well and they all get back to the court room... i follow them! \nSecond round. Pretty much all the cases are being set easily. All�s seems to get going very well... then come Pete�s turn! They are saying that the little chat in the ��private room�� didn�t had any beneficial effect to set the case. Pete wants the original BoE, the lawyer don�t have them. Reason: they digitized them so they didn�t kept the originals!\nThere�s 2 cases that needs some special attention from the judge, Pete�s is one of them. He�s going last when there�s nobody else left in the room besides me, the 2 other dudes that get inside the ��private room�� with Pete earlier and a girl!?! Oh wait, there�s also a peace officer that appeared as soon as Pete went to front of the room to speak with the judge. This peace officer at first stayed in the back of the room, observed everyone in the room and took notes then he move a little foward to sit down. I stayed in the back; i�m the officer�s dead angle. During all the meeting, this officer paid a special attention to the 2 dudes that were with Pete sitting in the front of the room. When one of them looked at his phone during the argumentation, he went very suspicious, looking like he was about to jump on him!\nThe argumentation tomorrow.... there's some crazy stuf in there, i really liked when the lawyer refers to the SURETY of the PERSON as it was the SECURITY OF HIS RIGHTS(!?!?!)  ...but i need to sleep now!!",
