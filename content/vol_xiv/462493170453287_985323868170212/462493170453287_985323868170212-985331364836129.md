   "message": "He was asked : with WHOM is the contract being signed with? You say world citizen, but we live on a planet called earth? And another along the lines of 'what do you mean by citizen? We are humans with citizenships.'...ken no likey...ken cut him off and got pretty emotional about be questioned.   oooOoOooOOo please please help me with this one. It's 12$ to have this contract 'written up'. When i slammed the numbers together, he's looking at 12 000 000 (based on the amount of peeps he wants to join this thing)...som someone asked: what r u going to do with 12 million? Annnnnnnd that's when it sealed the deal for me, these lawyers got him good: the 12 mil is for the defense fund, if anyone and/or city encounters issues throughout this process?? ....i have reason to believe ANY process handled by an 'artist' will take every penny out of that defense fund. And the 'victims' will not win in court.",
