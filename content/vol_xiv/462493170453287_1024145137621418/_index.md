   "message": "Pete Daoust does ACTUAL RESEARCH. He trusts what I say, but he VERIFIES it.\n\nReading clubhouse rules, for a club you aren't a member of, is NOT RESEARCH.\n\nVERIFYING what I say, IS RESEARCH.\n\nI TRUST Elon Musk's knowledge, skill, and vision, but I ALSO have knowledge. Knowledge that exceeds his, in many areas. He does a lot of scary hypothesis regarding A.I.  He even says he's \"done the research\".\n\nThat just means he doesn't know how a fucking computer works.\n\nAll the \"Googling\" in the world won't make it \"research\".\n\nNote: Chaining a lawyer to a chair and extracting answers with a blow-torch, is good research. :D Tell them I said hi.",
