   "message": "<< ALIENATE, aliene, alien. This is a generic term applicable to the various methods of transferring property from one person to another. Lord Coke, says, (1 Inst. 118 b,) alien cometh of the verb alienate, that is, alienum facere vel ex nostro dominio in alienum trawferre sive rem aliquam in dominium alterius transferre. These methods vary, according to the nature of the property to be conveyed and the particular objects the conveyance is designed to accomplish. It has been held, that under a prohibition to alienate, long leases are comprehended.>>\n\nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/alienate",
