   "message": "Surety of the person is a fundamental right here, in Quï¿½bec. City of Terrebonne seems to have no problems spending PUBLIC funds to commit this fraud, also the JUSTICE seems to have no problems ASSISTING them in this fraud, using PUBLIC funds.\n\nSo I see no problems using this surety so this AGENT could benefit from it, right? :/\n\nAgain, I have proofs of what is being said here :/",
