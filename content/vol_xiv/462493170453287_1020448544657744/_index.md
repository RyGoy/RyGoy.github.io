   "message": "I have a \"NEW\" question :D\n\nSo, FORENSIC ACCOUNTING is neededï¿½..\n\nTwo bills of exchange were sent to City of Terrebonne in order for two debts to be discharged.\n\nThese two bills of exchange were sent Feb. the 16th 2015 via Registered mail RW970279860CA.\n\nThey were received by City of Terrebonne, stapled to a Notice, notifying what I do, how I do it and why I am doing it. There was also a birth certificate stapled to them, and an act of birth.\n\nThe Notice also notified City of Terrebonne that if these two bills of exchange were to be refused, to just send them back and that I would PAY.\n\nI have no idea WHO opened this envelop, and the only information I have so far is that these two bills of exchange were disposed of.\n\nNo one wants to tell me where, no one wants to RETURN them to me, and City of Terrebonne still want me to PAY these debts.\n\nI have tried everything I could to have them back, and promised numerous times that I would PAY if these were to be refused and returned.\n\nI can only believe that FRAUD is being committed, in the name of the SOVEREIGN. Again, I also have proofs (signed) that City of Terrebonne is doing all this in the name of the SOVEREIGN.\n\nI have asked WHO was this Sovereign, and no answers came back.\n\nThe ONLY Sovereign I know of is Her Majesty the Queen.\n\nSince FRAUD seems to be committed by City of Terrebonne, I have good reasons to believe that an AGENT should investigate this matter. I can no longer communicate with City of Terrebonne's lawyers because I can't participate to this FRAUD.\n\nIf such AGENT would like to take this matter to hand, what exactly does this AGENT needs from me?\n\nThanks\nPete.",
