   "message": "It's pretty convenient for the Law Society to pay money (they have plenty, and this would cost peanuts) to a few morons to do this. That way, they do not expose many attorneys directly, and still carry out their campaign. \n\nWhy would ALL these folks, all of the sudden, make a concerted effort to smear Scott Duncan/TTFL, with specific targets (BoE, Liens, etc), just because they are butthurt? :/",
