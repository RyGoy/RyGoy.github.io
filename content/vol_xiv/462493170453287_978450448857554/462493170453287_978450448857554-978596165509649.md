I don't know anything about him.\nJust for the record, my administration process has worked so far. I sent a Local Property Tax BOE to the revenue in August 2014. They no longer want the LPT from Mr.Lee Edgely but from my wife. So I have to remove surety from her legal entity. \nThey still have that BOE.",
