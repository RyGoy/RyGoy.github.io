   "message": "Let this sink in. What I am saying is true.\n\nI UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS. ALL OF IT. You could place me ANYWHERE on this map, and I will know more than the most accomplished lawyer in the region. \n\nThe biggest mistake lawyers make, is that they don't think that's true. As always, don't waste time figuring out IF it's true, figure out WHY it's true. A LOT of time is saved doing that. It's a waste of time figuring out IF it's true, because the answer is ALWAYS YES, and you don't get that time back!",
