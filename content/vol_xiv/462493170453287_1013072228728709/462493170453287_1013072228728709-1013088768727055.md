   "message": "When dealing with this sort of rebuttal, always picture it as if a LAWYER is saying it, because they (as useful idiots) are acting as agent for lawyers/Law Society.\n\nTHE LAWYER LIE: EVERY Lawyer does what these guys are doing; LYING about which definition applies.\n\nWhen you get hit with either the \"Mythology\" and/or \"Etymology\" crap, remember that IT'S ONLY THE LEGAL DEFINITION THAT GOVERNMENT AND COURTS RECOGNIZE. NOTHING these idiots say/think/feel/believe will EVER change that reality.\n\nONLY THE LEGAL DEFINITION APPLIES! \n\nIS IT GOVERNMENT SAYING \"UNDERSTAND\"? ONLY THE LEGAL DEFINITION APPLIES.\n\nIS IT LAWYERS SAYING \"UNDERSTAND\"? ONLY THE LEGAL DEFINITION APPLIES.\n\nIS IT BANKS SAYING \"UNDERSTAND\"? ONLY THE LEGAL DEFINITION APPLIES.\n\nONLY THE LEGAL DEFINITION APPLIES! \n\nAlso: ONLY THE LEGAL DEFINITION APPLIES!",
