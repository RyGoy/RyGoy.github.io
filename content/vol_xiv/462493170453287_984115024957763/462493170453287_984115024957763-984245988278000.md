   "message": "These people literaly invent lies about me so they have a pretend reason to be mad. They all hate that I'm right. They INVENT  \"victims\" because they can't find any real ones, and the irony is that the ONLY time I EVER had to lie was when I was serving the government of the Law Society.\n\nYou want a record of all the lies I've told, ASK THE FUCKING ATTORNEY GENERAL!",
