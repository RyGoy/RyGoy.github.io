   "message": "It's a numbers game to these pieces of shit.  Lame attempts to isolate your activity thru ad hominem attacks and appeals to authority.  Slippery shit rope to hang himself.  It's like a revolving door of piece of shit agents.  The question I keep asking myself is what triggered this response from Ireland.  Dan Wilson was a Canadian piece of shit response.  Now this is an Irish jurisdiction piece of shit response.  What was the trigger that made piece of shit handlers order agents to incite this???",
