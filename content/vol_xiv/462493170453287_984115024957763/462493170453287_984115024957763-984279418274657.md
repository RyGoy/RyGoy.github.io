   "message": "What's MOST \"disturbing\" is that EVERY ONE of you will do the same thing one day. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.\n\nIt doesn't matter who you are, and you will all invent unique reasons to copy the Spyder-Pig. Anything you might say to the contrary, was spoken, already BY the Spyder-Pig.\n\n...and it's lurking inside ALL of you, from the Fender, to Menard. You all have a lie in place to justify your disgusting actions,and it's ready to go when you need it. You are ALL the same from my vantage point.\n\nNext I'm going to build up the ZeroNet, and join it to I2p.\n\nWhen I have a web server that can't be turned off, I will publish \"secrets\". Secrets that can be VERIFIED.\n\nTHAT'S when I will harm people. I intend to have a LOT of \"victims\", and I am NOT hiding it.",
