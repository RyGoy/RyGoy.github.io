   "message": "Idiots are incapable of committing crimes, or entering into contracts? I don't think thats going to work! But,�what evidence does this court have that I have any SURETY in this matter?�, and �by what authority does this court attach ANY name derived from a PUBLIC DOCUMENT to me? Or if you are in court against your will you might find it useful to demand proof that the government has STANDING as a PRIVATE PERSON.  This also applies in the UNITED STATES.  If the court refuses to provide proof, INFORM the court that you intend to offer as PROOF FOR APPEAL an objection to this presumption of \"PERSONHOOD\" that the court has arbitrarily granted the government, and a demand for $1,000,000 SECURITY FOR COSTS.",
