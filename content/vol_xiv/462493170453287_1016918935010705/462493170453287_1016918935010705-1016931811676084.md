   "message": "I'm broke now, family and friends are gone, can't fight back like I need too, been fighting since 2012. Put a lawsuit in around 2014 that wasn't done wright, and have been unlawfully incarcerated twice now for 3 months at a time. Second time I was going to my date assignment to see if it was actually cancelled, and to file a motion to seek leave of two justices of the supreme  court. And they incarcerated me using automatic weapons! I have mental disorder's that my doctor's have back me saying, that it was caused by the justice system in EDM, and now the justice system in NS where/are pulling triggers of my illness! I tried to learn everything I could as I went along losing many court case's, but found out how they do business! But it never seemed to be enough, or put in properlyï¿½",
