   "message": "A man with nothing to lose, and the ability to fight back. I'm pissed off and ready to kill. I pay music very well, I worked out west in the oil patch, on oil rigs, and then I was a class one truck drive in the bush, then I was working on my mobile crane/boom truck ticket. Shortly after, I got locked up for 6 months in the old EDM remand centre, and got bet down by the guards, to witch I now have my injuries, in my neck, back and arms, and suffer from PTSD and all the lovely things that come's with it.",
