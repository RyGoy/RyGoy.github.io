   "message": "Pete, I don't know the details of why you have such animosity toward Steph Boucher...and I don't care, really.\n\nKeep in mind that YOU have done far more than him, and you have seen things he hasn't. These are just \"stories\" to him. \n\nMost group members have been victimized by law society scum, in some way, and they read my writing in their larger quest to understand.\n\nThe Idea that I'm the ONLY ONE who tells the truth about these things, is a hard reality to accept.\n\nHe's not where you are. If he was, he'd be at the point where people he's known for years are suddenly offensive at the cellular level, like you experience now. THIS is part of what was stolen from ALL of you.\n\nHe's trying to maintain ties to \"friends\" whilst foolishly thinking he can \"move forward\". He TRULY does not understand your rage. Sadly, if/when he does, he will feel worse, and very stupid.\n\nYou were once where he is (Albeit for a relatively short time), so you have a common experience, but he has \"belief\" still.\n\nYou won't oppose your \"friends\" with \"belief\", only with knowledge.\n\nHe only BELIEVES what I say is true. You KNOW.\n\nThat makes a huge difference, that he cannot see. He's actually quite dumbfounded that you are so mad, and is incapable of grasping why...and it's not his fault.",
