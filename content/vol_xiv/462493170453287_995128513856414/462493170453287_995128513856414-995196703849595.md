   "message": "I'm thinking create your own record...place a notice in the public records of a newspaper...do an affidavit and have your parents witness or other relatives who have first hand knowledge of the facts...have the affidavit notarized and file in the county you were born in...might also buy a family bible and record all births, deaths, marriages, etc...lots of possibilities to create your own record...something we all should do to extricate ourselves from their system. I'm also thinking using the word born vs birth ie: born date or date of incarnation so as not to confuse with their \"berth\" nonsense...",
