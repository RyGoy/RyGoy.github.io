   "message": "Starting a new thread because I didn't want the comment thread on my other post to go completely of topic. \n\nHere is my situation; some time in 2014 my birth certificate vanished from existence. None of the official recording agencies have it. The register of deeds in the county I was born does not have it. They had it previously because I had to get a copy of it for a state license in 2007. The hospital I was born in has no record because the records room their microfiche was stored in caught fire total loss. The NORTH CAROLINA VITAL STATISTICS does not have any record in their vault. I searched in nearby counties on the off chance there may have been a records transfer error. Nothing. \n\nMy question is what do I do to prove I am who I am? All of the state issued credentials I have expire in the next 15 months. I have old military ID's, and old military credentials when I was a contractor, and a current until next year driver's license. I do not have the physical social security card though I am familiar with the number.\n\nMaybe it is a non-issue and I am concerned for no good reason. At the moment it is puzzling.",
