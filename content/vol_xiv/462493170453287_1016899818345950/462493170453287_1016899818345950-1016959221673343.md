This experience is something no one can Bullshit n say oh I know what you talking about, cause my friend unless you have been in my shows and/or fought this kind of fight then my FRIEND you have no clue. One can only and should only talk from experience. At least in my lifetime I have accomplished something really huge against and even larger  opponent. Some will defend their beliefs of the system and say oh well you shouldn't have gotten in trouble or broken the law or whatever.. Brother it's so easy to fall into the hole .. the system is made that way. All the Bullshit statues n codes are contracts. Everything is by your CONSENT..AND UNDERSTANDING!",
