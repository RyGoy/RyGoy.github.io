   "message": "My mother, Neens Jean used the Notice of Mistake to get my brother out of prison. Since then Chris Evan has been teaching us about surety and accounting. Strangers on the internet have given us a chance at life, free from slavery. People we will never meet, have changed our lives. I wish my brother would listen to us, he claims this is all bullshit.
