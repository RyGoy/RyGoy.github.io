   "message": "Yes so true.. I have posted this and other material on facebook and hardly get any likes except from the same friends who are also part of this AMAZING GROUP.. BUT if I put whatever Bullshit the likes n comments plus shares are many to say the least. So sad but true and plus it's lonely knowing the truth.. so hard to find people to relate too and/or have a real deep conversation with. They call me crazy and or he's just lucky. LUCKY my ass.. Luck nor God or prayers from people freed me from this, Only the truth did and always will...THE NOTICE OF MISTAKE.. SURETY & ACCOUNTING.. nothing else.",
