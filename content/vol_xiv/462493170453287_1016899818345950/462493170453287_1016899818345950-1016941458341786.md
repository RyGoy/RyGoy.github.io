   "message": "My best advice is stand your ground .. you will be scared but dont let fear get the best of you.. I was so scared this last time I was even considered getting a lawyer and almost attorned. The best weapon is the element of surpise.. fuck sending it in and dealing in private they don't follow the rules.. only present it on Mandatory docketing.. right before the trial. That way the STATE is not prepared for you. They won't leave you for last so that they are no witnesses left in the courtroom.. this case continued cause that the beginning of the case they were ready for me and I had no witnesses and they saved me for last . Then after they put out a warrant for my arrest cause they said I did not appear. That causes me to get kidnapped again thrown in cell and then had to pay another bond to get out and have to check in every fucking Monday like a good slave... Fucking Bastards.. and steeple who swear n think they are doing right and/or I'm just doing my job.",
