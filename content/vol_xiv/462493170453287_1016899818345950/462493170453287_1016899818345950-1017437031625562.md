   "message": "Eamonn, your interrogative makes too many presumptions.\n\nThere is a TENDER FOR \"LEGAL\" attached to money. If you are GIVEN a $20 bill and then told 6 weeks later that you have to suck my dick because you Possessed that 20 dollar bill, you would suddenly be saying \"go fuck yourself! I didn't consent to that\". You wouldn't be saying \"What facts or evidence is there for any warrant of agency for the principal\".\n\nMake it more basic. Focus on REALITY. Pretending to be a lawyer is useful if you are auditioning for a role on television/movies, but here in real life, it does nothing but serve the Law Society, and screw you over.\n\nWhen you talk in court, like a lawyer, and you are RIGHT, the court knows they are being spoken to by someone else.\n\nIt's why \"Scott Duncan says Hi\" is such a scary *mic drop*.\n\nFocus on reality. \"what facts or evidence is there for any warrant of agency for the principal\" is NOT something you would EVER say to anyone outside a courtroom. If you did, you'd receive many requests to cease and desist being such a faggot. :P",
