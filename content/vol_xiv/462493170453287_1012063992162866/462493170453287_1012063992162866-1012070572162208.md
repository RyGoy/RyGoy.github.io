   "message": "Hmm, well I got an invite? \n\nI'm not sure that's a good question, I guess I was just biding my time, increasing my knowledge so when I showed up here I wouldn't look 100% stupid, just 99%. \n\nBut yeah I don't know honestly I could have asked, in fact I was a member here three years ago. \n\nBut I was right before this group went private and I had not a clue about law or anything. \n\nDidn't know who to follow or what to read so when this group disappeared and left myself behind I didn't even realize what I was missing. Then when I found TTFL, ... \n\nI don't know... 7 months ago give or take, I started catching up on the reading and what I've missed for years. \n\nThat's also where I discovered ethereum right before it was released and realized you guys knew what the fuck you were talking about.\n\n:P",
