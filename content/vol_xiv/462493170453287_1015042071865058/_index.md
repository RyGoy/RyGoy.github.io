   "message": "Scott's teachings saves a child, and a family from being destroyed by the Law Society, and Family and Children Dept.\n\nSome good friends of mine that have been listening to what I bring them from the Tender for Law (for over 2 years now), were compelled to appear to an interview at the prosecutor's office, under the thread of contempt, after an incident caused by a rumor from neighbors. The mother of the child was called as a WITNESS for the State, of course, to use her TESTIMONY as EVIDENCE against the father, and her. \n\nFor days vans, personnel from Family and Child Dept,. and police have been going to the house every day, trying to interview them, but they wisely declined every invitation with \"I am not authorized to answer any questions,\" and then just leave, and kept minding their own business. \"Authorities\" did not like that, so they issued that invitation, under the thread of contempt to answer questions.\n\nAlthough they had been advised by a lawyer to go in there and answer questions, and give them \"as little as they could\" (whatever that means), they took the wise teachings of Scott to NEVER answer questions, and give them questions.\n\nSo the mother walked into the prosecutor's office, and shitting in her pants she repeated like a mantra \"I am not authorized to answer any questions. I do not understand the nature, and cause of these proceedings. Have I made my wishes clear?\" She said she repeated this so much, even the prosecutors would chant it with her. They mocked her, told her that as a witness she did not have a right not to answer questions, threaten her, bullied her. She said it was humiliating.\n\nThen they asked her to sign a DECLARATION. At that point she called me on the phone, and I told her to NEVER give her signature to anything they give her. While all this was happening, the Family and Child Dept. had a van, and personnel in front of the house where they thought the child was. Waiting in stand-by.\n\nShe told them she did not wish to sign any declaration, and asked if she was free to go. After hours of being there, they replied she did not have to sign if it was not her wish, and that she was free to go.\n\nAs soon as that happened, the van, and personnel left their house. That was 2 weeks ago. They haven't received more phone calls, or visits. Everything stopped. They have their kid, and are happy.\n\nSilence is GOLDEN. NEVER answer questions. Don't be like David-Paul Sip.",
