   "message": "If Martin is on my friends list, he is from legal deception.\nI added a couple people from there, then I stopped because they all think I have answers, when I don't.\nI used to be very mad, but being mad doesn't help me.\nI never said I didn't want to pay a debt.  I was pissed that they didn't send me a proper bill when I asked.\nThis is not about a Bell debt.   I spoke with Bell again today and they would send a proper bill.",
