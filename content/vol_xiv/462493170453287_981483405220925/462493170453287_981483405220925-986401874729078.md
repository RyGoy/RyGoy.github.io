   "message": "Scott: Your comment about me running before learning to walk is quite accurate.  I have been trying to play catch up.   I read and read and read, but I don't stop and take the time to absorb what I'm reading, so it ends up being time wasted.\n\nHopefully Anibal, you can help me slow down and focus on one thing at a time.\n\nSince I am starting from the beginning again, I should go back to Scott's articles, but this time, read only one at a time and then reread it.",
