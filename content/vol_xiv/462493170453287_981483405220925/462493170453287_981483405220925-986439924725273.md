   "message": "Remember, MONEY means LEGAL. And LEGAL is SURETY and ACCOUNTING. It's ALL about the MONEY. \n\nThis is not the definition of money of exchange and money of account, rather a simple explanation of their mechanics.\n\nMONEY OF EXCHANGE, is money you have the BENEFIT of using WITHOUT being SURETY for the it. For example, a $20 dollar bill. Your signature is NOT on it, right?\n\nMONEY OF ACCOUNT is money you have the benefit of using, but YOU ARE SURETY for it. Like a CHECK, or a CREDIT CARD, you must SING to use, so YOU become SURETY for that money.",
