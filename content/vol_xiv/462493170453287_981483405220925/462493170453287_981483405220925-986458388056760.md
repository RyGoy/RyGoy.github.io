   "message": "Ok, so now that you know that MONEY is DEBT IN TRANSIT, and that MONEY = LEGAL, and LEGAL = SURETY and ACCOUNTING, when CHARGES are created in court, a DEBT is been created. That is ALL that is happening in reality. \n\nALL you want to be concerned about in \"law\" is: if CHARGES = DEBT, you want to find where is the SURETY for that DEBT. Who is the responsible party to either PAY or DISCHARGE that DEBT? That is ALL \"law\" you need to be concerned about.\n\nDo you get that? Everybody get that?",
