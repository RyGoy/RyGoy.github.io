   "message": "So you wanted to avoid paying a Bell debt. You have Martin Sutton on your facebook friendlist.\n\nYou want to fully cooperate in here, you don't seems to be mad at all.\n\nYou're ready to flush everything you've learned and start from scratch.\n\nYou are a very special kind of fucktard from what I have seen so far :D\n\nI was mad when I joined the Tender for Law and was looking for answers. I was the most ignorant/fucktard in here.\n\nI am having a hard time believing you want to invest all this time for a Bell debt :D\n\nSorry, I suspect you being a something else than a fucktard :P",
