   "message": "Thank you Pete.  You pointed me in the direction of TTFL back in mid December.  Either Chris or Kent pointed me to the files section and Scott's gold nuggets.\n\nThe first 3 months I spent about 10 hours a day going back through all the posts.\n\nI was taking too much in and not giving my brain a chance to absorb what I was reading.\n\nI'm still spending a fair amount of time going through the posts and comments.  But now, taking breaks and then coming back, I find things are starting to stand out.  \n\nI've been getting frustrated lately because there are some posts where ideas are started, but not finished in the posts or there are multiple directions that are not quite clear to me.  \n\nI would much rather ask for clarification in the posts, than to message any of the members, as I know you all get bombarded with questions in your inboxes.\n\nagain... thank you for allowing me to join.",
