   "message": "This was my thought process.\n\nI have asked for services, and I have always paid.\nIf I buy something, I pay for it.\nI did not know that I was buying back debt until I read it on TTFL\nI don't have to buy back debt if I don't want to.\nI have the option to buy back the debt or discharge it.\nI am not yet ready to start discharging debts, but wanted to prepare\nby having Bell send me bills instead of paying online.\nMy intention is to pay, I was just offended that they sent a \"copy\" instead of sending a bill, and I started thinking the wrong things.\nI posted my thoughts here in order to have constructive feedback, because I wasn't thinking clearly  and I didn't want to do something stupid.\n\nFrom Pete's example with hydro.\nPete has the option to buy back the debt and let hydro have the remittance or he can discharge the debt as authorized administrator for PIERRE DAOUST.\n9111-1111 can buy the debt.\n\nThey are asking me to buy this debt.\nI don't want to buy this debt.  This debt was sent to my person.\n\nSince I haven't had the means to get my notices sent out, my plan was to get proper bills/invoices and continue to pay until I am able to discharge.  My goal is to be prepared for when I do start taking charge.\n\nThis was my thought process.\n\nI now have the means to get the notices done, as well as creating a corporation.\n\nI do understand that if I buy something I must pay, and that if I choose not to buy something, I don't have to pay.\n\nI have to process the words I use and choose them carefully.\nI'm still stuck on the common meaning most of the time.\n\nI got this far then had to run out for a bit.\n\nI thought I was understanding what I was reading, but not so sure now.\n\nIt is my persons account, so my person is the one receiving the benefit.  I just have use of it.\n\nI am not a person, I have a person, and as the administrator, I am supposed to be able to use the security of the person to settle things.  \nI know I have to notify the government and Bank of Canada about using the security of the person and asking if I am correct.\n\nWhen I get an invoice I turn the remittance part into a BOE, endorse it and send instructions stating that it is a BOE and where to send it in order to have it discharged.\n\nusing legal tender is paying debt with debt\n\nI think I complicated things here by not being clear in my intentions and using the wrong words.\n\nI thought everything about credit cards was money of account.  I didn't know the merchant's got money of exchange.\n\nI know both money of account and money of exchange are debt.\n\nI knew money of exchange can get you money of account, but I didn't know money of account can't get you money of exchange.\nSo that one has my brain going trying to figure out why that is.\n\nMy brain is fried... Sitting here thinking isn't bringing up anything different.  I'm missing something and it's right in front of me, but I don't see it.",
