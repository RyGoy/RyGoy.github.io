   "message": "Remember Pete and Anibal; If they don't know any better, their intent is not hostile. This is the hardest and most annoying part. There is no INTENT. They cannot be blamed.\n\nThose that are lying about me, DO know better. Redirect your annoyance at poor Mr. Nicoll, to something that deserves the contempt you feel, because THEY are why Mr. Nicoll even exists in his current mindset.\n\nThis isn't Sewer Ellie, or the Piece-of-Shit Christians. Don't harm the victims, no matter how right you are to feel contempt. They don't know any better, and it's probably cruel for them to know anything else, but I don't really care. I DO know something else, and I have lived my live there. It's dying and needs fresh minds to bring it back to life.\n\nI'm going to show you how to bring the whole corrupt mess down, and then I will show you how to build what you are looking for. Didn't you know? I have THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING. :D\n\nTrue Story! :D\n\nAnyway, TL;DR: Ignorance is not hostility. TRY not to beat up the ignorant. I REALLY know what you are feeling... you have all made me feel it at one time or another.",
