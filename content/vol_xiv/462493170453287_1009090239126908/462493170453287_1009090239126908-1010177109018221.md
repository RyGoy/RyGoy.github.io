The old Soviet Union used to have \"hearings\" like this, just so they could claim there was \"public consultation\".\n\nThey won't LET him ask questions, and as a \"Deputant\" he is LEGALLY (on your behalf) relegating the public to \"Active third party\" with no standing.\n\n\"Useful idiots\" remove your rights.",
