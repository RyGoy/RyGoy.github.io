   "message": "So, as I had previously anticipated, I have PROOF they local IRS is going to STEAL that LEGAL MONEY/BILLS OF EXCHANGE I sent them.\n\nI got a letter, with the photocopied signature, from an alleged employee sending a \"garnish\" notice, without having adjusted the account after receiving the bills of exchange.\n\nI said I PROMISE I will pay, no controversy, should they refuse, or if what I did was illegal, immoral or wrong, just to send those Bills stamped refused. :/  \n\nI am busy right now, but I will place the letter I got sent here later.",
