   "message": "So there's an AGENCY who DEMAND money. And the money they demand, is for buying a public debt.....now, I can't speak for you, but here in Quebec, I have all the good reasons to believe that we are being robbed through these demands.....\n\nSo I prefer not buy, but use the surety so it can discharge these debts....as soon as I will be very sure that they've stop the robbery, I will agree to buy back these debts....\n\nI have NO PROBLEMS sharing.......",
