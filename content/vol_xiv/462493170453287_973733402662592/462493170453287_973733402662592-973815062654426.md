   "message": "To my surprise, in her response the State Comptroller ACKNOWLEDGES ME as the Sole Authorized Administrator. NOTICE I DID NOT use a name for the MAN. I DID NOT \"identified\" the man with a name. I NEVER mentioned WHO was sending notice, other than the TITLE of Administrator. \n\nHere is the OFFICIAL letter with her SIGNATURE (SURETY). For the newbies, how can a State Comptroller refer to the Sole Authorized Administrator is that is some crazy made-up bullshit?\n\nNot only that, she also gave me INSTRUCTIONS on how to proceed by sending my information to the local Treasury Department. Please see for yourself.",
