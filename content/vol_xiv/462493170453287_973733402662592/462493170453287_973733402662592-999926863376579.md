   "message": "I called the Secretary of the Treasury who I sent personally the Bills of Exchange, and NOT to my surprise, his office in a rude manner expressed they have NO IDEA about any Bills of Exchange sent. They are either lost, or stolen, but I do have confirmation from the Post Master the Secretary DID receive and ACCEPTED the registered mail marked BILLS OF EXCHANGE ENCLOSED.\n\nSince I have a hand singed letter from the State Comptroller saying, and I quote:\n\n\"The Office of the Comptroller of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is the agency which audits all use of public funds and transactions of property of the Commonwealth, it's agencies and instrumentalities and it's municipalities, in order to determine whether they have been made in accordance with the law.\n\nIf you have any information regarding inappropriate use of property of public funds, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible.\"\n\nSo, since those 2 Bills of Exchange and those 2 SECURITIES (Birth Certtificates) I sent are PROPERTY of the Commonwealth, and I sent those in a TRANSACTION of PROPERTY, I sent a notice to the State Comptroller making her Office aware of this missing property. \n\nI will NOT stop. I told her, should the tender for law that money provides turns out to be FRAUD, I will inform the public of the HOSTILE INTENTIONS from the Treasury Department towards the public.\n\nYou have NO idea how mad I am. It's NOT safe to be around me right now.",
