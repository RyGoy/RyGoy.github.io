   "description": "\"The Resilience system is built to produce emergent effects from smaller parts, and mimics how nature achieves that through the use of evolutionary algorithms. The result is a fully voluntary basic income system, built on new governance mechanisms to create something that's beyond our current literal grid. The system achieves what could be described as 'decentralized taxation' through a pay-it-forward mechanism, so that each step in a consumption chain contributes the same amount, using the principles of variation, selection and heredity.\n\nThe Resilience system is not based on 'donations' or 'charity', nor is it government enforced taxation. It is something new. \"",
