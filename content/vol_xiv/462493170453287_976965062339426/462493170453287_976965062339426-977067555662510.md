   "message": "David Johnson, LIES constantly on his BIRTH CERTIFICATE page.  It's like the sole reason for its existence is to lie to people who are just waking up and distract them from reality.  \n\nOnce, when I first started in The Tender for Law, I reached out to David Johnson, who has a Massachusetts Birth Certificate, and, in fact, was born in the same county I was, to meet him...he now lives about an hour from me.  \n\nThis was after a very long discussion and him leading me to bullshit.  \n\nThe conversation stopped right there and he never responded to me again.  \n\nLets flip the coin....After 9 months in The Tender for Law, 4 or 5 of which I was silent, mostly, Scott and Tara graciously accepted Anibal and I onto their boat and spent a few hours with us answering absolutely stupid questions.  They sent us on our way when the last train was coming through (and we used that train to kill a lawyer)\n\nThis is the difference here!  Scott is honest and NEVER, not once, offered any unverifiable bullshit from the 19th century.  This is David Johnsons specialty. \n\nNeens Jean, is this one of the freedumbers that had you reading bullshit?  Is there anything you are ready to share here yet?",
