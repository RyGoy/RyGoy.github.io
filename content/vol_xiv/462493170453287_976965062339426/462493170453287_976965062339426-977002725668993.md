   "message": "I dont know how old any of you are or how you have lived, I will give you a quick bio, so you get a small ideal of why I think and say what I say..from a young age I was abused, badly, the belief then, as you say \"pray\" I prayed for god to take me or take him, I ran at age 15 because he was going to kill me or I was going to die trying to kill him. So praying at that,time saved me from death, now I believe that \"praying\" simply gave me the courage or like a pep talk to do what I had to do to survive. I am 55 now and at 52 I started researching, and I began to wake up to all the fraud, lies and deceptions around the world, it was a hard awakening.",
