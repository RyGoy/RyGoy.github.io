   "message": "You CAN. It's a waste of time.\n\nTo follow the rules NOW would mean the end of them. They simply won't. They will actually make up excuses in their head that they are doing the \"right thing\" and that you \"deserve it\".\n\nTHAT is why it's morally and ethically OK to kill government workers.\n\nIt's a story that has played out through history. Nazis did everything \"legally\" too. All of the people who did these horrible acts, did so knowing \"it's all perfectly legal\" and that \"there is a court order\", and \"I'm just doing my job\" is the excuse that will get you out of anything you know is wrong.",
