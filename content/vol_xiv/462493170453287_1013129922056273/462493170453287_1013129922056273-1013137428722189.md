   "message": "I was feeling that in 1982. My parents and Grandparents always wondered why I was always in a bitter rage. Julius Cruise is now experiencing what I was, in 1982. I remember it like it was yesterday.\n\nI was a child. I didn't know anything EXCEPT that everyone loves their lies, and EVERY adult was lying to me. All they understood is lies, and that's all they got from me.\n\nThey sold me to the fucking government and then wondered why I was always so hostile to them.\n\nGo figure!\n\n...also: While you are building, NEVER let them take you seriously.\n\nI was a smart kid. :D",
