   "message": "As you may have guessed, I REALLY RESENT it when people who take the time to learn what I have to teach, are lied to.\n\nIF YOU LIE TO ANYONE WHO LEARNS FROM ME, I WILL ALWAYS CALL YOU OUT ON IT. Steph Boucher happens to be one of those people. Larken Rose doesn't get a pass. You don't get to lie to those who learn from me. It is an insult to my work, and to their intellect, and since your collective faggotry gives \"being offended\" a special status, these days, I'd like to cash those chips in.",
