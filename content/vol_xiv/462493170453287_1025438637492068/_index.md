   "message": "thank to derek moran for telling about this group...\n\nI would like to ask what people here know about the statute of westminster, and the treaty of paris, when in the jurisdiction of the corp sole CANADA  \n\nit is my belief the statute of westminster is the trust that created CANADA as we know it today, well the start of the tyranny we see today.\n\nIMO the queen released all rights and duties to all common wealth inhabitants and also granted the land masses to the associated common wealth.\n\nthis made a monarchy jurisprudence disaster, monarchy jurisprudence does not allow anarchy (no law or judge to administer)\n\nwith the freedom granted , freedom can not be removed or given away...\n\nwith all subject no longer subject of the crowns LAWS unless under consent, this left a void in the legal system of CANADA.\n\nthis IMO is where the state of CANADA has used the law of principal and agent along with the law of nations to usurp the rights and duties of mankind within this imaginary land jurisdiction and  the corp agent.\n\nthis is what created the birth certificate, and the requirements to register the live record of birth...\n\nthis is the trustee agreement of the crown, showing the jurisdiction one came from and the declaration of freedom and natural rights under natural law....\n\nbut there is a catch, by not claiming the live record, and claiming the birth certificate is your consent to government as a trustee NOT principal,\n\nas one can see, if the above is correct, that the choice is an individual one .\n\nthen we look at the charter and other supreme court of CANADA case law, that CANADA is FREE and democratic. all case law shows a 2 tier system, and multiple jurisdictions, natural law,civil law, parliamentary law, and the addition of fundamental justice as well as the need for material fact to show the judge the proper sphere the individual must be judges under, \n\nthe we look at other SCC case law that states if an individual is not within the jurisdiction of an act, the individual does not infringe on the act, the act infringes on the individual.... \n\nI also have the SCC case law that states that the treaty of paris and its effects have not been determined by the supreme court of canada...\n\nI have a canada law research group on https://omnipotence.ca for anyone wanting a lot of case law to substantiate the basis of this theory...",
