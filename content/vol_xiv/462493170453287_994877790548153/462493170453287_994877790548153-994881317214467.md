   "message": "He's in love with clubhouse rules, and he's trying to \"know about law\", as if it matters. Now he's trying to find where the law society claims OWNERSHIP of all \"Individuals\".\n\nHis ONLY knowledge of law, comes from me. He has never had an original thought, and in 2012 I warned him that he will be the same forever. three years later that has proven to be the case.\n\nHe's become a useful idiot for the Law Society, and I refuse to answer any of his bullshit worthless, and pointless questions, and he's all butt-hurt.",
