   "message": "Just saw a comment made by Derek Moran in another group what seemed like a cheap shot towards Scott. Not familiar with any history here, if any, between Scott and Derek. I am aware Scott can defend himself, just wondering what's up with him, noticed he is on my friends list. If he is a douche let me know so I can drop him from my page.\n\nThanks.",
