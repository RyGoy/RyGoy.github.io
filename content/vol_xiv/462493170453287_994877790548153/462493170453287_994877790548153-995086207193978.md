   "message": "There is no single place where is says specifically Law Society claims ownership of INDIVIDUALS. It becomes self evident once you connect the dots. It's done via AGENCY in an insidious way using legalese. Just like with \"slavery,\" the law says it was abolished, but here in REALITY it is CODIFIED in our \"laws\" via codes, acts, and statutes with the force of \"law.\" \n\nThat is why Derek Moran it's such a danger to your mind. He BELIEVES in \"law.\"",
