   "message": "The problem with having a Derek Moran brain is that since truth is SELF EVIDENT many things are NOT written per se. But when you look at the facts, and the mechanics of how \"law' operates you can see reality.  \n\nSince Derek does not see that a magic parchment specifically says that the Law Society claims ownership of all INDIVIDUALS, he will NEVER see it. And since magic parchments say slavery was abolished, gee I guess it's true, it's been abolished!\n\nYou see the problem with this way of NON-thinking?",
