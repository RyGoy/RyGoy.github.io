   "message": "From: We get letters too sometimes...\n\nFrom Derek (who still has a hard time spelling license after all these years of studying THEIR CLUBHOUSE RULES)...\n\nIf a lawyer requires a licence to practice law...and a LICENCE is PERMISSION to PERFORM an ILLEGAL/UNLAWFUL act...then a good follow-up question to Scott in regards to your lawyer-adventure you were talking about is: What is the ILLEGAL and/or UNLAWFUL act that a lawyer is performing that requires them to have a LICENCE to do it?\n\n****\n\nand then this (not a private message)...\n\nDerek Moran If the Law Society has CLAIMED OWNERSHIP over ALL INDIVIDUALS, Harry - then, think Scott's PROPER NOTICE thread... wouldnt they have given NOTICE that:\n\n\"PUBLIC NOTICE\n\nWe here at the Law Society CLAIM OWNERSHIP over ALL INDIVIDUALS\"\n------------------\n...where did they do this, where does it say that? If its TRUE, it can be VERIFIED, and it could be verified INDEPENDENTLY.",
