   "message": "David-Paul My apologies, i was reading;) i was searching for the senate votes on c51, c-9  caught my eye. Of course, considering the amount, and to whom it's going, instantly pissed me off so i started reading. Why is she receiving funds for administration? (Ceit Butler Pete and franki have been whacking me left and right for almost a year??? i can take it.) what kind of expenses can occur that would cost such unforeseen spending? If i've understood anything so far, is that these funds are split amongst different gvmnt agencies for expenses not listed in their budgets. Maybe i haven't; no doubt someone will correct me if i am wrong. ??",
