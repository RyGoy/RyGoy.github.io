Her Majesty enacted it, right?\n\nI am very sory to have to inform you of this situation Dear Deputy Attorney General of Canada, but it�s now evident for me that Jonathan Rabchuk�s intents are HOSTILE against the public, and I demand him to be fired from public services. That document has been signed by him, he supplied the proofs for these hostile intents.\n\nIf by any chance, it is true that we, Quebecoise and Quebecois, are the Crown�s properties and/or slaves, please inform me asap, so I can inform the public.\n\nIf I don�t receive answers within ten (10) days, I will understand that effectively, we, Quebecoise and Quebecois, are the Crown�s properties and/or Slaves, and that your intents are HOSTILE against us.",
