   "message": "I'm not sure any of you really understand the offence here.  Someone you don't know, and whose company you did not solicit in any way, can now have your access blocked for 30 days because they don't like your response.  Someone with hurt feelings can take value away from other people, because he/she literally asked for abuse and then called to politically correct \"daddy\" to punish you.\n\nLet that sink in.  More and more people are being silenced by a growing minority who solicit their company, and then decide they don't like how the conversation progresses.\n\nFuck all y'all with your pandering to people's imaginary hurt feelings, social justice bullshit, political correctness, and different rules for straight white men.  There is virtually no one who has frequented any forums we moderate who has not, at one time or another, wanted the language toned down, or a kinder, gentler approach.  Free speech my ass!  I'm really getting tired of trying to make this point.\n\nYou will all eventually get what you support and deserve.",
