   "message": "Yes, I have removed Steph Boucher from this group. I have blocked him from my view.\n\nA few (2) of his faggot long time friends decided that what I do is stupid. One of them said that I should choose my battle better. Like these bullies who ONLY pick those who they are sure to win on.\n\nThe other one seems to be hurt because I write in English instead of French, he tagged me with the name \"papoute\". I hate to be tagged with names.\n\nAnd Steph decided to back his faggot friends, and it's his RIGHT to do so. But it's also my RIGHT to get rid of him from my view. I don't need him, I really don't. I have NOTHING to sell.\n\nNone of my friends will call Scott Duncan with names, because if they do, I will slap them, and they know it.\n\nI will not tolerate that bullshit anymore, My goal is to prove that we are either a SLAVE or not a slave for this public debt. I suffered a lot to achieve this goal, as well as my family. And each day I get closer to this goal.\n\nIf you're not sure about your \"close friends\" being faggots, don't tag me in your threads, I DO NOT NEED YOU.....if you decide to tag me in threads where your faggots friends will show up, make sure to pick your side. You are either with me, or against me. There can't be \"gray zone\" \n\n:P .....FUCK OFF WITH THE BULLSHIT, I wish I would have Scott's patience, but I don't... :(",
