   "message": "Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson creates profiles JUST for me. Let that sink in.\n\nI have an agenda, and some of you see the scale of it, so the time I spend here is justified, even if I'm \"crazy\".\n\nSo why is he? He's been at it for over a year, and REALLY wants to lie about me, to the point where he literally creates pretend people so he can do so.\n\nDoes this seem like a RATIONAL thing to do?\n\nWould ANY of you dedicate OVER A YEAR of this, just to lie? \n\n...and when your lies are refuted, would you just pretend that the lie never happened?\n\nSeriously, is that \"normal\", in ANY context? <---that's not a rhetorical question.",
