   "message": "BACKGROUND: A year ago my brother decided that he would sue his family for not following his wishes to sell our father's home immediately. \n\nWhat follows is a letter I drafted in response to my brother's solicitor, Ms. Deputy Justice Kathleen Howes (https://ca.linkedin.com/in/kathleen-howes-a6039661), requesting that I approve for \"form and content\" what she refers to as an \"order\". It's the mechanism for how these law society scum take an endorsement and turn it into an order that is important to pay attention to. \n\nThese lawyers even ask for your CONSENT beforehand. I'm serious. Our (former) lawyer, Mr. Howard Cohen (http://www.cohensabsay.com), claimed that he presented us with the draft as a \"courtesy\". We all know that this officer of the court extending a a courtesy to me means I'm the one getting fucked. I even told him as much :D  \n\nMr. Cohen's LIE was to imply that my consent was a formality and/or not \"necessary\". It is worth noting that the endorsement of the Justice did not magically become an \"order\" because the Trustees did not sign. :D\n\nI am posting this after Anibal Jose Baez reminded the group that an \"Order\" can be VOIDed. I will share images of the \"Endorsement\" written by Mr. Justice Barnes and the \"Draft Order\" prepared by Ms. Howes to be sure I VOID this order correctly. \n\nI may be mistaken but it seems it only becomes an \"order\" when I SIGN. It seems counter intuitive that I would be asked to CONSENT to an order. I'm being asked to CONSENT to my own rape. :/ Is this what Gail Marie missed Scott?\n\nI would never have asked \"What is the mechanism?\" had I only focussed on the data. YOU CAN'T UNLEARN what Scott teaches. \n\n18th May 2016\n\nWITHOUT PREJUDICE\n\nKathleen A. Howes\nUnifor Legal Services Plan\n23 Regan Road\nBrampton, Ontario\nL7A 1B2\n\nMs. Howes, \n\nA smart man told me that a signature represents CONSENT and UNDERSTANDING. It can�t be anything else. \n\nThe executors have expressed repeatedly that we do not consent to these proceedings and that we respond under protest, threat and duress only. Compelling us to respond under these circumstances does not change this fact.\n\nOn August 20th, 2015 Ms. Justice Meredith Donohue declared that the consent of the executors �is not required for this proceeding�. While this declaration is both offensive and unacceptable, if it is true, then it is only reasonable to conclude that since our consent is not required then our signatures are not required either. Therefore, in keeping with her declaration, the �Draft Order� that you forwarded to the executors is being respectfully returned, unsigned, with this response. \n\nShould I be mistaken, and the executors have no choice but to sign this �draft order�, then we will cooperate since it is only reasonable to conclude that we are the property of the Attorney General, these courts and/or the Law Society. All that I require is written proof of this from the Attorney General and/or a Justice and/or the Law Society and we will sign immediately. \n\nOtherwise bring guns. A thief doesn�t ask me for permission to take my property, so let�s abandon all pretenses and call it for what it is. If I am being compelled to sign, under threat of financial and/or physical harm, then bring guns and I will cooperate with your �request�, but I will not willingly provide my consent. \n\nThe executors also do not understand the endorsement written by Mr. Justice Kofi Barnes given that the January 8th, 2016 transcript that I filed reveals that his spoken words contradict his �endorsement�. Perhaps Ms. \"Deputy Justice\" Kathleen Howes should seek clarification from her colleague. \n\nOne more thing, Scott Duncan says �Hello!� \n\nSincerely,\n\nBy: David-Paul, Executor for the Estate of DAVID PAUL SIP\n       ALL RIGHTS RESERVED",
