   "message": "Tell her that you would be GRATEFUL for any refutation to ANYTHING regarding \"legal\" matters that Scott Duncan teaches here at THE TENDER FOR LAW.\n\nThank her for answering the question directly, and refraining from Ad Hominem responses, and/or vague declarations from \"authority\".\n\nAlso inform her of your intent to share and/or publish all materials from this matter, as you are currently witnessing very disturbing events in Quebec, regarding publication of materials in legal matters, and you intend to challenge that publicly...\n\n...in the interest of JUSTICE, of course! :D",
