   "message": "In the U.S., the census is taken every 10 years.  I have never filled out one of their forms in my lifetime.  (NO, I will not say how old I am....it's a woman thing so f/o.)  I've always just \"trashed\" the form and the envelope as it was never addressed to ME.  \n\nI'm not sure why folks voluntarily fill out this form....regardless of how the envelope is addressed.",
