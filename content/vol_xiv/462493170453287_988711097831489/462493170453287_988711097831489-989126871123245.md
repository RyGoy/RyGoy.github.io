   "message": "And so what if i have that on my timeline.. im not here to talk about chemtrails or antivax and i didnt think this page was about that. But somehow it keeps get brought up.. is that what this page is about???? I didnt join this page to talk about that i joined this page to find out about tender for law.. is that ok.. or am i getting  persecuted for what colour my socks are.. i never came here to upset anyone or judge them. I came here with an open mind but if you dont want me here thats fine ill survive.. actually i dont think this group is for me.. your just horrible, you stalk my wall and then throw rocks at me.. maybe thats my delusion. That people are essentually good that its ok  for people to have thier own opinions without being felt uncomfortable by someone elses, just because they dont share the same reality.. Ceit Butler your a douche.. i wasnt talking to you anyway i was talking to Scott Duncan. So who asked for your5 cents.. it seems you just wanted an argument or something. Were you trying to get me to defend my opinion by stalking my wall, so i could be attacked by all sides  to prove your opinion or reality to me.. just because its the evening where you are doesnt mean it is for everyone, its 5.48 in the morning here.. everyones reality is different and just because our paths are not the same doesnt mean we arent going to the same place it just takes others a bit longer,",
