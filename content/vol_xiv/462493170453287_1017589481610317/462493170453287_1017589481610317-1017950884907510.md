   "message": "There's a dumb joke that goes like this:  A new child is born and is about to receive its name.  A young village boy asks the elder how children's names are determined.  \"Well son\" says the elder, \"When the blessed event occurs we look out the window for a sign, and what we see determines the name of the child.
