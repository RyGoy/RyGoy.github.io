   "message": "Try to imagine what it's like being ME!\n\nThe ugly reality is that my life was EASIER when it was my job to lie to people. I just didn't have anything worthwhile, and people who lie for a living forfeit any claim to the company of worthwhile people.\n\nI've been telling the truth so long, I forgot how to lie. :/ I can talk to people, right up to the point where I must lie.\n\nI haven't had a conversation outside of AQUILAE (and here) that lasted more than 2 minutes.  I just walk away. How do I respond? I can't exactly tell them they they think wrong, value the wrong things, and are programmed to lie! They get upset. I tried.  :D",
