   "message": "Adam Cormier, you are too emotionally erratic and/or crippled to do anything useful. I mean that seriously.\n\nYou lack the focus necessary. Anger consumes you, and you don't know who/what to be angry at.\n\nYou think wrong and value the wrong things, and your anger will only serve those you fight. It's how you are programmed.\n\nI'm one of the \"bad guys\" that was kicked out of the \"club\". I know what I'm talking about here.\n\n#ScottIsAlwaysRight is not a joke. It's true. It took nearly 20 years to master the skills necessary to do that, and as a result, change EVERYTHING. Make no mistake, I am far angrier than you will ever be, for far greater reasons.\n\nHeed this warning: You are running a program.  What you feel is deliberately unfocused, and focused on the wrong things, when you try to do something about it. When you act on it, you serve strangers who don't give a shit, or even know who you are. You are programmed cattle.\n\nNobody cares about angry cows.\n\nStop and focus.",
