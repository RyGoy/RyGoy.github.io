No problem, I need \"security for cost\" for that.\n\nThere's Trust's Interests\" in this.\n\n9175-2790 Quebec Inc act as TRUSTEE in this, the only reason WHY they are even in this, is because I \"systematically\" give EVERYTHING to FTP TRUST. And these liens has been given to FTP TRUST, so it was only logical that 9175-2790 QUebec Inc registered these liens, as trustess of FTP trust, right? :)",
