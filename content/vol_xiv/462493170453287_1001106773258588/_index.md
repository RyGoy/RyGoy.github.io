   "message": "I told the lawyer, in writing, to STOP sending bailiffs to my door. Reason is, since the bailiff MARTIN MERCIER entered my home without my express or tacit consent, my kids are terrified by baillifs.\n\nHe answered via fax, changing all the words I used again. It seems that they don't like the words I use, anyhow, this fax talks about some \"PROTOCOL\" in regards with the case they created.\n\nNO WHERE, since the beginning of this affair, neither of them mentions the Charter of Rights and Freedom, no where....\n\nBut they keep bombarding me with this \"Code of Civil Procedures\", they rely EVERYTHING on this code.\n\nThey want me to fill and SIGN this protocol thing.\n\nHere's what will be my answer to this....\n\nI will COOPERATE and fill and sign this thing, but I need you FIRST to respect, admit and recognize the Quebec Charter as the fundamental LAW that has precedence on all other LAWS in Quebec. As soon as you SIGN this, I will SIGN your stuff.\n\nOf course, it will be written in French, and will be beautifully written :P\n\nAnd it will be filed into the case at the court house....\n\nThey just don't want to even say outloud \"QUEBEC CHARTER\", it's like they are allergic to it.... :/\n\nWeird.... :/\n\nHow will I have my fundamental rights recognized if they don't recognize the Charter ? :/\n\nThanks\nWith Love\nPeace",
