   "message": "Sewer Ellie ( Mick Parker ) will NOT like this. He gets all butt-hurt when the things I decree come to fruition. \n\nHe hates that this group exists proving everything I say. :D\n\nWell he's not as dumb as Menard of Clifford. I'll bet they BOTH wish they had 500 BTC right now! :D\n\nWhen i taught people to make a wallet, I would send 500 BTC to them to show them their first transfer. That was in 2010-11. I don't do that anymore. Adoption is NOT an issue like it was back then.\n\nCan you imagine how STUPID they must feel?\n\nSewer Ellie has that. He hates this group because it makes him look STUPID. Truth be told, he doesn't really need this group to make him look stupid. :D",
