   "message": "This man is the MINORITY. Remember the SCOTTISM \"The MAJORITY is ALWAYS wrong\"? Well that. The remaining UNaccountable parasitical looters surrounding him are unconcerned with maintaining any semblance of \"Justice\". \n\nThey will talk about being \"fair\" and yet MR Scott Price, the new council retained by the trustess for my Dad's Estate, states that \"this has nothing to do with fairness\" :/ \n\nSo is Ms Justice Meredith Donohue WRONG then? She asked \"How is that fair?\" after I served documents (including a NOTICE OF MISTAKE) upon the applicant and/or his council. She stated that the applicant must be allowed time to respond. Funny that. I don't recall consenting to be there. Oh I nearly forgot (actually i didn't). Our consent does not matter accoring do Ms Donohue.",
