   "message": "This is Ian Nordheimer. This is one of the few \"respectable\" Justices. He's stuck there. He knows everything you do, and he tries to \"change it from the inside\". It's futile. and misguided, but this man is who you'd want to appear in front of, if forced.\n\nScott Duncan has tried Pro Se cases in front of him before. Scott Duncan has said often that he would model his work after Nordheimer if he was compelled to be a \"justice\".\n\nThis is a guy who knows he is in \"Hotel California\", and unlike most who are there by choice and deserve to have their eyes and thumbs removed, Mr Nordheimer is making the system pay for his lot in life.\n\nThis is the only \"activist justice\" you will find.\n\nScott Duncan gave us all a long lecture about him. You'd probably get one now, if he could.",
