Ive been hinting at something in here for months, so now I will go into detail using a totally metaphorical and totally not real example. üòÅ
Let's say that you are 18 and you are smarter than the rest of your high school buddies, so you opt to go to trade school rather than college. This is a GOOD DECISION! You figure that you can work as an apprentice during the day to collect your hours and go to school at night to satisfy the classroom requirements for the license that you hope to earn (yes, this is hilarious). Does everyone know how this very simple mechanism works? ....good.

I'm not sure what the schooling costs, but I'll assume for the example that it costs $50,000. This should be an expense by a corporation that will be realized against future gains! Sadly, NO ONE seems to be taking advantage of this, up to, and including the members in here. üòÅ I am giving you my time freely and you are presumably spending yours in here with the intent of MAKING MORE MONEY. Wait, what? MAKING MONEY? Is that similar to making cookies, or making dinner? Yup, it's the same thing. When you use your skill, whatever they may be, you are creating something that didn't exist prior. By accepting fiat, you are accepting the creation of debt for the creation that you made. It doesn't take an advanced degree in mathematics to see this scam.

Let's jump back to my example. At 18, this guy decides to take on $50,000 in schooling and 5 years of apprenticeship in order to receive a journeymans license. When he receives this license, his pay will go up fairly dramatically. He would not have been able to MAKE this extra money without spending time and money, so this time and money should be a PRETAX cost of MAKING THE MONEY, or more commonly called, a cost of doing business, or expense. This will set off the young journeymans' first $50,000 (minimum) in INCOME (or side jobs) against the previous loss on the books. This very smart young man will be starting off ahead of everyone else by having a corporation suck up the loss until it could be realized later.

EVERYONE SHOULD BE DOING THIS!!! If you spend time and/or money with the intent (note: it doesn't matter if you actually succeed) of MAKING MONEY (creating debt), you should be documenting your expenses.

This is as dumbed down as I can make this. If you learn ANYTHING in here and there is a cost associated with it, it can be an expense on your books! Have you bought a computer with the intent of using it to learn how to MAKE MONEY? Do you have any programs on that machine that can be used to MAKE MONEY?

Ok....that's that. Now, let's discuss the program that you run that doesn't allow you to see this. First, some big scary ARTIFICIAL PERSON called the IRS takes money from you up front because you agreed to this. You MADE MONEY using an account that isn't yours, and there's a fee for this! So, they take it up front, then let you figure out how to get some of it back. They'll even threaten you and use scare tactics to make sure you remain docile giver. They've also inserted arbitrary parameters of time around the creation of money. If you created debt between Jan 1-Dec 31, there's a fee, but if you lost everything the following Jan 1, too bad, you lose! This is clearly arbitrary and a scam. MAKING MONEY using the account that you know as LEGAL NAME, does not allow you to carry losses forward, the rules around corporations do. No one knows this! Why? Because you are indoctrinated from a young age to give your shit away. It's built this way. You have the creation of debt in place of money, artificial parameters, big scary artificial person, and rules. This is a very simple and often duplicated method of controlling you, in this case robbing you.

Ok? Are we all on the same page? Great. In our example, our little journeyman has started off in his trade $50,000 in the hole, which we've shown to be beneficial! And legal! Now, our little journeyman is MAKING MONEY. He is making so much money that there appears to be a tax liability coming up because the corporation that he gives his time to has used up its prior losses. (This is called RETAINED EARNINGS, btw) Well, he could use the corporation to hold shares in other corporations. This would be done by exchanging EARNINGS (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Ammortization....banks look at this, called EBITA to determine how much credit you can create before you are robbed) for SHARES in other corporations. Our journeyman could use the credit that he's created to invest in real estate or the stock market or cryptocurrency infrastructure. üòÅ Get it?

We all should be this apprentice! If we are deemed in commerce 24/7, then we should be able to account for our time in the creation of debt. I'll use me as an example....again. I watch a SHITLOAD of YouTube videos. I learned a lot there. I learned how to do metal work, home repairs, truck repairs, etc. is this TIME that I spend which results in the creation of debt supposed to be free? Of course not! I'm not a fucking slave! If I spend time that COULD result in the creation of money, I bill for it. Simple!

Our little journeyman should be a millionaire by the time he's 30...
