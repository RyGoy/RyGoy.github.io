This isn't easy to write because you are all begging me to come down to your level. Well, I am not at your level. I have never been an "employee", well, as an adult, and I've never not had tens of thousands in Accounts Receivable in case I got into a jam. I am trying really hard to dumb it down and it's proving to be not an easy task. You are going to have to meet me halfway. ....I digress

You start a trust holding corporation. In the Articles of Incorporation, or by-laws, you allow for the corporation to pay the basic living expenses for the President. This covers all of your expenses, you are now free and YOUR accounting is done by this corporation. You then close all the accounts of the person OR the corporation can assume the accounts. Quite frankly, I wouldn't do it the second way, but it's possible. It depends on your goals.

If you had a bank account for your person, you close it and deposit the money into a bank account that you create for the corporation.
At this point, either you know how to do accounting for a corporation, or you don't. If you do, you can do it yourself. If you don't, hire an accountant. (This will be a challenge)
The corporation now has certain undertakings. One of which is to provide for the President while another is to do the accounting for the usage of the money. Both are quite easy.

All money that you get for <whatever it is that you do> gets deposited into the corporation's bank account. FOR DEPOSIT ONLY (is there anyone who doesn't get this at this point?). The corporation can hold this money until it needs to be spent because you only need money when you are spending it. While it's holding this money, it could easily convert it to Bitcoin. It could even use a service like Coinbase that allows for this exchange very easily. (I know this because i do this.) IF the Bitcoin has gains, taxes will need to be paid WHEN THE GAIN IS REALIZED. IF the Bitcoin has losses, the amount can be taken as a loss against future earnings of the corporation. You cannot lose!
You should also lien your name and resign from government service because if you do this and you haven't secured your value, then parasites will be right there to steal it from you.

Scott Duncan, I don't have a fucking clue how you do it. This is painful.
This is as dumbed down as I can make it. I will answer all your questions as they are presented in the comments section.
