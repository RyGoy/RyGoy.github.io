Ok, since there are no questions on the board, I guess everyone is on the same page here.

Lets discuss robbing a bank. ðŸ˜€

This post is appointed by Neens Jean. She thinks wrong and values the wrong things, but she really means to appoint this article.
You found some stranger on the internet who calls you a worthless sack of shit, but you read and what he says makes sense. How can the two points be right? Is he wrong? Well, lets find out. You are all "employees" who earn a living using this legal status. This means that you are using a security in receivership to, presumably, earn income. This is a worthless legal status because you will never gain. The administrators of the receivership will surely limit how well you do and make sure they do much better off of the deal of you working. So you are worthless. How do we steal back?

I'm glad you asked....you learn about accounting. First you need value. This means that you aren't a stupid consumer and you have actually amassed assets valued at more than zero week to week. Maybe you own a car, a truck, a house, or, what you would consider, equity therein. You legally change the owner of the assets to a corporation that you are the sole shareholder of. There is more than one way to do this....

Way 1. You sell the asset(s)to the corporation. The corporation incurs a liability and has an asset. The net transaction is zero. This gets you money of exchange in the future (I'd presume you'd set up a payment plan if you trust this entity). This money of exchange is non taxable presuming that you have paid taxes on the money used to purchase the assets originally. This is a stupid way to do it, but legal.

Way 2. You EXCHANGE the assets for 1 share of the corporation. This gets the assets deposited onto the balance sheet with an Equity to Assets entry. This creates book value of the corporation from nothing. (see: creating money out of thin air...or whatever the majority thinks the Federal Reserve does)

Way 3. You lien the legal name and seize all the shit on board. This is all free stuff. [note: not free in the "no accounting" sense, free in the "corporation assuming liability" sense]
That's accouting in a nutshell. This is really easy stuff. There is nothing to be scared of, this is all a perfectly legal mechanism. Every foundation or company with "Capital" in its name is doing this. This isn't driving without a license, or not paying a mortgage, or whatever else every idiot has done. This is a legal mechanism to put more money on your Balance Sheet up front while changing NOTHING in reality. In reality, you still get to live in the house or drive the car. In reality, you still have to pay whatever you promised. But in a nutshell, corporations have more beneficial accounting that your stupid securities in receivership. yes, that is a technical term.

I hope this is clear. Legal = ACCOUNTING and Surety after all, right?
