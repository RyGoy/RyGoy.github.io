How to be a plumber, appointed by Ricky South

Step one is to actually know what the fuck you are doing. There is schooling involved, trade hours, etc. [someone remind me to get back to the schooling part later please]

Step 2-4: boring plumber shit.

Step 5: what to do with the ACCOUNTING!

If you work 5 days a week at $90 an hour, this should bring you in about $150k per year in labor, then maybe a little more if you mark up parts. There are expenses tied to this REVENUE that can be legally accounted against this to determine INCOME. But there's a tax on this shit, so legally, you would want INCOME to be the lowest it could be while having enough to cover personal expenses, etc. so what options do you have?

Well, first, this accounting should be done through a corporation. I use 4, plus I advise on 2 others. I use 4 for a reason, it's the minimum I need to account for MY TIME. I control a landscaping corporation, a holding company, a corporation that administrates MY TIME, and a music company.

If you structure this properly, you can move the accounting around through your entities thus keeping INCOME low and [holdings or investments, etc] higher. In the legal matrix, YOU control the accounting under very GENERALLY ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES.
If you are also a "HOMEOWNER", you could put this in trust and operate that like a business too, just follow the same set up as you would for a plumbing business.

If I was going to start from scratch today, I'd create a property management company, a company organized to provide basic needs for a family, whatever commercial companies I need, and a holding corporation. The holding corporation would simply act as shareholder of the others.

If you do this right, and understand the basics of corporations, trusts, agency, and accounting, then you can have a very nice life. If you can add in how to use cryptos as a reserve currency at minimum, you'd really be helping collapse a banking system.

This is it in a nutshell. Your programming makes it confusing, but it's really not. It's very simple. No one is coming to help you and the government is a fraud. You are on your own, but it's really fucking easy!
In the comments, I'd be happy to directly answer obvious legal questions that deal with ACCOUNTING, SPECIFICALLY. These will be answered under the Fair Use guidelines and shouldn't be considered legal advice.

Ok. Reviewing. All the answers? Check! Future undertaking? Check. Disclaimer? Check.

Ahhh yes. If you are an employee that does not wish to change that, DO NOT FILL THIS THREAD UP WITH YOUR "How can I do this?" You can only do parts of it. Employment is literally pre-consenting to be gang robbed by strangers, legally.
