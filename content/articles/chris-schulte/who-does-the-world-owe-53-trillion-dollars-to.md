A friend asked me to write something about this, so I figured what better place to write about taxation than in this group.
What is taxation? If you use the property, isn't it fair to pay for the usage? How can this be theft? I hope to answer these questions in the body here and in the comments if necessary.

First, you have to understand that when your parents filled out an application for a Birth Certificate, the government has to reorganize itself to account for a new organization on its books. The government has both a liability to the organization and the organization has duties owed to the government. The government borrows against the future duties in order to fulfill its obligations. Wait, what did I just say? It borrows against the future of an organization to fulfill its' duties to the organization. Yes, it saddles the organization with debt to fulfill its debt. Currently, the National Debt of the United States is almost $20 trillion. (Which shouldn't be a thing here in reality, but it is) The government is borrowing using private banks as brokers against this organizations' future which represents you. It shouldn't take a mathematician to see the fraudulent nature of this. Of course if there was disclosure, there would be no fraud, but did any of you ever get disclosure on this? I didn't think so.....anyway..... Because there is debt in transit, which is money, a security must be issued. This security is a Bill of Lading. While the cargo is in your possession, you are liable for it. The cargo is debt. (Unfortunately, I can't think of a simpler way to communicate this)

We have the PRINCIPAL out of the way. The last paragraph covered, in full, the principal of debt. Well, now we need to cover the interest in order to see where the tax dollars go. Interest? Why can't we borrow from ourselves at zero percent interest? We are trading in worthless fiat anyway? Why is interest actually a thing? .....unfortunately, these questions will be answered in lots of blood when everyone figures it out.

Corporate Income Tax pays 100% (or is supposed to) for Military spending. Gas Tas pay 100% (or is supposed to) for usage of the roads. I think its 39.6 cents per gallon currently in Massachusetts, but I didn't check recently. This means that a truck pays about 4 cents per mile to use the roads. I am no mathematician and I didn't do the math, but this sounds reasonable for usage. Cigarette and Alcohol Tax pays for infrastructure. Local Sales Tax pays interest on borrowed municipal money that was used for local projects. Property Taxes pays for local services (trash pickup, school, whatever else they decide you shouldn't have a freemarket alternative for...) Point here is that taxes are earmarked for usage. You are supposed to get what you are paying for. I very highly doubt anyone is here because they've gotten what they paid for from the government.

But what about that principal? Where is the earmark to pay that off? Paying it off would render the trustee, government, out of business. It's not ever scheduled to be paid off for very obvious reasons. It's perpetual on purpose.

This group is called Legal = Accounting and Surety. The accounting is how you follow the money. In the banking part of the legal matrix, money flows through debits and credits. When the government needs more money, they insert a new stopping point to hold credits. The debits are stolen from you. Remember, these people ALREADY have a principal that they administrate. Lets examine one of these stopping points at random. IRS Witholding. ðŸ˜ƒ This is something that didn't exist before the 50s. All of a sudden, every American needs to deposit a certain portion of their earnings up front onto a strangers Balance Sheet. The stranger registers the Money of Exchange as Money of Account and a credit on the books. This credit can buy more credit. That is what Money of Account is. Money of Account is 95% of the money in circulation. This competes directly with the value of the money in your pocket, Money of Exchange. This fractal is theft, by its very nature. If you want to see a theft that is 40x worse than this, look at Social Security using the same formula and multiply it by 40 (which is how long it will take you to get any of that money back). Then, when you look at this and multiply one side by 40, the other side needs to be divided by 40 and you will see that they are robbing you to a degree that should enrage you.

We have covered the principal to this point. We have gone over a basic fractal in the legal matrix to show how money of account directly competes with the money in your pocket. So how is taxation theft? Taxation is theft, very simply, because your value is given away up front and you are not getting what you paid for. Not only that, but you do not have any choice in the matter. Anyone with a second grade education in math can follow it. It's very easy to see. Inflation (which happens before income taxation) is also theft.

A stranger (government) drew a charge (cargo) and put it on a vessel (Legal Name) that you are the captain of (Sole Authorized Administrator). The cargo is yours, the debt in transit stops when the cargo reaches its destination, a wharf. From that wharf, you should commission a new vessel to use in commerce only going back to the wharf when you need money.

This is as succinct as I can write this. Like Suzanne had pointed out in "the post that was deleted", Who does the world owe $53 trillion (yes, thats the actual number) to?
