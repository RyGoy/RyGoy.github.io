Scott always said to us: "I don't know what you don't know". I now see how true this is. He always said too: "I can't dumb it down any further, you have to meet me in the middle." The 2 things are true. The reason it can't be dumbed down any further is because of the language. The language of the Angols (English) was stolen from you and forked to legalese. It's a bastardized form of English that doesn't use synonyms or homonyms. Each term has 1 meaning. Anthony Massoli has posted from his notes, the most obvious of these. The one I've found that is most different is transportation. Alan Day is a direct descendant of the people affected by this.

I am one of the dumb ones. Everyone that was in THE TENDER FOR LAW will verify this. But, I learned how to speak and read in English. None of you can. The comma, including usage thereof, is hugely important. Same with the usage of is/be. These are basic rules of grammar that no one knows and it's a shame.

It was brought to my attention by a friend that you folks couldn't understand me because of the language. This is not my fault and I can't change that. Another member here said to me yesterday, and this is the cause of this post:

"I have a great deal to learn. I desire self ownership and legally defensible sovereignty. I read all that you post but most of the concepts are still somewhat foreign to me. Where's the starting point, and what can i do to acheive separation from whoever currently owns me?"

This is good feedback and asking the right questions. This is a guy who I have a chance at helping. Some friend IRL that I add here has no chance. **You have to want to not be a useless sack of shit anymore before you can not be a useless sack of shit.**

I guess you can say, this post is appointed by Tim Kinbearing. ðŸ˜ƒ

So Tim, we are strangers on the Internet that crossed paths. I promised to show anyone who asks what the truth is and you asked. First step is read all Scotts articles (it's in the group description) and look up all the CAPS terms in a legal dictionary. This group is here to show you where to verify in Merika. You can very easily go to your State statutes and verify "person". This is the easiest to confirm. After a short time parsing the legal matrix you will plainly see that you have a person, you are not a person. There are literally hundreds of other fractals just like this that you can see and learn if you look. All I can do is point you in that direction. You have to look.

There is no "self ownership" as long as debt in transit exists. This is, of course, money. The best you can do is have a corporation lien your name. This goes hand in hand with legally defensible sovereignty. Here's the thing. Sovereigns legally take ORDERS. Order is one of those terms you should look up. ðŸ˜‰ Since your former sovereignty is being held in receivership, as is Lizzys, I'd suggest sending the orders there. There was an axiom we found and it goes like this: "I am a man, I have a person". This is straight from the UN Declaration of Human Rights. This is how it works.

I think I've covered everything in detail and hope to be able to show you where to find the answers. Your goals are lofty, but attainable. You have a mountain to climb, but that's how it works.

Step 1: learn to read and write in English.
Step 2: Learn legalese.
Step 3: verify

I can't emphasize how important step 3 is.
