#### "Every one lives out a myth, and you should know what your myth is because maybe it's a tragedy"
---

Jews stole your birthright, now there’s only ritual without reflection.

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey)

The point of the Hero’s Story is to discover who One could become. One goes in[put] and comes out[put] transformed.

##### "You don't know who you are"
-Scott Duncan

Most of us don't even start the journey, or use a [journal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/journal.asp), because belief acts as a barrier that "protects" us from the unknown. Through belief we've damaged the mechanism that was supposed to guide us in developing our story of turning the unknown into the known; repeatedly. The mechanism is something like: “the courageous commitment to go out [look], find what's true, and to speak it to others so they might also choose to find it".

##### "You can't tell the difference between what's right and what feels good"
-Scott Duncan

I was a fundamentalist Catholic for more than 20 years, I found out twice in the last 6 years that I was still a Woofucker. Rather than ignoring my mistake, I looked at it deeply. The Bible is a stupid evil book, but a good metaphor can change how One sees and interacts with the world [see Jordan Peterson's work for details].

##### "Leverage the negative"
-Scott Duncan

So we're in the last ~90 days of what's left of civilization, most people are probably not prepared with more than a weeks worth of supplies by my estimate. Scott wonders why he doesn't have 1000's of Chris Schultes... This question matters because I saw everything that happened after THE TENDER FOR LAW, look at Pete's story and all the resources that were scattered or lost. Go back to Dean Clifford's broken promises and the magnitude of what was refused. Where might we be had the call to adventure been taken seriously? There is no one coming to save you.

##### "You think wrong and value the wrong things"
-Scott Duncan

I only speak this way because it's the most general way I know to produce an output (that if reasonably computed) has any hope of expressing, in my own words, how I'm "beating the program". Why is it that all Scott demands is ONLY that you discover **TRUTH** as the condition for interaction with him? Everyone else sells you lies.

##### "Computer science is the answer to everything"
-Scott Duncan

I've seen a lot of claims that go like: "That's not what Scott said", to which I've always asked, "yeah, but if it's not changing what Scott said, then does it contradict what he said?"

Yes or no?

If "no" then find out why! My goal is to find out who I am [or could be]… I’m still working on it.

In my efforts to take control of my story (Accounting Narrtive) I found the following key value pairs while writing my Personal Myth.

**The Call to Adventure** = 
"Legal is just the LAW of SURETY and ACCOUNTING" -Scott Duncan

**Supernatural Aid** = 
"ACCOUNTING is the MECHANISM by which the story of the transferance of SURETY, is told." -Chris Schulte

**Abyss Death & Rebirth** = 
"God is the ONE who does the ACCOUNTING" -Ryan Wallace
