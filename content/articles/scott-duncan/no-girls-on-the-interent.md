THERE ARE NO GIRLS ON THE INTERNET

Before we get to the post, a little history; Half of this will sound familiar because it's an Internet meme! You can look it up!

@TaraDuncan knows herself, with absolute certainty, that the history on the public record is made-up bullshit, because She took dictation when the first half was done. That's right, it was stripped of its point/counterpoint context, and only my half was posted...years after this.

In our intentional obscurity, we present for you, the lucky reader, THE ORIGINAL

This is just a story, to you. Only Tara KNOWS FOR SURE. I do this with everyone close to me. They all have an "only they know for sure", that I gave them. A kind and subtle reminder that what they see isn't real, and those of us who control the computers, control the narrative in the end. Others have been waiting for me to post this; It's a signal, but that has nothing to do with you.

Here is THE ORIGINAL...
 

Girls on the Internet
Point/Counterpoint
There are no girls on the Internet:

If I can pontificate a bit for your edification, one of the first rules of the internet is, "There are no girls on the Internet."  And this rule does not mean what you think it means.  

Allow me to explain.  Here in real life I like you for being a girl.  I want to fuck you so I pay attention to you and I pretend that what you have to say is interesting, or that you are smart or clever.  On the internet I don't have the chance to fuck you.  This means you lose the advantage of being a "girl".  You don't get a bonus conversation just because I'd like to put my dick in you.

When I see posts that end with, "I'm a girl", you are simply begging for attention.  The only reason you would mention your gender is because you wish your "girl advantage" back, usually because you are too vapid and too stupid to do or say anything without it.  You are simply forgetting the rules.  There are no girls on the internet.  

There is one exception to this rule.  The one way you can get your "girlness" back on the internet -- and that is of course to post your tits.  This is, and should be, degrading for you as it is clearly an admission that the only thing interesting about you is your naked body.  

To summarize...tits or get the fuck out.

COUNTERPOINT

I am a girl on the Internet:

Who says, "There are no girls on the Internet"?  I beg to differ.  I am a girl, and I am on the Internet, duhhh!  

But I'm here to tell you, being a girl on the Internet isn't easy.  I like playing Youtube videos, chatting, and participating in important conversations, not just about fashion and world peace.  

Whenever I'm on a science site or in a chat with a bunch of anonymous male boors jacked up with their testosterone-fuelled bravado, I plow into the discussion using brains and raw logic.  I take them on mano-a-mano without exhibiting an ounce of girlness.  It's tough, what with their black/white backward way of thinking, as though the world can be reduced to a dull on/off logic.  This is just narrow-minded as the universe is filled with stars and some things really need to be expressed in shades of grey.  Sometimes these mean men hurt my feelings, but I've learned through experience that I shouldn't reveal my sex what with the, "I'd totally do her", and "Show us your tits, honey" comments.

I don't think there's anything to be gained by showing my naked body on the Internet, unless I'm looking for self-actualization or a new boyfriend.  I might consider it if I knew an Internet guy was really cute and had an annual income of over $200,000.  I'm not actually sure how to upload a picture anyway without the help of my current boyfriend who spends a ridiculous amount of time researching this crap...so there might be an interpersonal challenge there.

And speaking of my current boyfriend, I started playing computer games a few years ago.  I needed a bit of help setting up my account -- because this stuff is really hard and I don't have the time to devote to learning everything, not just because I'm a girl.  And he's so cruel to me, he made my first account on one of those flying games, "Target Drone".  Man, it was a tough few days before I gave the stupid thing up for a war game.  I was still a little shaky on the setup, what with the complexity of configuring all the pointless hardware and game settings.  I really don't know why they can't just make a game that works out of the box.  Anyway, this time he included my real girl name, and boy was that annoying!  I'm really good at these games now.  But in the beginning, playing with an account that clearly showed I was a girl, I was not invited to a team, thrown off a team, locked out of teams, shot in the head repeatedly, and repeatedly subjected to something else which I had to iconify, research and finally identified as "teabagging".  

Sometimes guys are so mean to me, not answering my questions and being blunt and sexist, that I get really depressed.  Somehow, probably because I don't make any crude or inappropriate comments, they seem to just know I'm not one of them.  I think the Internet would be so much nicer if guys had their own little areas to talk about their pointless guy things.  But we're all equal and I guess they have as much right to be here as I do.  It's your loss, men.  If you try to victimize me just because you guess I'm a girl, know this.  I'm here to stay.  You won't see me or my body parts and you certainly won't see me cry.
