You will need this soon, and it may save your life, so PAY ATTENTION.

IF YOU ARE ARRESTED: You DO NOT TALK TO POLICE, and NEVER ANSWER QUESTIONS. If they say "you're under arrest", you don't answer ANY question. Even if it sounds "innocent".

Police give NOTICE: In United States they say "You are under arrest for *Insert made-up bullshit here*. You have the right to remain silent, and ANYTHING you say may (That means "will") be used AGAINST YOU (Notice not HELP you) in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney..." followed by bullshit you should ignore. DO NOT let ANYONE act on your behalf.

In Canada you are told that you are under arrest and have the right to refuse to answer questions, and that you have the right to obtain/instruct counsel without delay.

What I am about to tell you is true in both jurisdictions.

ABOVE ALL: NEVER EVER TALK TO POLICE. EVER! I say this with the utmost emphasis because TALKING TO POLICE CANNOT HELP YOU! EVER! It is NOT POSSIBLE for police to help you. They are also legally entitled to LIE TO YOU.

"Remaining Silent" is not natural, and people usually cannot do it. Police use that against you.

Remember the following phrase, and UNDERSTAND it. Respond with the following: "I AM NOT AUTHORIZED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS".

Say it repeatedly, and memorize it.

"I AM NOT AUTHORIZED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS".

This is indicating that you already have PRIOR JOINDER with a third party. As long as you do not answer a question, they will ONLY have whatever "evidence" they already have, which in most cases is nothing substantial.

It's not like TV where they have standards. Here in reality these are just dumb government thugs. Notice how police on TV don't have beards or faggot tattoos? They do in reality! These are just dumb parasite thugs who aren't useful/wanted in the real world. It's why they resort to living off money taken by force from others, and living a life where nobody interacts with them by choice/voluntarily. Ignore what you saw on "Law & Order". It's just not true.

One of the "right to lie" tricks the police use is your DATE OF BIRTH. You are LEGALLY OBLIGATED to give your name and address. Not your DATE OF BIRTH. If they have all three of these, JOINDER is PRESUMED, legally. When they ask your date of birth, answer "none of your business". If they say they are going to arrest you, tell them that they just rang a bell that can't be un-ring, and that you are NOT AUTHORIZED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.

IF you get "Charged", you only have ONE QUESTION for the court: "WHAT EVIDENCE DOES THIS COURT HAVE, THAT I HAVE ANY SURETY IN THIS MATTER"?

Do not let them proceed without answering. They will try to trick you by feigning ignorance and asking questions like "Is your name Scott Duncan"?

(I always respond "Fuck off with your questions and answer mine! WHAT EVIDENCE DOES THIS COURT HAVE, THAT I HAVE ANY SURETY IN THIS MATTER"?)

If they rely on government ID, THAT'S NOT YOURS! Do not let them trick you into believing it is.

The CROWN/STATE is SURETY for ALL legal matters. Do not let them attach any SURETY to you. Remember:

LEGAL (Acts/Codes/Statutes with the "force of law") is the "Law" of SURETY and ACCOUNTING. Everything LEGAL has a monetary value attached. Even "crime". They do not want you to look at the ACCOUNTING part of LEGAL.

I encourage you to ask a lawyer about this. Watch as they lie about SURETY and its LEGAL meaning. They will attach it to an irrelevancy ("Isn't that something to do with bail"?) or read a dictionary definition to distract you, or sometimes they just get mad and dismiss you in feigned outrage. They do this because it is ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO TELL YOU. In fact, I'm the ONLY MAN IN CANADA that can LEGALLY tell you these things.

Every LAWYER knows this, and every ACCOUNTANT knows this. If they tell you otherwise, THEY ARE LYING, and you can tell them I said so.

In fact you can drag them to my office live! https://chat.cdd.com/RogueSupport

I can show you that they are lying step-by-step. Hopefully you will take the time to study Law and Accounting and you can learn firsthand what loathsome people Lawyers/Attorneys are. Accountants aren't much better (They lie through ommission) but at least they do something useful/practical.

Now something you NEVER see written. There is always a disclaimer, but NOT HERE.

EVERYTHING I JUST WROTE IS LEGAL ADVICE! <---you read that right.

I have the distinction of being the ONLY Jurist to respond to a Call to the Bar with "Why"? They never got back to me, and now to be called to the Bar, you have to pay a "CALLING FEE"! That's right! I'm why the call to the Bar is LITERALLY A COLLECT CALL!

I'm a polymath. A lot of things interest me, and I've done a lot with my life. Lawyer is just one of the many things I mastered. Lawyers learn from the past. They JUST do Law. If they pick a fight with me, they lose the ability to make a living as a lawyer. Just ask those at the law firm of Marin Evans! Oh... right. You can't ask them because I WIPED THEM OFF THE FUCKING MAP!

Anyway...there's thousands of dollars worth of free legal advice. Study SURETY, ACCOUNTING, and THE LAW OF AGENCY. Learn for yourself why charging ANYONE money for "LEGAL" knowledge is fraud. EVERY TIME. (I'm looking at YOU, Dean Clifford and Robert Menard, and all the "sovereign citizens" who lie through ommission so they can clean out your wallet!)

Also: ANYONE who contradicts what I have written here, is LYING WITH INTENT, and MEANS YOU HARM. There are no exceptions to this rule.
