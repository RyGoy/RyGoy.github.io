   "message": "This video is a classic. It's what is not being said, that speaks volumes to me. This man does one of the best interactions with cops I have seen on video. A wise prorogued noble told me once \"SILENCE IS GOLDEN,\" and even a \"good\" lawyer tells you \"NEVER TALK TO COPS.\" Except for the very last few minutes, AFTER the District Attorney told the cops to let this man go (for \"they\" had NOTHING), he got a bit chatty for my taste, but over all it's a great watch.\n\nThis video is yet another validation of Scott's teachings.",
