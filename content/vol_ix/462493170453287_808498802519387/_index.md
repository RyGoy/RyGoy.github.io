   "message": "To all the NON MEMBERS reading and asking to join:\n\nYou will never join this group. EVER. You are too lazy/stupid to figure out the rules. You are too lazy/stupid to join.\n\nUnless you are female and offering up your cunt, you have NOTHING of value to contribute. Period.\n\nShut up and read. Joining has NO BENEFIT and I am NOT interested in your input. YOU HAVE NO SECRETS TO TELL!\n\nIf you request to join, you will be blocked, and you won't even get to READ this group, and you already know that we are the ONLY ones who tell the truth. You already know that, or you wouldn't try to join. The only reason you'd WANT to join would be to comment.\n\n...you had 2 years to do that. The way you become a member is clearly spelled out in the ABOUT section. If you bother us with member requests, we will simply block you from the group completely. Be grateful that the group is even public.\n\nTHE TENDER FOR LAW is not a fucking \"community\" and only exists because it serves my agenda. You are not worthy of a voice here, and to give you one DIMINISHES THOSE WHO EARNED A VOICE HERE.\n\nSO....",
