   "message": "Ha ha ha! These tards love their slavery. Another example of why the majority is always wrong. Does the columnist even realize the FACT that the Elizabeth Windsor is the \"Queen of Canada\"? Does he realize the FACT that Prime Minister is NOT the head of state or even understand that when a PM asks for the Governor General's PERMISSION to prerogue parliament or call an election that this is PROOF of who the TRUE authority is?
