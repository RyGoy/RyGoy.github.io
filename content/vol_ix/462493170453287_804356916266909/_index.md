   "message": "Had a funny conversation with a banker today.  He told me that the federal government has been trying to force \"PERSONS\" to use only direct deposit.  This reminded me of how the Admiral told us a few months back about the elimination of The Bills of Exchange act.  I apologoze for any misquoted or general shit stains.  The banker also told me this is the 3rd time the feds have backed off this plan.",
