   "message": "The discussion i had this afternoon...... was about another attempt to remove Native opposition.  Most Natives on reserve do nothave bank accounts or access to the banking system except thru a proxy.  Thus many Natives who are depended on these \"cheques\" would be simply out of luck.   I also thought of Captain Pete during the cconversation.  And No the banker was not aware of anything to do with \"Security of the Person\" or anyway of discharging public debts.  But he did agree that banks are fraud and are operating in breach of trust.",
