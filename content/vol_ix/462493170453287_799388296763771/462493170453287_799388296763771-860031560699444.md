   "message": "\"How does a CORPORATION obtain a credit card to use for such purposes; when they use the PERSON's credit score/check as a decision making factor to whether they issue the card or not to the CORPORATION?\" \n\nAND\n\n\"I always wondered WHY they ask for personal information at banks to open a corporate account.\"\n\nIf you wish to establish corporate credit then DO NOT BEGIN  with commercial credit (Amex, MC, Visa). This would be a MISTAKE and is akin to running before one can even walk.:P \n\nIf folks are asked to PERSONally guarantee CORPORATE credit  it's because the corporation they control does not have an established presence or sufficient repayment history.",
