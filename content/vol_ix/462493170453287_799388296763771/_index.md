   "message": "So I arranged to meet a guy in Dublin city (bout half hour drive) to sell him a speaker. I travel to the address and pull up on a curb to check where the place is and right infront of me are 2 cops... :( \n\nThe car has one disc/tag out of date so the questioning ensued... Knowing that they'd take the car from me and arrest me somewhere in Dublin 30 miles from home I co-operated... Gave the name and address and agreed to produce a license and insurance details at my local cop station.\n\nI probably will just do that and buy their debt but my question is...\n\nIs the fact that I didn't produce any license or any Government I.D. the reason they need me to produce it at their offices? Otherwise surety is up in the air? Saying my name is Eamonn O Brien isn't enough for them to totally secure a party with surety, they need ID so as to prove a warrant of agency for the principal? (Not that they won't proceed anyway)...",
