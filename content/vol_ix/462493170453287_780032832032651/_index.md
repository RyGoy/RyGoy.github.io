   "message": "WE GET LETTERS!\n\nThe ONLY thing these idiots are good for now, is to relay messages to morons en-masse.\n\nDO NOT ASK TO JOIN! \n\nIF YOU BELONG IN THIS GROUP, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, HOW TO DO IT, AND WHY YOU ARE DOING IT!\n\nTo everyone ELSE. FUCK YOU! YOU HAD TWO YEARS! MOST OF THE REQUESTS ARE FROM PIECE-OF-SHIT CHRISTIANS TRYING TO SNEAK THEIR IMAGINARY FRIEND AND ITS STENCH, PAST ME.\n\nYOU ARE UNWORTHY OF A VOICE HERE, IF YOU DARED SAY I WAS WRONG. YOU DO NOT GET TO COME BACK AND SAY \"YOU'RE LESS RIGHT THAN YOU THINK\". YOU ARE UNWORTHY OF A VOICE. YOU ARE TOO STUPID TO EVEN SPEAK IN MY PRESENCE.\n\nTHIS GROUP IS NOT HIDDEN!\n\nYOU GET NO BENEFIT BEING A MEMBER, AND YOU ARE TOO DISGUSTINGLY IN LOVE WITH YOUR OWN BULLSHIT TO RISK HAVING IT STINK UP MY ENVIRONMENT.\n\nI'M NOT CHANGING THAT POLICY. EARN the PRIVILEGE of being HONOURED to have the chance I GRANT you to speak.\n\n...and that's more than your ilk deserve.",
