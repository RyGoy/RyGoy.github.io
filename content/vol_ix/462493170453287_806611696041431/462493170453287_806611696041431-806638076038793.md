   "message": "Um...\n\n...OK I'm going in.\n\nJoelle, you have learned more from me than any other single source in your life. If you claim that's not true, it just means you haven't been paying attention. :P\n\nIn ALL of that time, I have never endorsed the \"WRONG\" as an example of what NOT to do. There needs to be too many examples presented, to be useful.\n\nI'm not saying it doesn't have its uses, but those are rare cases.\n\nYou know who to REALLY thank, and you know HOW to show SINCERE GRATITUDE...\n\n...you just hate that you got all of what you are grateful for, from me. :P\n\n*Note: This will haunt you in your sixties. Remember I said it. :P",
