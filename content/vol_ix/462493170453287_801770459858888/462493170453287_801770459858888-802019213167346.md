   "message": "Hehe.\nI'm all fucked up cause of 15000 h of compulsory public schooling.\nCause I was raised by loving parents that did their best but didn't have time to understand,  they chose to be work-holics. \nI'm fucked cause I played to much games and didn't value the right things and that got me to think the wrong way. \nI'm still kinda fucked up cause there is remaining belief hanging around as well as that whole lying thing you suggested to avoid. \nTalking less will make my less fucked up.",
