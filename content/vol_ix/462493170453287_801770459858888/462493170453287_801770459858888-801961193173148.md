   "message": "Nice I think that makes sense. So my corporation  is doing the contracting in fiat. The person is paid \"in house\" currency.\nAnd obviously, when I got more understanding and balls, HighStephWorks liens the person STEPHANE BOUCHER and I officially resign from the system. Cause has we learn for a while now Person are not Corporation,  some Corporation are person but not all of them, person are the lowest legal entities on the chessboard. My objective is not to do commerce with the Person I administrate. Have no debt. \n\nAnd ideally have a fleet. ;(\n\nNow I gotta understand how to create the currency. ;)",
