   "message": "Those who benefit ME will do so by exploiting the coming age of abundance before it becomes \"mainstream\". I intend to teach those people how to control it, and lies won't work there.\n\nAt last count, there are 612 people who will live and die at my command, because they trust me. My oath to them existed long before they even knew I was alive. They can ALWAYS trust me. I've been Admiral for a couple of years now...\n\n...I can't recall the last ORDER I had to give. Everyone knows WHY I do what I do. I have more \"power\" than I've EVER had, and I am not afraid to admit that the temptation to wield it, keeps me up at night. 3 broadcasts, would deliver my enemies to me in the most horrific ways. That's all it would take. A meeting, and map, and a timetable. They'd execute it without question.They'd do it without question, for no other reason, than they trust me. I get \"scared into non-aggression\", because I couldn't betray that trust. It is something I struggle with, DAILY, and the answer is the same EVERY TIME!\n\nI think right, and value the right things. TRUST is VALUABLE, because it CANNOT BE BOUGHT!\n\nWe will be covering TRUST LAW, here soon, and I will block Derek Moran so everyone on fucking Facebook can read it BEFORE him!\n\nWHY?\n\nSee \"Gratuitous\", above. :D",
