   "message": "This morning and yesterday morning saw the raids of numerous private homes and the arrest of a number of people including a 16yr old boy... They were arrested for taking part in protests 3 months ago...\n\nThey have all been released without charge... \n\nStep 5 to systematically shutting down an open society... HARRASS CITIZEN'S GROUPS\n\nStep 7. Target key individuals...\n\nWhat bothers me is that a Facebook group with over 45,000 members in Ireland has posted a statute outlining \"your rights when being questioned\" etc...\n\nThey're telling people that a PERSON!! is only obliged to give a name and address while being questioned... \n\nWhat fucking hope do they have!",
