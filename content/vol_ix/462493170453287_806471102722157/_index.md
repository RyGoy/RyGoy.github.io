   "message": "From the \"WAR ON WRONG\" department.\n\nThis next monday, I will be in a situation where a LIEN will need to be registered on Qu�bec Revenu Agency :/\n\nI hate doing this, I'll rather do something else, but it seems there's nothing else to do :(\n\nI have sent a Notice of Claim, telling them that if I am wrong to just tell it to me in writing, and I will CANCEL the claim. No answer.\n\nI have sent an INVOICE, giving them the chance to tell me I am wrong, again. No answer.\n\nI have sent a Notice.\nI have sent a FINAL Notice\n\nI have sent a DEFAULT notice, again, telling them to tell me I am wrong, I have no rights to use the surety of the person to discharge public debts, and/or they don't have to recognize the Qu�bec Charter, and/or the Qu�bec Charter is not true, and/or the Qu�bec Charter is a joke, and/or I am a slave of this public debt......AND I WILL CANCEL ALL THIS.....\n\n:(",
