   "message": "Ward of the court! :D His officially a goverment AGENT, WITH SURETY! (You may be a DE FACTO AGENT with no surety, if one properly notices the concerned parties).\n\nThat means ALL of his seminars meant NOTHING (I REALLY want my money back!), and all his videos MUST be erased from the Internet to prevent more folks going to jail.\n\nDean has to realize that he is DONE trying to play the \"freeman\" card. And if he is wise, he must direcr ALL his traffic to The Tender for Law instead.",
