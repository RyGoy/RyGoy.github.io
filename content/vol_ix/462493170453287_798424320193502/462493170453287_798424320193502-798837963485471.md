   "message": "John Spirit is still Native. He will always view it from that perspective.\n\nHe does not see what is wrong with charging money, and I wouldn't demand that level of ethical integrity from him, any more than I would demand it from my cat. He simply CAN'T know any better.\n\n...nor should he be compelled. WE are the invaders, not him.\n\nThat isn't an endorsement to PAY him. Those who see the larger picture will see he has no value to sell. He IS telling the truth, and DOES do the world good by laying it all out there.\n\nHe just leaves out the part where they don't follow their own rules... EVER.",
