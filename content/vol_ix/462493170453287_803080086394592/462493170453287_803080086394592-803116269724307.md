   "message": "In the case of ONTARIO, I think the COLLECTION AGENCY is a PERSON that provides a SERVICE of obtaining or arranging for payment of money owed to another person, and employs an INDIVIDUAL (AGENT) authorized/appointed to COLLECT that money, called COLLECTOR.\n\nOne is the \"AGENCY\" with SURETY, the other is an \"AGENT\" for \"the agency.\" \n\nIt's curios that neither \"money\" \"debt\" \"debtor\" \"service\" \"agency,\" nor \"agent,\" are defined in the Act. So when the words \"the agency\", and others, are used  I am not sure which AGENCY they actually mean. i.e. << �collector� means an individual employed, appointed or authorized by a collection agency to collect debts for the agency,...>> Which AGENCY? :D\n\nAlso, apparently a \"collection agency\" may only collect MONEY OWED. Again, \"money\" is NOT defined in the Act. It does not collect DEBTS, but SELLS a SERVICE of DEBT SETTLEMENT. :D \n\nSO back to the question, <<WHY ARE \"COLLECTION AGENCY\" and \"COLLECTOR\" SEPARATE DEFINITIONS? >> Because they are NOT the same, for they exist and operate through AGENCY, and one is the AGENCY, and the other the AGENT. \n\nAs with everything else with \"agency,\" the authority for these \"collection agencies\" comes a from an unknown, magical place. It's clearly defined as a SERVICE.",
