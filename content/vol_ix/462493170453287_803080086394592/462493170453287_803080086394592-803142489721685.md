   "message": "I know a guy, who is a share holder of a collection agency.  \n\nHe said, after talking with me for 20 minutes, that he will never buy a debt with the name PIERRE DAOUST attached to itï¿½.. :P\n\nit seems to him that if he does, that debt will be sitting on his desk for a long period of time, and then he will have to find another collection agency to buy it, at very low cost, or, consider it in the losses....\n\nHe also know that he might end up with more debts.... :D\n\nThe funny thing is:  I \"NEVER\" refuse to PAY for any things I buy !! :/  ....go figure ....",
