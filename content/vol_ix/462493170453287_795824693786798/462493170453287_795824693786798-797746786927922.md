   "message": "I have taken notice of an insidious fact when the media is reporting about \"crimes\" committed by the \"slaves\". The media ALWAYS uses the word MAN, either in the heading title, or somewhere along the report, when addressing a \"slave\" committing a crime. You never hear the alleged figures of \"authority\" use MAN.\"Authorities\" use words like the \"suspect\" \"black male\" \"individual\" \"person of interest\" \"defendant\", but NEVER the word MAN.  But the MEDIA uses it quite often, specially in the titles/headings.\n\nJust something I have noticed.",
