He said he also had a conversation with Hernandez on June 19.\n\n\"I asked him why he'd lawyered up,\" he said.\n\nThe judge struck the comment from the record and instructed the jury that citizens do not have any obligation to speak with police.\"\n\nand\n\n\"Kraft [Bob Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots] at times seemed uncomfortable on the stand, even when he was asked where he worked. He first said 1 Patriot Place, the address of Gillette Stadium. When asked what he did at work, he replied, \"Whatever they ask me to do.\"\n\nThen, asked if he ran a business, he replied: \"We're a packaging and paper business and private equity, and we have two sports teams.\" He first listed the New England Revolution soccer team, then the Patriots.\"\n\n",
