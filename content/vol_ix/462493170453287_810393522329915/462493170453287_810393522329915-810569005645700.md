On Aug. 20, 2013 Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian said the Wynne government had provided \"inaccurate and incomplete information in my initial investigation\" about the ability to retrieve deleted emails. \"As a direct consequence of the incomplete response, the public has been misled�about the ability of staff to retrieve potentially relevant information.� [24]\n\nOn March 27, 2014 a court document became public in which the OPP stated they had probable cause to lay criminal charges against David Livingston, McGuinty�s last chief of staff. The document alleged Livingston hired an IT contractor to the Liberal Party, David Faist (who was also the common-law partner of the Premier's Office staffer Laura Miller), to wipe clean the hard drives of computers in the Premier's Office that contained information about the gas plant scandal. Police say the hard drives will �afford evidence� of breach of trust. Mr. Faist and Ms. Miller had since moved to British Columbia where Ms. Miller became the Executive Director of the BC Liberal Party. They were scheduled to give evidence to the Justice Policy Committee of the Legislature when an election was called, suspending the activity of the committee. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_power_plant_scandal http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Wynne",
