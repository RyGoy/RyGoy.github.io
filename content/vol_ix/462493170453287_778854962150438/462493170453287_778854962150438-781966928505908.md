I am taking this very seriously.\nSo I have learned how and the why.\nI have asked why all my life and it led me here.\nIt is my wish to train AI's, Go Crypto and engage in smart contracts.\n\nLessons learned in the last 2 years in this forum:\n.     \n   Planning and prep are critical\nFuck how it feels, learn it. If you do not retain it... re read it again and again and then one more time.\nIf you think wrong you will act wrong unless you learn, a different way.\nSeriously ,for research and education purposes only\n\nFuck the Crown \nGod save the Queen\n\nP.s.
