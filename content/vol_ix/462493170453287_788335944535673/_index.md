   "message": "Here's something I discovered today Admiral Scott that I think will interest you. THE CORPORATION OF THE CITY OF MISSISSAUGA has introduced a new \"ADMINISTRATIVE Penalty System\". Agents can now issue PENALTY NOTICES. These are separate from PARKING INFRACTION NOTICES. What does this mean? Under the new system the charge is INDISPUTABLE. Really. This is the word the agent behind the window used as she explained that there is no option for a court date any longer and that one can't be requested. Only a \"Sreening Request\" can be made and the new process requires folks complete a form which also discloses $85 in extra fees if someone does not show up for the appointment which includes a $50 \"affirmation penalty and a non-appearance fee\", a $25 late fee and a $10 MTO search fee.",
