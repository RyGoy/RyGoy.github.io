You are doing the Adam Thomas equivalent of \"buck-o-five\"; but the information you are apparently holding over everyone's head is not even original.  Scott always tells the truth and always discloses information.  You may be doing one of these things, but certainly not both.  If you have something to say, say it.  Otherwise, say nothing.  You have not earned the right to arrogantly demean others in this group.\n\nApologies to the group - I'm out of smokes.",
