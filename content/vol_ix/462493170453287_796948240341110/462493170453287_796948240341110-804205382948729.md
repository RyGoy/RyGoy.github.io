   "message": "Cute? :/ I thought Epiphany was cute when I first met her. She's not cute anymore. But, she is adorable. She's like a 400lb gorilla that you wake up with along with a hangover. She's a stinking hairy ape monkey I can't get off my back, BUT, I do \"love\" her and she's all mine. ;) \n\nShe settling in nicely btw (aka she's moved in, making a mess, wreaking havoc, and taking complete control of everything and behaving like a total dictator). She's allowed herself the freedom to avoid any hesitation whatsoever about repeatedly hitting me on the head and telling me what an idiot I am - especially when I think of something idiotic to say. Reminds me of Scott that way. Oh, and get this; whenever I have company, she is such a darling - she's granted herself an irrevocable license to whisper insults in my ear about my friends, with questions like \"How'd you end up with this idiot?\" Isn't she a peach!? :)",
