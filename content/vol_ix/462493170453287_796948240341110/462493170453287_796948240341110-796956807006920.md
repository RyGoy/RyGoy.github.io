   "message": "It took me a couple of years to figure out. :(\n\nThanks to Scott, the answer was always in front of my/our face. He NEVER hid it. And even though he told us/me, I couldn't hear it. I couldn't see it. He could say it plainly; as plainly as it CAN be said, and I still could see it. \n\nIn fact, he posted the answer AGAIN AND AGAIN and I still didn't have a fucking clue.\n\nI confess that secretly, I thought he was a tad arrogant. I apologize Scott. That was a a FUCKING BIG MISTAKE!!",
