   "message": "The Piece-of-Shit Christians still read this group by the hundreds.\n\nThey're just muzzled. It's nice. I get to point out that I'M BETTER THAN JESUS because I ACTUALLY GIVE REAL FUCKING ANSWERS, and I'M NOT IMAGINARY!\n\n...and all the Piece-of-Shit Christians can do is tremble in impotent fury, as I rub their hypocrisy in their faces. How does that feel, Piece-of-Shit Christians? How does it feel knowing your \"all knowing\" imaginary friend can't give you the same insight I have?\n\nHow does it feel, KNOWING that what I say is right, and there's no way to benefit from that knowledge, without you admitting that your Piece-of-Shit Christian \"god\" is just an inherited delusion, and that you are the piece of shit I say you are?\n\nHOW DOES THAT FEEL?\n\n...oh that's right! YOU CAN'T ANSWER! :D",
