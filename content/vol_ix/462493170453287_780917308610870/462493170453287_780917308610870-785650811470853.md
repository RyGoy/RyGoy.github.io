   "message": "Craig Blacksmith13 hrs � Edited � \nHo mitakuyapi.\n  Something to ponder if ur interested.  We were in court yesterday  challenging Canadian jurisdiction.  Comments have been made that in  today's world we will never be given a fair trial because we carry  around drivers licenses, status cards, pay bills, use Canadian money etc  etc.  \n Here's our position on this as Dakota Oyate. \n Yes we are in \"their\" court. Yes we carry around drivers licence, status cards etc.\n  Our take on this is that the government gave them themselves authority  over the indian July 1, 1867 when the constitution was passed.  \n  Included in their law was section 91 which is a unilateral (passing laws  on their own) granting of federal authority.  Currency, banking,  taxation, marriage, divorce, postal service etc.\n These are all standard government authorities.  \n What isn't standard is #24 on the list:\n Indians and lands reserved for indians.\n Keep in mind \"Canada\" at the time was on the east coast and along the north shores of the Great Lakes.\n It wasn't \"Canada\" as it is today.\n  Our Dakota Oyate refused to surrender \"sign treaty\" so a refugee theory  was established and other tribes signed away the western prairie  provinces.\n Today, we have completely blown their fabricated history and exposed it as lies.  \n  In addition to this is the indian act which was passed into law in  1876.  The indian act makes the \"indian\" in section 91.24 a legal  permanent ward of the government.  \n This why it states in the  indian act that our lands are to be held in trust for our use and  benefit with the federal government as trustee.\n (great white father)\n  So as legal wards we are not bound by their laws outside of the indian  act.  We are not capable of administering ourselves so everything done,  drivers licenses, registration, passports etc are all within this indian  act for our benefit.\n Now as Dakota Oyate, we will not negotiate as \"indians\" today as was the case back in the 1860's.  \n  We have documented history of our alliance with the British and we see  \"Canada\" as a creation of the British government not as a nation.  \n The British are only sovereign on their lands.  We are sovereign here.  \n We will not enter into a treaty with a corporate entity which is what the British North America Act (Canada) is.\n We are in their court because it was the only way we could legally challenge jurisdiction.\n  As the constitutional lawyer for canada states \"no court has  countenanced such an argument\".  If no court countenanced it, how can  there be legal precedent.\n Canada cannot have it both ways. Either  \"indians\" are wards (children, mentally incompetent, animals) with no  legal responsibilities or \"indians\" are human beings that are being  subjected to war crimes by stripping us of our humanity.\n Canada is not a sovereign nation. \n We are.\nLike �  � Share\n42 people like this.\n11 shares\nTraci Braaten 12 hrs � Like\nNic Leech Best wishes for this case.12 hrs � Like � 1\nNic Leech I  would suggest a case based on being forced to use these forms of  identification because to do anything else would once - and still could -  be cited as revolutionary activities....with all the potential  consequences. \nUnder current geo-political circumstances,  it could be considered as terrorism to refuse. \n - Ultimate hypocrisy. ...See More11 hrs � Like\nLarry Douglas Great work, craig. keep us informed.6 hrs � Like � 1\nWrite a comment...\n\nCrystal Marie34 mins � \nOmg so just got up from a nap safe to say I'll b up all night\nLike �  � Share\nDarren Sinclair Welcome to my world28 mins � Like\nCrystal Marie Aww muffin insomnia is my world 26 mins � Like\nDarren Sinclair Muffin insomniac22 mins � Like",
