   "message": "Why is there no discussion on Section 91.24? \nSection 91 is federal legislative authority.\nNumber 24 is one of 29 items listed under Canadian authority. The other items include currency, banking, lighthouses, military, taxation, postal service etc. \n.24 Indians and lands reserved for indians.\nThree questions need to be answered.\n1. What is an \"indian\".\n2. Who gave canada authority to govern?\n3. What is the amount held in trust from our lands under the indian act?\nAnd please keep the comments to the statement and the questions. We' re tired of hearing the same surrender treaty nonsense. Spirit and intent is lawyer jibberish meant to draw attention away from section 91.24.\n\nis this one of the things it is too late to make a difference over from 1982 uk canada act?",
