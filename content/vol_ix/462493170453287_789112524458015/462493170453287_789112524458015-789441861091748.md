   "message": "As a super-deluxe bonus...the difference between \"good\" and \"well\".\n\nGood is an adjective.  This means you correctly use it with a noun.\n\nGood job, good dog, good work, are all correct uses of the word.\n\nWell is an adverb, which means that it modifies verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs.\n\nWell, is well used in these situations, i.e.\n\nYou speak English well.",
