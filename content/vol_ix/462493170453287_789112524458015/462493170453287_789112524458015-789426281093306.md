   "message": "Honouring an obligation you entered into willingly does not, in my opinion, illustrate thinking wrong and valuing the wrong things.  It might suggest more thinking and planning should have preceded the decision.  Other issues you mention, while not ideal,  can be temporary, but may be necessary in the short term to honour this, and other, commitments.  If you don't like your situation, change it.\n\nI asked you to verify your previous statement as I was unclear whether it was true, or if it was meant to \"soften\" a negative statement about others.  \n\nThe point I was ultimately going to make (again) is that your only valuable resource is time.  It is finite and non-renewable.  You should care how you spend your time, and care when your time, or that of others, is being wasted.  \n\nWhen Scott declares people \"think wrong and value the wrong things\" it is not an invitation to parrot back the obvious.  It is a learning tool by which you might explore what you value, and to make changes if appropriate.   If I were labelled an \"idiot\" for instance, I would try to understand why this was true and correct it.  In possession of this information I would not then think all my issues could be explained away by declaring that I was \"still an idiot\".",
