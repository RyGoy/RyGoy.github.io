   "message": "I probably didn't mention it, but did you know Dean C. Clifford actually sat INSIDE a genesis block mine and asked \"what if the server goes down\"?\n\nHe then told everyone who would listen that I was crazy, so YOU would miss out on what's TRUE, and \"donate\". To him... \"Scott Duncan is just crazy and mean... pay NO attention to him and if I catch you speaking ACTUAL truth, I'll know it came from Scott Duncan, and I'll block/ban you... oh  and Jesus!\" \n\nMike Friesen can bear witness to that, can't you, Mike? :D",
