   "message": "Just for fun, I decided to look up my hometown courthouse on Dun and Bradstreet. I was having some difficulty locating it under the expected name, \"Norfolk County Courthouse\", so I turned to Google. My search results turned up this:\n\nhttps://www.google.ca/#q=norfolk+county+courthouse%2C+simcoe%2C+ontario+\n\nHow interesting. The top result is \"Ministry of the Attorney General; courthouse.\" Okay, let's punch that into dnb.ca and see what we get:\n\nhttps://www.dnbexpress.ca/search_results.asp \n\nWhen I was last in this courthouse back in 2012, the listing was \"Government of Ontario, Operating As: Justice.\" Now it's \"Regional Health Authority - Central Manitoba Inc, Operating As: Minister Of The Attorney General\"",
