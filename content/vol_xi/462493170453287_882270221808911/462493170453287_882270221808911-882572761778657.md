   "message": "They \"reorganize\" every 3 years or so. If it happens every year (like Toronto) it means they have too much shit they can get called on...\n\n...and if anyone comes after them, they say, \"oh, that was before the 'restructuring'. That's the OTHER government workers. We aren't like that, and there's nothing we can do to fix it\". It's stupid and transparent, and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nThe reason Manitoba is holding the bag, is because the FEDERAL government WILL NOT ACCEPT SURETY. They are stuck with Manitoba (Also rejected by the Feds for surety), so they put corrupt courts under that umbrella.\n\nIf you have a FOUNDATION IDENTITY (Birth Certificate) that has ONLY ONE signature, then you are in a region that the federal government (Canada) will NOT be responsible for, if constitutional violations occur. It's why the jails are full, even though 2013 was one of the LEAST violent years in history.",
