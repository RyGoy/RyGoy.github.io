   "message": "\"It is what it is\" may be the single dumbest expression in history.  Like religion it is the end of rational thought.  In the case of this particular filler conversation, the speaker declares there is nothing rational to think, and decides not to pursue any course that might ameliorate the situation i.e. \"Well, there's nothing we can do to change it...it is what it is\".  Stupid!  Stupid! Stupid.\n\nI hereby ban this statement and will smite anyone who uses it.",
