   "message": "awww, Thanks Tara, my neck is kinked from sleeping on that roll. I'll get one today. So I went back to the house this morning to get toiletries and my bicycle, Karens mom was there and let me in, thats gonna piss her off. according to karens mom the cops last night asked her if they could arrest me, Karen told them no, there was no violence or threats, they say not to worry, they could find something to charge me with. her brother also and  called the police and said I threatened her with death. guess I'll be getting the 911 tapes, police book notes and incident reports. I will get that bank draft but the malice, cruelty and vexatious behaviors is reason enough to see her get audited.",
