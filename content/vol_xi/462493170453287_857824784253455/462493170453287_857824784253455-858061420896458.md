   "message": "Notice that UNLIKE Menard, I don't lie about words and omit stuff.\nI'm still the ONLY one in the  ONLY one who ACTUALLY tells the truth.\n\nLet that sink in. I AM A UNIQUE case. The law society can fight you, but not me. You cannot tell the truth if you don't know what the truth IS. They made me. The truth comes with that process.\n\nPass on what I show you. I am not the knowledge, nor am I the source. YOU ARE.\n\nThese past few years I've shown you:\n\nWHAT the truth is.\nWHAT is responsible for it.\n\nYou have the means of getting the truth: WHAT do you do about it?\n\nIn 2016 we will show you. It won't just be me, either! Several of my captains will be joining us! It seems our humble little group has inspired more than I had first anticipated!\n\nRemember: I'm the distraction to keep those very same captains hidden! Some want to be part of the distraction. Who am I to argue?\n\n...wait. I'm the Admiral. That's my DEFINED RIGHT! :D",
