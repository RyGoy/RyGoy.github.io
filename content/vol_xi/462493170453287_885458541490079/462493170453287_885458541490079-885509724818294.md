   "message": "Fun Fact: SOCRATES: Latin form of Greek Sokrates, means \"whole power.\"  Socrates was a man's name - in fact he would be equivalent to the \"Steve\" of the Western world.\n\nAccording to historical documentation, Socrates was a man who worked as a stone mason, performed military service, got married, produced three sons, and was regarded as one of the great philosophers of early Rome.  To the average person this information is largely anecdotal.  That said, if there was a Socrates he was probably male in that an education for women (of any kind) was virtually non-existent.  Further, no other learned man would suffer public discourse or debate with a mere woman -- much like the situation we find ourselves in today.",
