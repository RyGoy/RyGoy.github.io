   "message": "Over the years we have sampled dozens of different blends from chain coffee-shops to mom & pop shops to specialty places, including companies that roast their own beans.  We have spent ridiculous money on Hawaiian, Blue Mountain, and have even tried coffee previously eaten and digested by the Asian palm civet.\n\nCeit and Scott mentioned our current \"favorite\" which is a replacement for our former first choice Colombian coffee, also from Timothy's, and discontinued for no reason they could describe.\n\nWe are just that serious about this addiction; however, we can currently only speak with authority regarding medium roasts.   Probably coffee from Costa Rica would be awesome.  We'll be interested in your opinion (David-Paul) - have a great trip.",
