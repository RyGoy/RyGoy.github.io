   "message": "This just in....Timothy's is out.  Zavida Coffee Roasters coffee is in - here's why.  \n\nWe dropped by one of their new locations and they invited us to try several of their coffees for free.  Not a taste, but whole cups of coffee.  All of their blends are great.  Their coffee is less expensive per pound than at other coffee shops.  The staff is competent and unfailingly cheerful - not man-bun hipster cheerful...they actually seem to like their jobs.  We started buying their privately labelled Zavida coffee pods by the bucket load.  When our Keurig machine met an untimely end and we found the new models have DRM restrictions, we were left with several pounds of unusable product.  Zavida refunded our purchase and replaced it with coffee beans of higher value as we went \"manual\".  Once I called the number on their web site to see if the shop was still open (it wasn't) and the owner called me back from his personal cell phone and chatted about the company. There is nothing about this place we don't like.\n\nAlso...fuck dolphins.",
