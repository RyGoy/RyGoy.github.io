   "message": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary_public\n\nAre they public notaries?\n\n\"A notary public (or notary or public notary) of the common law is a public officer constituted by law to serve the public in non-contentious matters usually concerned with estates, deeds, powers-of-attorney, and foreign and international business.\"\n\nAre you asking them to do something outside of their jurisdiction perhaps?\n\n\"Canadian notaries public (except in the Province of British Columbia and Quebec) are very much like their American counterparts, generally restricted to administering oaths, witnessing signatures on affidavits and statutory declarations, providing acknowledgements, certifying true copies, and so forth.\"\n\nDid you question anything or simply take NO for an answer from a public servant?\n\nI am sure that there is more to this story.",
