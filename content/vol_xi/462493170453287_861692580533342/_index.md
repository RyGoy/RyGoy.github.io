   "message": "So, in one of the recent threads, someone mentioned that it was getting difficult to find a Notary to notarize documents. I think it was Pete Daoust who mentioned it.\n\nAnyways, today I was off to get a document notarized myself. I have had little experience with the notary process, and what experience I have had, was with guys whose primary occupation is that of a lawyer. They seem to have the notary market locked down pretty good. Those few times I have had it done, it was about 40 bucks per document as an average. These lawyers also seem to want to read everything I've written as if they are being asked for their opinions or something.\n\nBut, as I was on my way to this new notary, I had to walk past this public building that had the words TOWN HALL on the front of it. I decided to go in and ask if perhaps they had a Public Notary in that public building... They did! The Secretary tells me that although he is not in today, he does notarize documents, and there is no charge.\n\nThat guy is not listed in the phone book, so I thought I'd mention it to you all.",
