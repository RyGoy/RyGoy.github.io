   "message": "Kent Barrett, the bank manager (CIBC) here that I spoke with explained to me that their head office has instructed them NOT to notarize anymore. She's been there 40 years and manager for 30 (not that it matters)... She says that they still do certified true copies for clients of the bank for free, but do not notarize.\n\nAt the town hall, I have had no luck, the guy is apparently off with a sore back, but I will keep you all posted.\n\nAt another location, which was a law office, they have a commissioner of oaths available for \"some\" documents, which they didn't specify, but they will only do that for stuff staying in the province. The notary there is also a lawyer, I did not speak to him though.\n\nIt looks like all of the actual notaries here are also lawyers.",
