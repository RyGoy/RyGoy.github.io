   "message": "Scott.\n\nI have 2 questions, and I was wondering if you could point me to where I can learn more about them.\n\nThe first has to do with an anonymization box. You spoke briefly about one last fall on one of those conference calls. I think you had said that Humanmachines was working on something that would be about 50 dollars, or could be built yourself. Where might I find more information about that?\n\nThe second question comes from a combination of one of your articles, and from a tidbit of another call. In the article, you spoke of your old network being available now that you've moved on to the newer one, and in the call you spoke about live booting a computer off of an encrypted USB stick, all of the user data would be on the network. I think that those two comments go together and I would like to learn more about that as well. Could you point me in the right direction to learn more please?",
