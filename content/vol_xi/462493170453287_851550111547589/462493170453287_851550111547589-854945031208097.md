   "message": "\"Thanking someone, while polite and pleasant, is an essentially hollow gesture... If you deify someone you must, by extrapolation, believe that \"gifts\" are afforded by some higher power. This essentially frees the bestower of this homage from any responsibility for personal development, as it excuses the lesser efforts of mere mortal men.\"  \n\n:)  Tara I wish I could pinpoint what it is about your words that I absolutley love beyond the truth in them.  Perhaps its because you have a remarkable ability to succinctly express many things that I have observed and present it in a way that folks can easily observe for themselves if they stop to think. Whatever it may be your words usually leave a smile on my face.",
