   "message": "Ok, here�s a TRUE story�\n\nA year ago, a PERSON I happen to have FULL trust in, bought 22 skids of shit from Hydro-Quebec (the irony :D ).\n\nIn that lot of 22 skids, there was 4 skids filled with VCR�s. And of course the PERSON I happen to have full TRUST in, haven�t bought this lot for these fucking VCR�s, in fact, the plan was to trash them. The other 18 skids left was more interesting for that PERSON ;) \n\nBut out of the black, a man came from nowhere, he told me he was NOT a nigger, but a French man from Haiti. I have no idea why he said that, but he said it�.\n\nAnyway, this No-Nigger French Black man from Haiti have bought ALL these VCR�s, for $5 each :/\n\nHe made a few trip back and forth with his 1989 Ford Aerostar to pick them up.\n\nSo I KNOW that some folks somewhere are still using these dinosaurs�.there was 153 of these VCR�s. And that NON-NIGGER Black man from Haiti, told me that these things would be put in a container, and be shipped to Haiti.\n\nNot my fault :/",
