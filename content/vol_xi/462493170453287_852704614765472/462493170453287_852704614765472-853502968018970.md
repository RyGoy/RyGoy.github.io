For no less than 20 corporations, I am an ASSET!\n\nThat's 20 LEGITIMATE copyright claims under DMCA laws in the US. Youtube taught us ALL that COPYRIGHT is the MOST IMPORTANT FUCKING THING IN THE WORLD, so courts are REALLY receptive to companies with LEGITIMATE claims!\n\nI\"LL LOVE watching you try to attach me to \"FMOL\" or \"Sovereign Citizens\" in the context of the ASSET HOLDER suing your ass. I'll be VERY reasonable with my fees to them, and I hope they pass the savings on to you, Quatlosers. :D",
