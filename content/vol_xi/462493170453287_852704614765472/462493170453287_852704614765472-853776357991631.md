[Latin \"something said\nin passing\"] (18c) A judicial comment made while delivering\na judicial opinion, but one that is unnecessary to\nthe decision in the case and therefore not precedential\n(although it may be considered persuasive). Often\nshortened to dictum or, less commonly, obiter. PI. obiter\ndicta. See DICTUM. Cf. HOLDING (1); RATIO DECIDENDI.\n[Cases: Courts C=>92.]\n\"Strictly speaking an 'obiter dictum' is a remark made\nor opinion expressed by a judge, in his decision upon a\ncause, 'by the way' that is, incidentally or collaterally,\nand not directly upon the question before the court; or it\nis any statement of law enunciated by the judge or court\nmerely by way of illustration, argument, analogy, or sugï¿½\ngestion. .. In the common speech of lawyers, all such\nextrajudicial expressions of legal opinion are referred to\nas 'dicta,' or 'obiter dicta,' these two terms being used\ninterchangeably.\" William M.
