   "message": "I have more respect for the Quatlosers. They actually believe the lies they make up. They really do. \n\nWhat they DON'T do is claim I've \"changed their life\" and pretend to REALLY WANT TO COMPENSATE. \n\nI ask that questions get answered.\n\nI ask the lies be silenced.\n\nI ask that promises be kept.\n\nNEVER anything big. NEVER anything that costs you. Yet it's always \"too much\".\n\nFuck all of you.",
