   "message": "Chris Evan, I REALLY see you trying, but this is actually defamation in the way they are trying against me.\n\nWhen it's used against THEM, it doesn't make it \"valid\".\n\n1: Everything they say is TRUE, but sold as \"crazy\", and of course it's REPORTED. It's not even BELIEVED...just REPORTED.\n\n2: Rape doesn't suddenly become \"OK\" when it happens to a woman you dislike.\n\n3: Fraud, and Lawyer Lies don't suddenly become OK, if it's used against Quatloos.\n\nClear?\n\nNO solution I provide will EVER work, if the standards are \"fluid\". They are EQUAL for EVERYONE, or it will FAIL.",
