   "message": "Also, the entire thread was introduced by saying that they have been ignoring you for months.....as everyone else should be doing to.  The only reason that they would even discuss you is because you brought it up.....well, lets look what he's done recently....oh, look at this Meads OPCA article, it's just regular Scott jibberish.  Don't waste your time.  Oh, by the way, does he have any court cases he's won? (That's my favorite rebuttal as dismissed isn't recorded....)  That's like asking if the Red Sox are a good football team, then making the answerer prove by showing how many Superbowls they won.  It's just stupid.  There are enough examples of the root being surety and accounting just in here to support what Scott teaches.",
