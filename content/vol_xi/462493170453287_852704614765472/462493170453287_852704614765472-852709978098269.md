Silence.\n\nAll of you assholes LOVE to FUCKING GUSH about HOW MUCH you want to FUCKING THANK me for ALL YOU'VE LEARNED, and you BEG for things to compensate me for my time, and offer money, but the SECOND I make my wishes KNOWN, then ALL of you provide an excuse.\n\n@Andrew FatOne [https://www.facebook.com/spyder666] thought the \"free speech rights\" of a piece-of-Shit Christian was more important than any debt owed to me. It's why Tara Duncan publicly trashes him, whenever he tries to leave the impression that he is \"inner circle\".\n\nFrom then until now, you are ALL the same. I always ask a TINY thing, and it's always when your lying hypocrisy SHINES THROUGH.",
