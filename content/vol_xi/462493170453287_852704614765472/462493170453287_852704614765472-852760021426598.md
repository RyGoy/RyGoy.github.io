   "message": "Truth is terrorism these days. Poor Bin Laden. He's killed people, and shit, and I'm going to be in the same category. Everyone's OK with that, too. \n\n...I'll be a \"Terrorist\" for telling the truth. That's it.\n\nLet's make sure it's REALLY terrifying truth I tell then. The RIGHT people will have LOTS to be afraid of. They constructed me. I have SO MUCH to tell.\n\nYou see, when you try to make your cover stories about me \"The truth\", it means I am not breaking ANY agreement.  I'm just a \"crazy\" guy who's served LOTS of \"time\"...\n\n...except HUNDREDS of people interacted with me. For YEARS. What about all the places YOU deployed me to. THEY sure remember me! Are you going to threaten them into silence? :D Bad plan. I've prepared for it :D\n\nFix your errors, or I will tell you a story...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GoVLhUxhdSw",
