   "message": "After the LAST case I won, the Deputy Attorney General sent his assistant with a message; \"If you come back, you do so with the understanding that you will be compelled to service\".\n\nIf I come in with my little \"Poor Pro Se Defendant\" act again, they'd force me to be a JP.\n\n...I'd rather be dead.\n\nI never appeared Pro Se after that.\n\nThey stopped pretending to follow the rules then.\n\nIt turns out they ALWAYS had a Dog-and-Pony show ready for me.\n\nI look at The Fender's record, and the courts were lying sacks of shit since the 1980's. They were \"playing straight\" for the Reject from the Nobility. It was ALWAYS COMPLETELY corrupt, and they put on a SHOW for me.\n\nDid I WIN?\n\nFUCK YEAH! ALL THE FUCKING TIME! I used to pick fights because I WANTED people to sue me. I ALWAYS won.\n\n...and it was always an act. It doesn't MATTER if I won. It was a lie.",
