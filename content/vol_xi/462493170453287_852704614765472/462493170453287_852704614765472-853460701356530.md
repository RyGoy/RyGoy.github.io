   "message": "Since you brought up Marc Stevens, and I had to look into him... Perhaps a quote straight from him on this very subject might be of interest.\n\n\"Quatloos are the guys who stand around insisting the �emperor� has clothes.  While those who see the irrefutable truth � governments have no voluntary support � are denounced as liars, idiots and morons.  Yeah, facts really are stubborn things.  Despite all the name calling, governments still have no voluntary support.  Spin that.  Telling me to move will not change the facts either.\n\nIf I presented my services to the market the way governments do, quatloos would denounce me as a criminal, at least until I labeled myself a government.\"",
