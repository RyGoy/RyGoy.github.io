   "message": "If you tell a woman \"well you're a disgusting,ugly, skank, but I'll fuck you anyway\", you've kind of neutralized the insult yourself!\n\nOne does not VALIDATE fraud by tolerating it.\n\nTHEY claim YOU are the \"fraud\", but only YOU can show injury.\n\nThey don't apply their own standards to themselves. You do not negotiate with that. You eliminate it.\n\nIt's a lesson THEY TAUGHT ME.\n\nLEARN MY LESSON. NEVER EVER GIVE ANY QUARTER TO A LAWYER! NOTHING!\n\nI'll accept a proposal from the Law Society and/or Attorney General, when the head of Wailan Low is in a pike, outside Osgoode Hall, as a warning to all \"Society\" members, that committing fraud comes at too high a price.\n\nOnly on that day will I accept ANY proposal for communication.\n\nDo that, and your debt is paid. I'll even offer 2 years less one day of tenure as JP, as your change.\n\nI'LL EVEN CLEAR LOW'S CASELOAD FOR FREE!\n\nA bargain at twice the price!\n\n...and not very likely. Pity. The Newspapers would have a field day. The Law & Order type politicians could REALLY sell it, ala \"Well it's the law, no matter how obscure, and if you look at his rulings, they are always in the INTEREST OF JUSTICE\" ;)\n\n...PEACE! :D",
