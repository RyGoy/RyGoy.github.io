   "message": "Below is a quote from their post about trolling.\n\nThe more I read it the more I see how inverted everything is. \n\nTheir modus operandi is: someone who see's through their shit must be the ones who don't understand. The more you understand the crazier you are! It's a fabricated matrix of lies and deception that they are protecting. They fear that everything which presently sustains them will fall if what we are learning/learnt (WE ALREADY WON) becomes public knowledge. \n\nThey fear not only losing there way of life, they fear that we may think beyond their \"solutions\" and \"truth\" and that in the end, they might loose their heads. The benefit of their bullshit is that they keep their heads.\n\nIt seems to be a blatent textbook case of a Freudian slip; a confession of sorts!\n\nWithout further delay:\n\n\"They tend to have highly developed and irrational beliefs, mostly through their \"education\", and hold those beliefs strong. Any one who disagrees with those beliefs is an idiot or trying to hold them down. If you try to censor them then Godwin's Law comes into effect. They will resent any actual help trying to further their education by declaiming and trying to denigrate other's education or background.\"",
