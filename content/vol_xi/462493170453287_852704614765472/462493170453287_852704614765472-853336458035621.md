   "message": "The biggest threats are those who use the word \"peace\". People who use the word \"peace\" are always the first to lie, and inflict violence. History proves it time and again.\n\nMao killed everyone with a grade 6 education or higher... to secure \"peace\".\n\nPeople who END what they say with \"peace\" should justly shot for doing so, to save any further violence.\n\nThe use of the word \"peace\" is much like \"Big Beautiful Women\" - It's a lie, because it was said.\n\nIf something is BEAUTIFUL, you don't need to try to convince people of it.\n\nIf your INTENT is PEACEFUL, you don't have to convince people of it.\n\nGET IT?",
