   "message": "\"The normal Scott Duncan Gibberish. I haven't yet bothered to read the Facebook posting all the way through so I don't know if he actually has anything relevant to say about Meads.\" - REALLY?\n\nDid ANY of you have this hard of a time reading that article? Did ANY of you \"stop halfway through\"?\n\nCan ANYONE except the liar who wrote this, relate to that \"experience\". Message me, if you gave up halfway through.\n\nI want to know if ANYONE exists that can honestly use the following as a REALISTIC statement?\n\nWas ANY LIVING MAN OR WOMAN EVER in the position where they couldn't make it through, and don't know if there's a point?!?\n\nEVER?\n\nI demand 3 people declaring this as their experience, before I'll even accept it as a POSSIBILITY! Do you see the fantasy puppets they try to make you into?\n\nWhy would you invent a story like that and act like \"it's perfectly normal\"? THAT is TRULY a psychopath. No REAL WORLD empathy, just bullshit you are supposed to accept as \"normal\" because he said so.\n\nAm I the only one who sees a REAL diseased mind here?",
