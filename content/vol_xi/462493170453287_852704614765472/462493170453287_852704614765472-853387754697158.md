   "message": "Marc Stevens got the same Lie-Fest from Quatloos {http://marcstevens.net/} but he doesn't deal with them properly. He's be pretty effective if the courts followed their own rules anymore. Marc Stevens is pretty \"entry level\" when it comes to law, which is essential. We need the Marc Stevens and Christopher Cantwells, and the Hosey Josie The Outlaws, and yes, even the Larken Roses.\n\nTHOSE are the ones that get people asking the very basic questions. People like the HUMAN MACHINES INITIATIVE are for the people who answer those basic questions, and have MORE questions, like \"what other choice is there\".\n\nThat's where I come in.\n\nI'm ALWAYS 5 years ahead of the rest of you. That's not \"ego\", that's just fact. The quicker you grasp that, the more you can exploit.\n\nThink about it. This whole group is a PUBLIC RECORD of a 3 year period. People who follow it from the beginning will see a record of FUTURE KNOWLEDGE.\n\nIt's not \"magic\". It's just hard to learn :/\n\nDon't try to copy me, take what I show you and EXPLOIT IT! Kent Barrett is the only one to get THAT message! (Still unsure as to why I'm a Skeleton though).",
