   "message": "Do i have any COURT CASES I've won?\n\nI WON THEM ALL! THE ONLY TIME I DIDN'T WAS WHEN THEY LIED, CHEATED AND ALTERED THE COURT RECORD.\n\nIf the Quatlosers wish to \"challenge\" me on that, I will play the audio recording of the hearing, with Debrah Knight secured in the hold of one of my vessels. I will have a Golf Club with the word \"\"QUATLOOS\" engraved in it, and a crewman (of another navy, of course) will club Deborah Knight with every word she edited or removed. She'll probably survive the first paragraph.\n\nWould THAT be an adequate demonstration?",
