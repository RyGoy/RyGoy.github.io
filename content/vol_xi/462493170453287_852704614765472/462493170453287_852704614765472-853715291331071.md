   "message": "This is the entire comment of a poster named Eric: (this has been cut and pasted earlier and Scott dissected it...but there isn't even one single shred of truth to the entire post)\n\nHmmm, personally I would just call him a rather nasty little man with an over-inflated sense of his own importance. Let me see, a Toronto boy, been around long enough that he can recognize the area down around the old Tip Top building and Front Street. Believes he is God's gift to computer science but from what I can tell has only audited a few CS 101 courses. Stirs up trouble on various FMOTL sites by claiming:\na. they have stolen his ideas;\nb. they aren't radical enough;\nc. various people are agents of the government or CIBC bank.\nBasic strawman/natural person arguments with one novel self addition - the \"affidavit of mistake\". Self appointed admiral of his own fleet under mercantile law. Somehow he has obtained a small group of followers who enjoy being abused by him.\n\nNot one shred of truth here....not one!\n\nBut it set the platform for the rest of the idiots to use.....interesting mechanism.",
