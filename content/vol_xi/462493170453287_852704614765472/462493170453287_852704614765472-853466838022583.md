   "message": "The Quatloos site is run by a lawyer under the guise of a non-profit do-gooder corporation, so he can shield himself from any backlash. They want to discredit you for the same reason that Dan-lien-your-name Wilson did. They are trying so very hard to prevent people from learning what you have to say. \nAll of this appears to be in an effort to PREVENT anyone, by way of logical fallacies, spin, sophistry etc., from getting to the point of placing a lien on their name and removing themselves from the system. \nThey ALL profit as parasites off of the host, and Scott Duncan is the only one showing the host how to remove the parasite(s).",
