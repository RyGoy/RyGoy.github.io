   "message": "\"How do THEY benefit by LYING?\" \n\nOn a side note, I think this question last came up in the thread where Dan-lien-your-name Wilson got his title bestowed upon him.\n\nWhat are the chances that the \"benefits\" are the same for their lies?\n\nI think that it is a rather feeble attempt to pull those who are sick and tired of dwelling in their own ignorance and trying to better themselves, back into the pool of lies and deceit by sowing doubt where there should be none.\n\nOne of the most important Scottism's - TRUST BUT VERIFY..... (For those just tuning in, go check that whole Scottism's thread) <----- See what I did there ?\n\nHow is it possible not to see comments like theirs for anything but the shit that it is if you've done ANY of the legwork that Scott asks of us?\n\nThe first conversation I ever had with Scott Duncan, I misused a word that I thought I knew. He called me on it and waited on me to actually look it up before resuming the conversation. Seriously! \nI have NEVER EVER EVER had another man take that kind of patience with me before.\n\nScott won't tolerate bullshit period, and any serious look at the Tender for Law group will demonstrate that he has taught US not to tolerate it anymore either. This is most certainly a bit of a \"battle\" for me as I have been born into a sea of it. The habit of actually looking stuff up for myself, checking the facts, and getting things straight before communicating it onto someone else is actually a life altering experience in and of itself.",
