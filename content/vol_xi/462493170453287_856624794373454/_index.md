   "message": "So, from the Lien the Name dept.\n\nScott\n\nWhen the lien is registered, is it fair to say that since the secured party is 9111-1111 Quebec Inc IN TRUST, and all property becomes properties of FTP TRUST held by the new TRUSTEE which is 9111-1111 Quebec Inc, it then bocomes a FACT in law that FTP TRUST has been expressed ?\n\nIn other words, this piece of paper, (lien) is PROOF that FTP TRUST has been established, and that no more proofs is necessary in regards of its existence ?\n\nShit, do you get what I am asking ? :/",
