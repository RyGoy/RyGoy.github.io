   "message": "\"A land patent is an exclusive land grant made by a sovereign entity with respect to a particular tract of land. To make such a grant �patent�, a sovereign (proprietary landowner) must document the land grant, securely sign and seal the document (patent), and openly publish the documents for the public to see. An official land patent is the highest evidence of right, title, and interest to a defined area. It is usually granted by a central, federal, or state government to an individual or to a private company. \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_patent",
