   "message": "Boy did you ever Rick!  Historically Harley riders are an interesting group.  Those we knew were *forever* disassembling & reassembling their motorcycles, frequently in the living room or bedroom of their homes.  In my experience the Japanese motorcycles have been easier and cheaper to maintain, and somewhat more reliable.  When you think about it, it's funny that there is a hierarchy in the motorcycle world - scooters = men with \"vaginas\", Japanese bikes = weekend warriors, Harley Davidson motorcycles = suspiciously cool.",
