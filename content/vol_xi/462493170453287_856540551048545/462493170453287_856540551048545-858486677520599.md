   "message": "Well let's think about that Maximus.  The average price of a Ducati is 10,000 - 15,000 CA.  The average price of a scooter is 2,000 - 4,000 CA.  Both get you from point A to point B.  The scooter is demonstrably less expensive for gas and repairs (should you not do this yourself).  So it could be asserted that practical men who care more about function than dick-length perception ride scooters.  The real question is, \"Are you confident and manly enough to ride a scooter?\"  Apparently there are many obese, hairy men who fall into this category :D",
