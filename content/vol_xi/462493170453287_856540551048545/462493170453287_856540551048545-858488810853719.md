   "message": "I ride a Honda 125cc Scooter around shit traffic. It does 70mph easily and I love it but I think I mentioned before I miss bigger bikes. I rode the Scooter 130 miles through snow in February with a huge pack on my back on the Freeway. I must have looked like a nutter. I rode it at the max (70 mph happens to be the max here) purely to take my mind off what I was doing. I had early hypothermia when I got off without even one stop and was walking like John Wayne :-) Does that answer your question ?",
