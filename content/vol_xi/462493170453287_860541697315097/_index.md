   "message": "Just went to have a certified copy of my PERSON's Birth CERTIFICAT at a Notary but was very surprised at the price for ONE!!! :O\n25$ = 1 certified copy\n\nSo the receptionist told me that I could check with another notary across the street... so I did...\n\nTurns out they don't give the services if you are not a client with them.\nBut if you are, the service is free! :O\n\nSo I went back to the first notary and told the receptionist that I had a will made with them, under the same name, a few years ago and so would they offer the same service as there competitor?\n\nShe said \"no!\". That's the price! :O\n\nSo I asked if I had more documents made, would she reduce the price?\n\nShe called the notary and came back with an incredible price of\n\n50$ = 5 certified copy! :O\n\nFuck! \n\nHow much did some of you pay? From what I read, 1$ or 2$/copy, right?",
