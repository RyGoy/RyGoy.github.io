   "message": "So, I went to the bank to see if I could get a certified copy of the birth certificate from them, and they did in deed gave me the two copies I asked, no charge. Yeah! :D\n\nIn French it's called \"Copie conforme\".\n\nNow I stopped at the notary with that certified copy and asked if this was good enough to send to the bank of Canada or if notarising it would be better.\n\nSo the receptionist called the notary and she was told that if it's from a bank to a bank that it was OK if it was certified by the bank's manager, which it was.\n\nAfter asking the receptionist a few questions I saw that she was confused about the difference between the different ways to certify a true copy of a document. But it came down to what was written in Wikipedia's link I posted yesterday, that, it depends on what the other party is asking.",
