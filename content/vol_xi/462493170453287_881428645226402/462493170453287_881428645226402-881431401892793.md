   "message": "This part of history is almost done. The name Scott Duncan will be relevant to nobody but the few here. It serves as an historic record, and you will be able to point here and say, we knew back then.\n\nI did the exponential curve calculation, and 2013 in January was when this group started. It was time. \n\nAt least here, I can say, I told the truth, and nobody listened.\n\nIn 2016, I collect all the debts, and I intend to burn the credulous. If people VALUE \"belief\" they value evil; I accept that.\n\nI claim the right to exploit it as I would, any other natural resource.",
