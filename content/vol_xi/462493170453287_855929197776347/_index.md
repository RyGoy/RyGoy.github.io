   "message": "\"This is police state stuff.\n\nTwo men were shot and killed, in public, in February. Police know who did it, but they will not tell us. They say no charges should be laid in the case, but they will not tell us why, or give us the information they uncovered in their investigation. Police have security-camera video of the incident, but they will not show it to us.\n\nTwo people are dead, and the Toronto Police Serviceï¿½s response, after four months of investigation, boils down to: Nothing to see here. Trust us. Move along.\"\n\nSee...the colour of one's skin has nothing to do with it. Once you put on that uniform your ARE by default a lying-sack-of-shit. The new police chief seems to wear this \"suit\" well :P",
