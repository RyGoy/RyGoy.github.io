   "message": "Anibal - your gift was met with much rejoicing!  They are awesome mugs and we use them often.  Apologies for not getting this information to you sooner.  We meant to take \"mug shots\" to celebrate; but things kept breaking here.  We tore everything apart yesterday - living space, network, et. al. - and have finally succeeded in sending belated thanks.  So...THANKS!",
