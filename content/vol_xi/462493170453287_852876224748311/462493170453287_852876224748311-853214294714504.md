   "message": "Virtually every day in large metropolitan areas you can look out the window and see a parade passing by.  Some draw moderate attention - the nude bicyclists (I'm still not sure how they managed to pull that off) - but most pass relatively unnoticed.  Last weekend the mother of all protest marches went by, blocking main streets and thoroughfares for what seemed like an eternity.  \n\nI watched as people passed by with signs for \"native rights\", anti-GMO, water conservation, anti-frakking, anti-abortion, gay marriage rights; trying to make sense of whether there was a general theme.   It was prohibitively hot and there seemed to be no consensus among the \"protesters\" as to any general theme.  I congratulate everyone for showing up, but with the possible exception of sun stroke, I'm at a loss as to what they may have accomplished.\n\nIt reminded me a lot of a scene from Terry Gilliam's 1985 Movie, Brazil.",
