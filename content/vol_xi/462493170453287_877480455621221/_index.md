   "message": "Let's all take a moment, and appreciate the gift the great, humble, and mysterious SATOSHI NAKAMOTO has given us, and the great contribution to humanity HE/SHE/THEY have given us.\n\n...but this is just the first piece. Wait until you see what's coming.\n\nThese have been a wild 5 years, and we are building things we'd never even thought possible 5 years ago.\n\nFUN FACT: BOTH Menard and Clifford sat in a GENESIS BLOCK mine and not only didn't SEE THE HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE, but ACTIVELY DISMISSED IT.\n\nI will ALWAYS be here, YEAR AFTER YEAR to remind them of their ignorance of EVERYTHING.\n\nTHEY aren't going to provide the answer, WE ARE! FREE! NO COST, AND NO BEGGING, BECAUSE WE CAN MAKE MONEY! LITERALLY!\n\n...feel the burn, boys! :D\n\nLet us all bow to Emperor Satoshi, and gaze upon the world's FIRST blockchain application! :D <3\n\nBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System",
