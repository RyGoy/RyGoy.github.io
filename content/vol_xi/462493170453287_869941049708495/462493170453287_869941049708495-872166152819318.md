   "message": "I do that too. The trick that I use for keeping track of it all, is to open each offshoot of my main search in a new tab. That way you can backtrack from right to left, tab by tab, closing them as you go. \n\nI also keep the relevant tabs open to refer back to as needed. I currently have the OAuth tutorial open in one:\nhttps://knpuniversity.com/screencast/oauth/client-credentials#play \n\nThe Coop API page in another: \nhttp://coop.apps.knpuniversity.com/login\n\nThe OAuth Github repository:\nhttps://github.com/knpuniversity/oauth\n\nThe documentation on Guzzle:\nhttp://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/\n\nThe documentation on Symfony:\nhttp://symfony.com/what-is-symfony\n\nAnd the PHP online manual:\nhttps://secure.php.net/manual/en/",
