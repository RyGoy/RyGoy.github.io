   "message": "People may or may not remember my court appearance last December over a speeding fine. I argued with the man in the robe and eventually left the court after responding to being called \"YOU\" a few times...\n\nThe court then issued a fine for x amount. I ignored their letters until a collection company then started issuing letters. I replied to them with a notice of mistake. They replied with a stock response so I sent another letter outlining my questions again and telling them I simply wanted some clarification regarding the matter. \n\nI also added that if they didn't respond within 5 days legal accord & satisfaction would be established.\n\nThey didn't respond so I sent a final notice notifying them that legal accord and satisfaction had been established and that the matter was considered closed.\n\nToday a warrant was received issued by the court for the amount.\n\nHave I no choice but to pay this to avoid prison (probably in the front door and out the back) or is the fact that I asked questions and received no response grounds for me to object to the warrant?",
