   "message": "But you did sign the drivers license, and you did commit the \"offense.\" :/ Then you went to court, and answered to \"YOU.\" Then ignored all letters from the court, then it went in to collections. You sent a bill of exchange, but did not follow thru. Now they are about to issue an arrest warrant if someone does not settle the accounting.\n\nPete Daoust is correct that you must demand the money you sent them, if they refused it. If you have send payment, they either can accept it, or refuse it. And you must always say you want to pay. Pete is correct.\n\nMy concern goes more with the corruption of the courts, and the fact they are not following their own laws. The \"truth\" does not matter in those places. \n\nWhat if while you are asking for the bill of exchange (however long it takes) an arrest warrant is issued, and you get kidnapped? You will still be \"right,\" but with a record, and in jail. How will that impact your life? Worth 250�? \n\nNow, maybe you may conditionally send payment and settle the bill, conditioned that, if the money sent was refused it must be sent back. If  they do not sent back the bill of exchange in certain amount of time, then you will bill them for the 250�. That way you avoid possible jail time, while still reserving the right to collect for a fraudulent debt paid.\n\nIf I am wrong, please someone come tell me. I am just astound at the amount of stress, and danger some folks will go for petty things, like traffic tickets. It hurts to see folks go to jail for 250�, that haven't even committed a real crime. :/",
