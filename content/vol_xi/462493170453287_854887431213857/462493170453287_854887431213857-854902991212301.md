   "message": "Ok Eamonn, let's assume Pete is \"legally\" correct, and that perhaps you may deal with it in other ways other than \"paying.\" In the meantime the \"legal\" bureaucracy issues an arrest warrant for EAMONN O BRIEN, which has already APPEARED, and IDENTIFIED as such in the public record. Are you willing to risk a kidnapping/arrest while the \"legal\" benevolent bureaucracy honors your bill of exchange? \n\nI am just curious onto why folks can go over such extreme risk, just for a traffic ticket.  :/",
