   "message": "It's definitively NOT about being docile. If your life depends on it, fight for your life! Break a leg! But this is a traffic ticket, and you started doing this \"process\" being not sure about it, and things are happening, and you still are not sure why. Is knowing when to pick your battles.\n\nOf course you must ask for that money back, if it was refused. Of course you must not cease asking questions. But I have learned to pick my battles, and it has served me well. \n\nI have something very clear, I am NOT Scott Duncan. This is a slavery plantation, and I want to live as much as possible. I can't be acting like a freedumber, speeding, and then fighting for my life for a traffic ticket.",
