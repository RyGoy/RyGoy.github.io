   "message": "<<Do you know why this phrase is so sad, \"I chose to have faith\"? Because it represents giving up. It represents an intelligent man trading in uncertainty and honesty and curiosity for faith and sureness and happiness.\n\nIt represents a man who never found answers, and so he wove them from the stories we tell about Christianity and our morals as a society. He wore them like a cassock...\n\nHe is a good man.\nAnd he is terrifying. He is proof that you can wear surety and happiness like a cassock.\nYou just have to close your eyes.>>",
