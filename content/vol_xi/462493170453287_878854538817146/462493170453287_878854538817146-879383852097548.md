   "message": "It's not the first time in history that knowing can get you hurt and/or killed. But that's not enough for me. It fucking scares me in a weird way. Precisely because they can improvise. I love that at least my knowledge can protect me... sorta and thats if i continue learning to implement action taking. It does not protect my teeth from being arbitrarily kicked in but it's a start. With all this side of the Web previously unknown to me I know I'm not alone thinking my way so... it's a great journey so far and it should be a fun ride as we go forward. It's a pleasure to share it with plenty of humans like you.",
