   "message": "Because of the seriousness of the issue. Not because it's less true but I think for me it relates to what the Admiral is talking about. The amount of idiots out there who are benefiting form the system in place is High! For a while before, reasoning is remotely possible  \"you are crazy\" first in front of the world, with or without proof. \n\nTalking about all these demonstrable facts and the lack of trustworthiness the system also demonstrable, as built over time is still supported by a breed of good people who didn't have the chance to value the right things and think the right way, some of these people a great \"thinker\" in lesser important spheres and workers with great value and productivity. \n\nWhen I talk to my family, which I consider in some way attach to their bullshit, they are also really good at being independant. None the less, the asset portfolio is mostly fiat and lands, they still believe the show can go on forever.... they don't think a war is coming. They think I'm crazy to think so. There moto remains that your highest chance at indï¿½pendance is to have the wealth to be and to do so...\n\nNow being super open and public about it would result in a lot of issues for me, potentially getting fired cause I am on payroll. Also, it his all hidden in plain sight but none the less complicated material to come to the simple axiom and principles we were pointed to...\n\nYou are going against an old system that will fight and try to discredit you... I m scared of that. Like Scott said once, I love my bullshit so very much and I'm a little to emotional when comes to the possibility of having my life turned to shambles cause of a media smear or other fallacious tactics...\n\n But hey, you could be that guy that against all odds really did exposed the elephant in the room (at least)...",
