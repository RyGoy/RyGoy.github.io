   "message": "I just KNOW there's some Piece-of-Shit Christian, or some mutant gender-questionable femi-nazi out there that will say I'm endorsing a \"killer\". ...to which I say: \"Eat a dick\".\n\nThe issue is him SIGNING something, and the notion of NOT doing so being a \"red flag\". You're \"bad\" for not signing? The Law Society HAD to respond (Through his lawyer), and his answer that SIGNING is \"merely an acknowledgement that he'd read the order\" is simply untrue.\n\nOK! Let's use our LEGAL knowledge and SPOT THE LIES!",
