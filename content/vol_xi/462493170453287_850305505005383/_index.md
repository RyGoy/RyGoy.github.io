   "message": "The Scott-isms on one page, thread. \n\nI want to get all my \"Scott-isms\" here in one place for an article, examining each one in detail.\n\nIt's time to go ABOVE \"Legal/Law\" and look at the immutable mechanics that YOU can control. Like thought itself, these things cannot be controlled by \"Law/Legal\", or any other organization. They are controlled by TRUTH, and UNDERSTANDING.\n\nTHESE are the rules that you do not get to \"Pick-and-Choose\". These are true. It doesn't matter what you think/feel/believe. If it conflicts with a \"Scott-ism\", it is wrong. Call that my \"arrogance\" at your own peril.\n\nI'll start with:\n\nTHE MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG: There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule. NONE. If you find yourself agreeing with the \"majority\", it's time to stop and think, \"am I running a program\"?\n\nI intend to expand on every one you post. Yes, I'm writing all of you a fucking BIBLE, with NO talking snakes, NO \"Angels\", and (best of all) NO PIECE-OF-SHIT-JESUS!*\n\nFollowed by:\n\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A \"GOOD\" LAWYER: There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule. The LAW SOCIETY LITERALLY claims OWNERSHIP of you (INDIVIDUALS), and there is NO scenario where anyone \"good\" could look at themselves in the mirror, if they claim to \"own\" you. If I claimed to \"own\" you, your reaction would NOT be \"Well, I don't agree with that, but basically you are good\"! You just wouldn't. If you think you would, you shouldn't be reading this group, you should be scrubbing my deck!\n\nAnyway, SCOTT-isms! GO!\n\n*Note that this does not exclude \"BETTER-THAN-JESUS\".",
