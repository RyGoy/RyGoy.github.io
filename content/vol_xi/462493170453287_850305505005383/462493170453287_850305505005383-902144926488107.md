   "message": "The next wave of people who will build EVERYTHING are here now. Just as YOU have learned off of me, so have many others, in computer science, accounting, law, biochemistry, robotics, and AI.\n\nSome of you are smart, but not very creative, and some of you are creative, but stupid as posts. I intend to match and merge the two. I remove compartmentalization at the end of the year.\n\nIF I've done everything right, there will be a 3-year burn of innovation like the world has never seen. All this will seem quite quaint, one day.\n\nHalf of a lifetimes work went into this. I will take what I need, and give the rest to everyone. Wars aren't cheap and it costs money to kill people, so I'm going to need a lot of it. \n\nI'm going to show everyone how to do it themselves! 2016 I am going to haul in the cash! Ring the register, as it were! Lets make a global run on banks!",
