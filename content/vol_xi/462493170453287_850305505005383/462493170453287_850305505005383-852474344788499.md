   "message": "I cannot stress how important \"Rule # 4\" is. I simply can't.\n\nDo whatever it takes to MAKE SURE they don't take you seriously while you build. ESPECIALLY if it regards technology. Government workers are STUPID and they don't KNOW they are stupid. This has benefits and drawbacks.\n\n\"He's crazy\" is something they can fit into their heads.\n\n\"Some guy with mysterious technology\" doesn't and they will just send armed thugs to eliminate it.\n\nI've leveraged the \"crazy\" card since I dropped my first body :D\n\n...so I know what I'm talking about.\n\nIf they want to slap the \"crazy\" card on you...LET THEM. Just make sure you have agency arranged ahead of time.",
