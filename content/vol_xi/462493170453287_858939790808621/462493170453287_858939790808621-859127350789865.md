Fucking insane Bullshit...\nWhy? \nLanguage, I think, is the key, Whether it is a legal language or programming Language  Most,  vessels, who are born here, cannot, after being taught English as a first language, It seems cannot think for them selves, With out a guide book. Things that are issued like Warrants, Legal documents, often have Latin titles,  \nLatin is/was the language of Rome - The Fucking Roman empire.\n Crazy as  a shit house rat, right?\n One learns:  one can deem certain persons as: named corporation\na non person  =  persona non grata: et al.\nIs this bulshit?
