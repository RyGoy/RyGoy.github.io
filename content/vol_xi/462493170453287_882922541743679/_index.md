I smell SOCIAL ENGINEERING language here BIG TIME!!\n\nAccording to \"OUR GOVERNMENT\", there are three classes of \"CANADIANS\".  The HARPER GOVERNMENT defines us into three categories:\n\n1) \"NEW CANADIANS\" (Those they feel confident \"THEY\" can brainwash into their agenda.)\n\n2) \"EXISTING CANADIANS\" (I can only PRESUME this means CANADIANS that are older than the youth - those that have some memory of rights and therefor are an EXISTING problem - not dead yet.)\n\n3)  \"OLD STOCK CANADIANS \" (us older CANADIANS that need to die or be dealt with because we remember something about having rights.)\n\nComments?",
