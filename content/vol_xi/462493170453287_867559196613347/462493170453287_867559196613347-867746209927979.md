   "message": "Is it possible that when one has a lien of $5 millions on a cop shop, and the municipality, that the cops decides to NOT engage with this PERSON anymore ?\n\nI am asking because it happened twice with Denis, one for a stop signe he burnt, and one for being caught talking on his cell while driving.\n\nBoth times the cops turned on their lights and start the chase, and after a few seconds they just turned off these lights and stop the chase and went away.....\n\nIs it a coincidence, or in fact, they just don't want to engage with him ?",
