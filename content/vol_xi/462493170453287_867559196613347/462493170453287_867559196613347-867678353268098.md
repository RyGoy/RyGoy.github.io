Now the Piece-of-Shit Christian kicker:\n\nMar in ARAMAIC (You know! That language Piece-of-Shit Jesus would have spoken if he's actually existed!) refers to BISHOPS of the church before they were called Bishops.\n\nPiece-of-Shit Christians try to cram as much truth as they can, in... then they use YOUR ignorance to spin lies.\n\nMAR=HARM. Period.\n\nI means Piece-of-Shit Christians HARM... so I ALWAYS pay attention to GRAMMAR. :D\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ntzTuZHH3IE?list=PL2DD8A219BDE44542",
