You have called it perfectly. You have ACTUALLY learned. A rarity here. \n\n\"Give me money and I'll show you magic 'good' law with magic 'good' courts\"... REALLY?\n\nWell I just give money. I win. Game Over.\n\nYou can create your own bank, RIGHT NOW. I win. Game Over.\n\nI HAVE NEVER CHARGED MONEY FOR ANY OF IT, AND I NEVER WILL. \n\nI WIN. \n\nGAME OVER.\n\nWhy would ANYONE fall for Clifford or Menard's Crap?",
