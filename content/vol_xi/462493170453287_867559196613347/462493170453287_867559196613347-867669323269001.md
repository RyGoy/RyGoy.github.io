   "message": "That seems to be the freedumb time line.  Lie thru omission make some quick cash.  Have a few arguments with Scott and look like a complete asshat.  Make some lie thru omission videos defending retarded position.  Completely deny any wrongdoing and deny Agency exists as well as some lame argument to this effect:  You can not make contract through \"this not is legal tender\".  Start a private pyramid scheme away from criticism and start really laying on the lies.   How can you accept the benefit of legal tender without the obligations even if you did not get what you paid for?!?!?!?  It means you are operating in breach of trust also and in bad faith.",
