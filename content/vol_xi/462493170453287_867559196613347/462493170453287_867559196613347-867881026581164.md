   "message": "The Fender was seeking answers. I was but a stop, but he loves a piece of bullshit too much, and he's running from the reality, that the bullshit he loves will cost him everything of TRUE value.\n\nKarl Lentz was just another stop. Alas, that debt bled over into a time when the Fender was on one of my vessels, so there remains a debt.\n\nAll I can say about The Fender is that he is stuck on his current path, and should be left alone.",
