   "message": "That doesn't actually solve the problem staring you in the face.\n\nI have been very clear about what you are up against, but it's only REAL to those who actually experience it.\n\nQuebecois have to TRANSLATE (not \"interpret\") what I say, so the words I choose become VERY clear, as everyone in Quebec who reads what I say, will tell you. It's a HUGE leg-up! An advantage only they have!\n\nSadly, it's easier to teach the people who think in French than it is to teach people who speak ENGLISH.",
