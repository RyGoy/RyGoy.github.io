   "message": "I saw the video. I find very difficult to have empathy with this woman, and her husband. I have empathy for their children, for they just do/go where ever \"mom and dad\" say to go. Plus she had her moment here, and blew it.\n\nAm I the only one to see she, and her husband brought all this upon themselves? Did Dean put a gun to their heads for them to do anything? Assuming \"her side of the story\" is true (which I do not know), Dean lied, but, she seems to be playing the \"It's ALL Dean Clifford's fault!\" card. I do not buy it. Maybe the video should had been her admitting how \"belief\" almost ruined their lives, and how she and her husband's actions possibly harmed their family.\n\nOne HUGE thing about the old programming is this thing of NOT wanting to assume responsibility for our actions. Like with \"Jesus the Mega-Insurer\", someone else needs to be blamed, and take the hit for the INSURED party. \n\nAs an ex-Free-Dummer I can \"feel\" some empathy for them. After all I come from that, and it was Scott who gave me the tools and data for a new program. The rest I had to do myself, putting the pieces together. But if you came to the Tender for Law and had the opportunity to be exposed to what Admiral Scott has been teaching, and you dismiss it, it's hard for me to have empathy.",
