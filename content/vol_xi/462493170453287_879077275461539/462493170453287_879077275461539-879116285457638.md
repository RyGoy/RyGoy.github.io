   "message": "The stupid cunt followed me for a grand total of 3 weeks.\n\nAndrew D'Aragon showed up around that time. Two separate and independent parties... as objective as Free-Dumbers CAN be (Yes you were all Free-Dumbers back then) and the Admiral of a private navy had to set you both straight.\n\nKookie-Lee rejected what I had to say, because I had mean things to say about her bullshit. She gets bilked for Ca$h.\n\nAnyone ever notice how I'm never accused of scamming anyone? \n\nSeriously; Where are MY \"victims\"? Where are all the \"Expose the Admiral\" videos?\n\nIt doesn't matter if you get butthurt because of the #1 rule of the universe... I'M STILL RIGHT!\n\nFUCKING QED!",
