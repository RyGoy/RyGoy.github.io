   "message": "JANICK PAQUETTE received a letter from REVENU QUï¿½BEC saying that they had received the MR-69 form. However, they could not accept it because the form signatory is not authorised to sign this request for a proxy.\n\nSo I checked the form I signed, that they sent back for correction, and the qualified signature is there, the beginning of the paragraph is:\n\n\"I, JANICK PAQUETTE, am naming as a designated person or a business ...\"\n\nThe only thing I forgot is to put \"By:\" before the signature. :/\n\nSo why are thry writing that the signatory is not authorised to sign this request? :/",
