   "message": "OH FFS!\n\nWell Dean C. Clifford will be happy his old buddies are back in vogue! :D\n\nWhat? You didn't know about Dean C. Clifford's \"Stormfront\" connections? Well the Internet NEVER forgets, and Dean has plenty of victims who will happily point you to what you need.\n\nSee, that's how you know a government and/or Law Society Shill is around. i have no \"victims\" so the only people who have anything bad to say about ME, are butt-hurt whiners, and Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson (Who is now known by that name, and as such, now remains silent, now that the little bitch knows his place). I have no \"victims\". I don't beg for money, and I don't bleed the resources of the people who ask for my time. The only people with anything to say against me, are the Butt-hurt, and Law Society/Government Shills/Agents. None of which make me ANY less right. They can call me names, but I still keep pointing to the truth, and people are starting to see. There is NOTHING anyone can do to stop it. This means even the Law Society/Government stooges are butthurt too. That's what EVERYONE who has ANYTHING bad to say about me has on me; \"I'm butthurt\" is all their argument boils down to: \"Butthurt\".\n\nDean C. Clifford, and Robert-Arthur: Menard, on the other hand, have HUNDREDS. Free-Dumbers, and the NSA created \"Sovereign Citizens,\" seem to attract Neo Nazis. they still believe in RACE, despite the fact that we've mapped the human genome, and found that \"race\" is just shit we made up...\n\n...which means that behind it all, you will find a Piece-of-Shit Christian. ONLY Piece-of-Shit Christians are dumb enough to adopt this value system.",
