   "message": "Steve Krupnik never sought to HARM me. He just lied to his (Favourite) kid in front of me. In my home.\n\nSteve WISHES he would wake up with a vicious Girl-Pirate standing over his bed with a blade! He really does...\n\n...then he'd avoid the inevitable wrath of his favourite child. Oh he can hold it off for a few years with \"later\" and the odd Lawyer Lie, but that day is coming. \"Death by Pirate\" is a gift I will not grant. Mister Krupnik has far worse than I could ever do, coming.\n\n...from his own child. He'd do anything to avoid the look of contempt and betrayal coming from that child.\n\nSteve Krupnik has a fate FAR worse than any bullet or blade could deliver.",
