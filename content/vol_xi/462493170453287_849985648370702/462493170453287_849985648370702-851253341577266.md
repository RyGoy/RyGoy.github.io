   "message": "NORMALLY the fate of lawyers who have made war on AQUILAE suffer the fate of:\n\nBlinding.\n\nRemoval of thumbs.\n\nThis is a death sentence to them. They become a IMMEDIATE burden to their family. Lawyers have no \"retirement plans\" or Pensions\" or even Employment Insurance. They can't even get welfare! (Members of the BAR cannot collect welfare!) They have no ACTUAL skill/value, and they spiral down to their own demise, in misery and fear. \n\nIt a VERY entertaining thing to watch! :D\n\nUm... so I've heard. :/",
