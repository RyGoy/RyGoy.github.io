   "message": "So, now that she is an adult. Who's responsibility it is to find out before \"applying,\", hers, or her \"parents\"?\n\nI have mixed feelings about some things here. You have some parents that did not sold their offspring to the government/masters, did not let the government's education tamper her, and willingly or not, have given her the chance to choose for herself if she wants to be a slave, or really be free, like the rest of all sane animals on earth. If she somehow gets \"citizenship\" now, it's HER decision. \n\nI wasn't given that chance, nor most of us. It's evidently easier said than done, but the fact remains I debate whether they did her a favor, or placed her in a very lonely, and difficult position in this \"modern\" world.\n\nWhat do you all think?",
