   "message": "Why would they have to teach her about surety, and accounting if she was not \"registered\" Crown property?\n\nSince she is now legally of age, they cannot \"register\" her now, for they must explain the terms of conditions of slavery. It's better to \"let one go.\" But it shows how strong the cult to worshiping papers is embedded in this system.\n\nWhen I saw her video, I thought today someone like her with basic training, using/access to the internet and the blockchain applications, she can have an education, a \"job,\" MONEY, and with the right kind of friends, she may even travel beyond the seas.",
