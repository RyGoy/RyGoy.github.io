   "message": "I have been forthright about thinking wrong, I have been putting my laundry out for everyone to see, so all can benefit from teachings that comes from this, \n    I am one of the few that either has the balls or stupidity to do this.  i was looking to fight the rapers of children, cleverly disguised as agents of an imaginary friend. I sought the end to this.\n     I found those who capitalize on ignorance and feed off of victim hood disguised as agents of the law. and those who are in the culture of victim hood, \n\n   I have sought release from the debt prison and the Cult of Canada, The Cult of the Romans ( so they say, it seems to be much older, ( they = those that teach bull shit) based on a one book. I was one of the few who put it ou there.( It= thinking) \n\n I now get the importance of questioning everything.  \n\nI wish to thank all who have been my friends, Who now are no longer are my friends, who have un-friended me,\n\n good...\n\n  You saved my ass in the dark times. Forcing me to think\n\nIts not my surety, You account for it.  \n\nI am heading to Darian Gap with my rescue shotgun.on a fucking boat.\n\nWhat kind of ship would you like?\nI like the name of this one...  but feelings and thinking...\n\nLearned helplessness and the suspension of reason are your enemies, not me.\n\nhttp://www.motorsailer.org/yacht/65-ft-1985-schooner-on-off/",
