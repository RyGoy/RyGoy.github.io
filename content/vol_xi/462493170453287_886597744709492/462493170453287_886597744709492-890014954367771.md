   "message": "Lets work harder. ;) \nNow that we know how to create our own currencies and our bank. \nThat we know the very basics of legalese and court procedures, how to pepare and how to submit document as an actual Administrator, we know that we are playing in a fictitious realm where paper worth more then and club house rules do not apply to us... because they claim ownership upon us. What would be the next logical step... I think \"doing it\" is the thing that comes to mind. Being in action would most certainly generate more relevant question.\n\nFor me...  how do you avoid joinder with Alternative currencies if you don't yet have value to earn them out of the Fiat system?",
