   "message": "You will live in a world where honesty has VALUE, and money is controlled by YOU. Trustworthy single moms will be BANKERS, and homeless will get paid for VALUE they collect on devices that PAY THEM and act as their wallets. These devices will be controlled by THEM and can collect everything from climate info to Police presence... and they will be able to buy their next meal just by existing, and being honest.\n\nNEW wealth can NEVER be controlled and TRULY belongs to EVERYONE. This means that those who make the mistakes, pay, and those who do right, are rewarded.\n\nThis will happen IN MY LIFETIME...\n\n...even if it kills me. It probably will.",
