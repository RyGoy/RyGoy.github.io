   "message": "You were but one raindrop in a FLOOD. It's the FLOOD that causes the damage. As soon as you CHOOSE the flood, you are responsible. Piece-of-Shit Christians are a flood unto themselves, yet you KNOW they are ALL reading here, because they KNOW, in REALITY, that nothing they believe about their imaginary sky-daddy, and Zombie-Rape-Baby Jesus is true. Except Piece-of-Shit Christians are all about lying to each other, so they have to quietly read the \"Devil\" truth from the \"Evil Baby-Eating Atheist\", and not tell anyone, so they can keep the flood destroying.\n\nThey CHOSE ignorance, and are worthy of NOTHING but ridicule and contempt.\n\nNotice the Free-Dumbers are the same, and get treated the same.\n\nAt the moment, that is the ONLY way the truth is spread from here, except when you PUT PEN TO PAPER, and QUESTION THEM.\n\nAnd NEVER accept \"Final correspondence:\" declarations. They simply do not have the right to do that. They are GOVERNMENT. The rules are VERY clear.",
