   "message": "I know we have been taught to deflect surety at all times. I hesitated asking, but, curiosity got the best of me. :/\n\n******\n\nMy question arose from re-listening to Sino General and his interviews with Winston Shrout.\n\nAs you likely know, Winston teaches to always deflect surety as well. However, as you may also know, he occasionally mentions, that he has learned enough about law that quite often he is eager to accept and be surety, explaining only that there is a very good reason why people start insurance companies which go out of their way to be surety - it's the most powerful legal position to have. \n\n******\n\nHearing that Winston himself likes to be surety caused cognitive dissonance as it goes against everything I/we have learned (and what Winston teaches as well).\n\nMy hope was that Scott might shed some light on why Winston (and insurance companies) see a tremendous advantage to accepting surety for as much as they can, rather than deflecting it.\n\nMy thought was that whatever Winston was referring to might fit in well with the topic of underwriting that has surfaced here recently. :(",
