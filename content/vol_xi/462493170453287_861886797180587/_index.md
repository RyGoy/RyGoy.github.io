   "message": "O.K.    For what seems like obvious reasons, now you guys have me thinking about UNDERWRITERS and UNDERTAKERS of ESTATES who SEIZE SURETY for their BENEFIT, rather than deflect it, and use it to their advantage to INSURE themselves (not to mention all of that in a blockchain) and UNDERWRITE their endeavors.\n\nFast frward to...\n\n\"I accept your OATH\" (here i see SURETY and ACCOUNTING and UNDERWRITERS): is something I want to know more about. Is this notion merely FREEDUMB postulations? \n\n^^ Article request about seizing and accepting all surety in all matters. \nI know this may seem UBER odd, but, I think my EDUCATED inkling about the advantages of seizing/claiming ownership of SURETY might bear fruit :)\n\nPlease and thank Scott. <--- Notice how I didn't sat YOU?",
