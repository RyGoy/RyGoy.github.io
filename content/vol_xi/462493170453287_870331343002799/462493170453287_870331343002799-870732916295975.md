   "message": "Justice: YOU have reserved YOUR rights, Ma'am and YOUR rights will be protected in this courtroom but YOU are going to have to take a seat.  This is a court of law.  \n\nTowards the end of trial,\nMe:  Let the record show that Mr. Supernumerary and the Crown have violated my rights.   I reserved all rights.  Ye have no standing for speaking.  Crown, are YOU surety in this matter?  I assume Crown is surety in this matter as we are proceeding as I have negated  any understanding in this matter, nor consent.\n\nThe Justice said the Crown was not a surety and refused to identify surety.",
