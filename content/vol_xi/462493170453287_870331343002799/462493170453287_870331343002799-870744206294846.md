   "message": "The party making the claim is the party with surety.  \n\nIt is a sentence. It has the qualifications of being a sentence.   It starts with a capital letter, even has a comma, and a period.    It probably doesn't look very coherent, as I was trying to spit it out in frustration and fear but I knew what I wanted to say.  I think the 'as' was meant to be an 'and' and  I know the 'nor' should have been 'and/or\".   I'll have to review the recording.",
