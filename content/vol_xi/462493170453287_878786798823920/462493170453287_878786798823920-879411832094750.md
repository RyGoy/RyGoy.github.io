   "message": "THAT is beyond the ability of most readers.\n\nThat's why the question is SO important. I HAVE no VALUE; I GIVE value. Knowledge is NOT value, until you need it. Ask Janick Paquette if algebra or calculus applied in her life at all, and she will say \"No\". That SAME knowledge I was using before I even knew what they were even CALLED. I use algebra at least 12 times a day. Computers speak in math.\n\nI simply relate knowledge that you miss because you would prefer to believe the lies you were told by people you trust. Otherwise you would have to accept that the people you trusted were ignorant and/or evil.",
