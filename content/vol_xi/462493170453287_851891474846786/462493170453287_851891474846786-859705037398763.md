   "message": "^ This is a view favored by scientists to indicate a well-researched theory that invites comment and peer review as a stepping-stone to becoming established fact.  \n\nWhen the general public refers to being entitled to your \"opinion\" they are delivering a back-handed insult.  It frequently relates to their unsubstantiated belief that their position is correct.  As they are unwilling, or unable, to demonstrate the facts, they dismiss your position as mere rhetoric thereby ending any challenge or debate.",
