   "message": "I was revisiting a thread from 3 years ago. The first time I helped a friend with the \"Notice of Mistake\" and \"worked,\" (Michael A Rivera) I wrote in a thread thanking Scott, but I also thanked \"Jesus\"  \"My King.\" I feel fortunate I do not suffer from such mental illness any longer, yet I feel repulsed, and embarrassed to read something like that now. It was ONLY Admiral Scott that gave me the knowledge about surety, and accounting, and the Notice of Mistake, yet I was thanking as well an imaginary evil friend that did absolutely nothing. \n\nI will never be able to repay the Admiral JUST for THAT one thing. Bringing some sanity into my life.",
