   "message": "Yes.  WebCapades v. Duncan - good times.  If memory serves they were eventually wiped off the face of the earth.  This was my first, but not last, experience with people who decided to engage Scott in nuisance suits (or slap suits) to get him to shut up or withdraw from an initiative.  As you can imagine he latches on to these things and hangs on like a bulldog until they are literally begging him to stop.  As an added bonus we have discovered that when the going gets tough they eventually target \"the girl\".  Historically this has been a mistake...but hey...you can't blame them for trying :D",
