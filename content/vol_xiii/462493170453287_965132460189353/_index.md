   "message": "One of my ADORABLE daughter (she really is :D ), got EXPULSED from school yesterday :-o\n\nNow, to return to school, she has to do a written REFLEXION on what is �COLLABORATION�\n\nFuck, it�s almost like they ASK for it :/\n\nI might be busy for the next 48 hours, because I think thi is one heck of a GREAT opportunity for my daughter to learn what COLLABORATION is�..so if you don�t see me much in here, that�s the REASON.\n\np.s. I can�t wait for them to COLLABORATE with me by faxing me their financial statements so I can pin point to my daughter how much DEBTS gets created so she can have an education here in Quebec. And I hope I won�t find ANY corruption in these financial statements :/",
