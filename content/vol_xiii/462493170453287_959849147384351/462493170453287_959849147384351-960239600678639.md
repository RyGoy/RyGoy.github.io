   "message": "I used to be a believer in a lot of things...now I realize to believe something is to stop looking at other possibilities...I no longer profess to believe in anything...I may \"think\" something is true, but I have an open mind that I may find out it's not true and adjust my thinking. I am a seeker of knowledge, which drew me to this group. So yes, Pete Daoust, I am working on getting out of the wooduckery...step by step, figuring it out...in the process I've lost my first marriage, my family, a cush 6 figure job, etc., but going along with the status quo and the societal conditioning was just unacceptable to me...",
