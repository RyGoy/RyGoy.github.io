   "message": "Just had a read to see what the fuss was about.\n\nI do that whenever I think \"Scott was a little harsh with that guy\". I'm speaking of Chris Evan here. \n\nThis is why I go look. It always turns out to be reserved responses when I find the reason. I think I did. There is a huge problem of people lying about what Scott Duncan says.\n\nIntentional or not, there comes a point where the end results are the same. People are lying about Scott Duncan, and nobody seems to care.\n\nI feel bad for Chris. I feel worse for Scott Duncan.",
