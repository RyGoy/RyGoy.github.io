   "message": "From the \"It's all surety and accounting\" Department. \n\nI got a Water Bill in the mail dated 1/26/2016 which was for less than the previous bill.  So, my curiosity got the better of me and I dived into the numbers to see what was adjusted.  \n\nLong story short (and I can go into the numbers if you like), they didn't deduct any interest that was due on the account, only principle that was due.  Also, it seems to take more than one billing cycle for them to do this.  \n\nSo....since this is true and I have the math to prove it, what is the surety for the interest?",
