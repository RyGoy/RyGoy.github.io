   "message": "On a July Water Bill, the balance forward was 807.20, the current charges were 190.73 and the interest was 57.61.  It seems (the math works out) that the 807.20 and the 57.61 were paid, but the 190.73 was carried forward.  The total of this bill was 1055.54.  \n\nThis doesn't make sense, unless this trustee was keeping a balance in their Accounts Receivable or something.",
