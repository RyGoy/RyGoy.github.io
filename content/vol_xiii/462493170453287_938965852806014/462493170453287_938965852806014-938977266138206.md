   "message": "What's the difference between this case and the time I dealt with my bin/trash collector? Dunno if you remember, PANDA was the company name. I set up an account over the phone and after a while they introduced a new charge which in response I sent a notice of mistake followed by a completed bill of exchange... Which they returned, so payment refused etc...\n\nI remember you saying that waste collection is the municipality's responsibility (or something similar)... How, as the holder of the bill, am I not surety in that instance? \n\nThey've been looking for the account to be settled for quite some time now yet the service has not been stopped...",
