You CONSENTED to be SURETY for that ACCOUNT when you APPLIED (Begged and signed) for hydro. Legally all they must do is give NOTICE by way of STATEMENT\n\nIf it has a signature on it, it is a BILL. If it has an ENDORSEMENT (Second Signature) it is a BILL OF EXCHANGE. The TRUSTEE is the corporation you got the BILL from. \n\nALL BILLS HAVE TRUSTEES.\n\nThere. Everything you need. Start there.",
