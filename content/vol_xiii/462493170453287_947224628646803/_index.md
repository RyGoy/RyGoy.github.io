   "message": "Oh Fuck! :/ \n\nRobert Menard > Canadian Monetary & Economic Reform\nYesterday at 6:57pm\n\nAre you a political activist? Agent of social change? Are you an entrepreneur or new product developer? Author? Healer? Philosopher? Live an alternative life style? Musical or Comedic Artist? Opinionated asshat? Researcher, budding journalist or reporter? Alternative media operator? Are you inspiring and encouraging? Are you weird? Do you have a unique story to share? Do you crave justice? Do you have an event to advertise? Are you dealing with government bullies and need some public awareness of your plight and struggle?\n\nEmpowermentality is a new web based radio show hosted by Robert Menard and Derek Govini. Half hour segments will cover a wide range of topics, from art and alternative lifestyle options, current events, debates on community issues, social justice, law, government, money, interviews with authority and/or public figures, and generally our place as temporary sentient beings in the infinite cosmos. Pretty much any topic with a focus on being inspiring and empowering, well seasoned with humour.\n\nRegular co-hosts and correspondents will include world renown comedians, rising musicians, unknown poets and maybe a puppet.\nWe want to present interesting, inspiring and positive stories, ideas and products. We are always looking for guests to share their stories, art, products, ideas, and efforts. We are also auditioning for re-occurring correspondents, co-hosts and content producers. Please contact Rob at theempowermentalityshow@gmail.com and let us know how we can help you!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/516573461732032/permalink/1058617797527593/",
