   "message": "Confidence artists remind me of producers of bad movies.  Both employ tactics to entertain, titillate, scare, etc.  They usually imply they have a valuable product or message - but they rarely do.  Funny thing is, they never have a shortage of people who will buy into their crap.  Like Whack-A-Mole, when they are banged on the head and disappear, they always appear with a similar look in another location.  Keep in mind, however, that they have collected their reward (usually monetary) before they move on.",
