   "message": "Scott Duncan, it is my understanding that there are some specific rules to follow if you receive a Bill of Exchange/Negotiable Instrument. \n\nIf there is something wrong with the instrument, it was supposed to be sent back (the original instrument with no endorsements or makings) within certain amount of days (I think is 3 days). If this is not done, the rules say there is DISCHARGE. \n\nAlso, if there is nothing wrong  with the instrument, and they REFUSE the instrument, there is DISCHARGE. If the instrument was endorsed by them on the back, that means they are surety for that Bill.\n\nIs all this correct?",
