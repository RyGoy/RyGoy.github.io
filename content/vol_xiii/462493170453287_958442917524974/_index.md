   "message": "I asked the Question yesterday, to Michel Lebrun, ex-lawyer from Le Barreau du Quebec.\n\nHe likes to tell everyone that he resigned from Le Barreau.\n\nWe know he got pushed overboard, but he really like to tell folks that he resigned, anyways.\n\nYesterday he was doing a presentation on HOW and WHY there's no LAWS in Quebec. It was very professional, and the man knows his shit......and he is not wrong in his line of thinking. Quebec never signed that 1982 thing (Constitution of Canada), so therefor, there�s no constitution in Quebec, so how in the fuck there can be any laws��but ok�.\n\nHe doesn�t talk about MONEY, he doesn�t talk about �This Note is LEGAL Tender�. Because if he would, all his presentation would be falling apart :D\n\nAnyways�..question times\n\nMe: Is it true that the Quebec Charter takes precedence on ALL other laws, here in Quebec?\n\nHim: Well, hummm, you know, well�there�s no laws, heu (you see me going here :D)\nSo he went at his white board with these pens, and thrown a 15 minutes answer at me, and before I could do anything, called a cigarette break :D\n\nSo of course when I came back from that break, I made sure to pose the question again :D\n\nBut again, he couldn�t answer, because it would have thrown all his presentation apart, see? :D\n\nSo, I have decided to ask about surety :P\n\nHis answer:\n\nIt is impossible for me to answer that question, it�s too large :/\n\nSo I told them about me using that surety for the last 4 years, and then he went and sat down :/\n\nI asked him, ARE YOU STILL HOOKED TO LE BARREAU DU QUEBEC ? ��he hesitated, and said a shy no.\n\nAnd then the guy who organized that thing got up and started yelling at everyone :-o he just wanted folks who agrees with them about Quebec having no laws.......a LAWLESS QUEBEC sort of.....\n\nSo I got up and left, before I start painting the wall with his open skull :D\n\nHere's their website (I just went there to question that lawyer) :P\n\n",
