   "message": "Fuck sakes this is redundant.  Pete is trying to politely weed out pieces of shit.  So here are a few things about this group.  Intro fucking duce  yourself.  Politely keep banter to a minimum.  Have you ever heard the saying \"there is no such thing as stupid questions?\" Do you happen to agree with this statement? Perhaps you are in the wrong group.
