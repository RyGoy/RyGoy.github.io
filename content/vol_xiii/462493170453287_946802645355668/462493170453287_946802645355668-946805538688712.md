I said bind them to what? The legislation that we ared all supposed to be equal under?  He said you are not using those words correctly.  So i asked explain it to me then.  He goes you wont get it.  So i called him a lying sack of shit.  My step dad the accountant piece of shit apologized for his sons behaviour.  And i said dont apologize to this fucking clown.  we left immediately afterwards",
