   "message": "That should reveal something right there. They ALWAYS try to associate me with the Free-Dumbers. ALWAYS.\n\nSo show me a Scott Duncan victim. Go on! Show me!\n\nIf you find one, they are lying. It really is that simple, and it's VERY hard to fight someone like that. So they try to smear me with Clifford/Menard shit, in hopes people will dismiss me as another free-dumber.\n\n...and I'm STILL right. They just don't want anyone to know.\n\nWant to do something? CALL THEM OUT on it. When they counter your facts with bullshit, then PEOPLE SEE IT. It's not something you are \"making up\", as you will often be accused of, because you can SEE it. THE TENDER FOR LAW exists for the same thing, except we aren't lying to anyone. This just makes people look very silly, historically. THEY will delete threads and censor (and then call people liars for pointing it out) so screenshots are essential.\n\nIn the end, they will say you are wrong, because \"magic parchments\", and \"that's just the way it is\", followed by hours of why it's OK to continue the victimization of everyone.",
