   "message": "No lawyer is worried about a Quatloser \"exposing the truth\".\n\nThe same cannot be said about ME. Its worse than that! They (Law Society interests) blame the GOVERNMENT for MAKING me (Which they totally did). The Government counters (correctly) that anyone who had a hand in that is dead, or no longer in government \"service\", so I'm not the Government's problem (They are mistaken).\n\n5: I bought this \"law\" and I didn't get what I payed for. Ergo, there is no \"law\" as the layman understands it. If you can ignore the \"law\" then so can I. I don't have the right to grant you a right that I don't have, and neither does anyone else. That doesn't change with a gang.",
