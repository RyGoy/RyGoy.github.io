   "message": "Anything Pete Daoust does, validates what I say, and Lawyers can get in a bit of trouble when that happens. I know it's not real in YOUR world, but it is, in theirs: I'm the guy who responded \"why\" when called to the BAR.\n\nI really am their \"Satan\". Many say I don't exist. Many say I'm exaggerated tales, and many have nightmares about what I might do to them. Just like the Satan legend.\n\nMy \"crime\" is truth and knowledge. I harm people but fewer than 20, while they harm MILLIONS. Just like the Satan myth. \n\nNotice that they refer to NOTICE OF MISTAKE as \"notice of error\"? If not, then you weren't as \"sucked in\" as you'd like to believe :P",
