   "message": "YEARS have passed. Suddenly there's HINDSIGHT.\n\nPeople will notice the past record. People will ask the same questions and will see what I say is TRUE. The problem is that they all BELIEVE some bullshit, which they mix with what I say. They really think \"all belief is evil\" applies to everyone, except them, and their oh-so-precious bullshit. *cough* Quantum Gail *cough*\n\nThat's as close to a \"victim\" as you can find, and she's a cautionary tale about what happens when you cherry-pick what I say. You DON'T get to do that. If it contradicts what I say, it's WRONG. That's not \"arrogance\"; It's VERIFIABLE. ALL of it.\n\nIn the end, the only issue people have with me is their idiotic hurt feelings. \n\nThat's what is being taught in Universities these days. They have taught an entire generation of young \"adults\" that hurt feelings are worth inflicting violence and removing rights. All of them would gladly see me silenced. Think about that. I'm one of MANY they would silence.\n\nTruth is becoming a \"criminal offense\". It's time to fight back. I am both free and crippled. I'm working 24/7 EVERYWHERE behind the scenes. I'm building at a pace that I can't keep up with.\n\nI need help :/",
