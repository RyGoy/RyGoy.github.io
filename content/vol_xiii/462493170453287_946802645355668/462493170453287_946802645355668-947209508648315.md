   "message": "I mention it, because that's what they see when they read \"Scott Duncan says HI\" notes. They see it as terrifying NOTICE. It's fun to use, I get that. They totally deserve it, too! You are ridiculing them, but they see it as threatening them. They can't DO anything about it, because they would have to tip their hand, in order to explain it to anyone...\n\n...so they're stuck. \n\nWe are talking out in public, with a record. We are already deploying an UNALTERABLE record in front of EVERYONE.\n\nYou can't stop it. Ever. It's far too late for that, and they know it. Shutting ME up won't help anymore. I've said too much. Too many people asked the right questions, and now THE TENDER FOR LAW is a record of that...albeit hidden in the comments.\n\nI need to make a moderated forum that WE control. One that can publish statically whenever we like.\n\nThen we'll purge EVERYONE and only let a server bot post to THE TENDER FOR LAW. Then you have to play Battlefield 2142 to EVEN FIND US! :D",
