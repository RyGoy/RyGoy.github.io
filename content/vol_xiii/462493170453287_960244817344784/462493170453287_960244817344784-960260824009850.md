   "message": "I recently had the elections manitoba fuckers show up and pull similar shit.  Stupid questions. \"Why wouldn't you want to vote.? \"  I said cause voting changes nothing.  \"It's your obligation to vote.\"  I said what about your obligations.  Public trustees are in breach of trust and you have the nerve to try and tell me I have obligations.  So I voided her forms with a stamp as a courtesy and told her not to come back",
