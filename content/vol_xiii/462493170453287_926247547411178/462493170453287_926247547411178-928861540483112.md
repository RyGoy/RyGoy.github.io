There's a reason he's always mentioned that he has an agenda, and unless you have the hubris to claim you understand that agenda, you should be very careful about acting on what Scott Duncan wishes.\n\nHe's inspiring, yes. But never forget that you are not Scott Duncan. Do you know WHY he says he want you to say \"Scott Duncan says hi\"? If you don't, then DON'T DO IT!",
