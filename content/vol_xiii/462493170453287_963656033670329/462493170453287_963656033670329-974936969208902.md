   "message": "I received the same Bart, and the extra charges on the account statement. They wrote to me and said that they were not bound by the BOE act. Yes they did. \nI rang the Legal Department in Irish Water and asked to speak to the Legal Service Dept. They don't have anyone there by that name apparently. Any way the girl in charge in the legal dept. is Cheryl, and she wouldn't give her surname.\nI sent it all back to them and informed them that I am unable to administrate the latest account statement, because they have not completed their administration process of the BOE I had sent to them previous. When they have completed the BOE, I told them to send out the new account statement.\nI also said if you are not bound by the bills of exchange act, send back the completed bill of exchange that I sent to you, with a Notice of Refusal. I promise I will pay if I am not entitled to use the Security of the Person to discharge PUBLIC DEBT. \nThat's about a month ago now.\nI also reminded them that the holder of the bill ALWAYS has surety.\nThe thing here is, is that ECOHR is an act in Ireland. We have no rights against the government. \nThis company is a PRIVATE company charging persons for a PUBLIC service. \nSo, they must comply with the statute book, yes?",
