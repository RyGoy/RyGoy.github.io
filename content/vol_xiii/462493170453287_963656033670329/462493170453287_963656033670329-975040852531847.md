As long as you understand WHY you are doing this, you will ALWAYS have the right answer.\n\nI wish I'd produced more in the past few years, but sadly Pete Daoust is the best out there, with some notable \"close seconds\". Personal integrity is rare. Lots of people CLAIM to have it, but few people actually do. Pete Daoust is one of them. It's what drives his questions.",
