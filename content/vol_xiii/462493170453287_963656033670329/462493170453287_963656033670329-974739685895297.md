   "message": "I have finally recieved correspondence from Irish Water Legal Services Department with regards the two NOTICES I sent in January and February of this year. The letter states \"your obiligation to discharge your water charges bill arises from section....bla bla..The letter goes on to state that they do not PROPOSE to engage in SUBSTANTIVE CORRESPONDENCE with me with respect to this matter where they believe it to be FRIVOLOUS AND VEXATIOUS. I remain liable for the original charge and it appears I am not now liable for the next quater that they subsequently billed. They also go on to state that I may seek my own legal advice and that if I fail to pay the charges it shall be recoverable by Irish Water as a simple contract debt. The question, can I use the SECURITY of PERSON I possess was not answered and there was no mention of the COMPLETED BILL of EXCHANGE I sent to them with CONSIDERATION attached. The letter was also signed Legal Services Dept.",
