   "message": "Are the 3 citizens SURETY, at least until they remove that presumption, for the documents they notarize?\n\nHere I'm thinking about Sino being held as surety  - which is a reference that is a bit like trying to find the similarities/differences between apples and oranges. \n\nI don't want to encourage friends to ACT as a NOTARY if they are going to potentially find themselves charged like Sino was.\n\nAny extra precautions/steps they/I should take? \n\nShould I/they give a NOTICE first to the Attorney General, that they will collectively ACT as a Notary and give him x days to respond?",
