   "message": "Still that's pretty shitty. I value when people labour for me an I never forget it. The Fender is a profoundly flawed idiot, but when he was labouring  on my behalf I made it claer that it will ALWAYS be acknowledged. He just doen't know what a friend IS. He's never really had one. He traded that for \"belief\" and he won't accept it.\n\nI never speak Ill of him, no matter what he may say about me. That's just one example.\n\nI NEVER forget ANYTHING ANYONE has spent time on, FOR ME.\n\nNeither should any of you.",
