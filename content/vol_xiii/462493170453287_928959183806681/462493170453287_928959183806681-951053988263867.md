Go suck off a priest, or a \"reverend\" or whatever you delusional fucks do to talk to your imaginary friend.\n\nYou don't get to benefit by meaning ME harm.\n\nI mean THEM harm, because they are evil, ignorant and delusional...and they have an imaginary friend their government invented. I GET to mean them harm. It GOOD to mean them harm.\n\nI tell the truth. I'm sorry that hurts your feelings. I'm sorry I want to make you cry, by being right, but tough shit. Reality doesn't care!\n\nStarve. Die. Be caged, and leave jail with NOTHING. That is a choice you made. You are the idiots who think your delusion is real and that \"Jesus has the answers\". Look where it lead you. FREEEEEEEE-Dumb.",
