   "message": "I met Dean in 2013. I quickly discovered the following truths about Dean:\n\n1. He can't plumb anything worth shit. The plumbing mistakes he made at the building we were doing together added up to about 50,000 to replace (that was the estimate, it was a big building)\n\n2. He totally lies to everyone because he actually holds a valid diver's license.\n\n3. He can't pay a bill to save his life: he got locked in jail once owing me 1800$ (customer was nice enough to square that up for him)\n\n4. He uses people in his personal life when it suits him and he needs something\n\n5. He screwed up another house after he got out of jail and the plumbing was once again FULL OF mistakes.\n\n6. He got locked up in jail AGAIN and CURRENTLY owes me more than 1000$, and had been ignoring me for the two months prior to his sentencing hearing (YES HE LEFT ME HANGING AT CHRISTMAS TIME, THE FUCKER).\n\n7. He is careless to the point of hazard. He almost burnt down the house we were working on by leaving heating equipment running, unattended, and ON TOP OF PAPER for fuck sakes.\n\n8. Dean wants and needs both other people's money and their approval and attention because he has ORPHAN SYNDROME. But he will not appreciate it because he is a sociopath.",
