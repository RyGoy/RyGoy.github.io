   "message": "I am not independently wealthy, I just can't stand fuckers. So I get to do stuff no one wants to do, like jumping into garbage containers so I can find garbages, clean them, and exchanging them for whatever I want/need :D\n\nI started this years ago, when these gymnastic bills started piling up (daughters), and then piano bills and all kind of fucking bills :D\n\nWith time, you get to have these garbages coming to you, instead of you chasing them :P\n\nAnd I don't have to deal with fuckers, well, not for long anyways.....\n\nI know it's not the most sexier thing to do for a living, but I don't care how much a dentist makes, I really don't :D\n\nThe last \"job\" I had, it was 1999. I was making a ridiculous $90k / year as an employee... :(\n\nWhere the fuck can you go with this ? :/",
