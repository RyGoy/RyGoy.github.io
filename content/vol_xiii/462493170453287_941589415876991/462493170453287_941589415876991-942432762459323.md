   "message": "Ceit recently signed us up for a 3-D printing course - more of a 3D orientation really - offered by the public library.  It seems they have acquired printers which can be used by members for a nominal fee.  I now have a shiny plastic library card, something I haven't looked at for over a decade.  \n\nI will probably not use their printer for a number of reasons which I won't discuss.  However, I did note they offer downloadable books and video courses that cover a wide variety of subjects including computer science.  Anyone \"in country\" may want to check this out - the lynda.com courses, especially, are of interest.",
