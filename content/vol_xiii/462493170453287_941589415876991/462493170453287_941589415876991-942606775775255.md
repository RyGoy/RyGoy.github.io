   "message": "Yes they do.  They now need to be renewed yearly. There is a small charge to replace a lost current card (I think it's $5), otherwise it's free.  They're fairly liberal with their identification requirements - a bill in an envelope and a credit card will suffice.  As mentioned they are offering various courses or seminars which may be of interest to some, although for us they are fairly rudimentary.",
