   "message": "Thanks Tara. What you've said is along with my line of thinking\n\nThere is nothing in place in our agreement saying they can or cannot do this. Which is why they are doing it.  They say \"Nothing says we can't. I told out Rep, nothing says they can either.\n\nOur union is pretty good. They know their stuff so it will be interesting where his goes.\n\nAs for the people. Well, what can ya say really\n\nAgain thanks",
