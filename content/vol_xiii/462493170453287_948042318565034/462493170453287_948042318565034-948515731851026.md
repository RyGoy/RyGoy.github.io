   "message": "The piece of shit will say \"But majik authoitee powerz\" and ignore that part.\n\nIn other news, I have a team of debt collectors, and they use what's called being \"dan wilsoned\". This is where the collectors announce they are here to collect the bill, and proceed to repeatedly kick the lawyer in the face until the bill is paid. As you may realize, it is very difficult to pay a bill while one is being repeatedly kicked in the face, and that's why you should pay your bills before I send debt collectors. :D\n\nIf I send debt collectors, it's because I care more about kicking you in the face than I do about any outstanding debt..",
