   "message": "\"Scott seems to think some \"Law Society\" is all-powerful and writes the laws, when in fact it's the legislatures that created the law societies and tell them what they can and can't do\" - Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson.\n\nI'm just going to quote him now.\n\nBefore I respond, stop for a minute and ponder the actions of this man. He created this profile JUST FOR ME, and it's not the first time he's done that. Does this seem rational to you? Is this something ANY of you, the readers, have ever even pondered doing?\n\nNo? \n\nWhy not?\n\nIs it because you think that is the behavior of a psychopath? If you do, congratulate yourself for having a sound mind. You would be correct.\n\nIn fact I hypothesize that 100% of profiles created to target one specific party, are created by psychopaths.\n\nIn the end he ALWAYS resorts to \"Magic Authority Powers\" and \"We have a gang of thugs with guns, so we're right\". He got there quicker than usual...\n\n...than usual. Yes, he's done it repeatedly. Why?\n\nWhy do this demonstrably idiotic and psychopathic thing?\n\nMagic Authority Powerz and we gots gunz. <---ALL of Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson's responses distilled into one line. The rest is Ad Hominem.",
