   "message": "The problem with making a living as a lawyer, is that it taints your thought process so much that they don't realize how stupid they will look afterward.\n\nThe Rogue Support page ALWAYS talks about what's coming, that I discreetly have my dirty little fingers in. We're building TAMPER-PROOF WEBSITES YOU CAN'T SHUT DOWN!\n\nWe're building contracts INTO money. All \"unproven technology\", that you ignorant Law Society twits will have to pay to try. Google \"Blockchain as a service\". THAT'S your fucking\"unproven technology\", you non-contributing, parasitic ZEROS.\n\nSee, with each of these Dan Wilson engagements, I always point out that while it's both Illegal and Unlawful to kill lawyers, it IS ethically sound to do so.\n\nIf you ever have to resort to cannibalism to survive, kill the lawyer first. All you will lose is dead weight, and it will be the first REAL contribution it has ever made.",
