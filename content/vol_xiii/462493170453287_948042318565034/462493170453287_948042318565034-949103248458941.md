   "message": "\"They also seem to think a lien against themselves under an act of the provincial legislature somehow magically supersedes Canada\" - He just lies, and lies, and lies, and lies, and lies, and lies, and lies, and lies, and lies, and lies, and lies. \n\nToday he lies about what I \"think\". A damaged security is a damaged security. Pretending \"magic authority powers\" changes that is fine, but then why worry about ANY lien then? If a lien is nullified by invisible magic authority powers, then a lien, by its very nature, cannot cause injury or liability for that matter.\n\nLying is saying that I think it \"supersedes\" ANYTHING. All I want is proof that I have ANY surety in that \"Magic Canada Parchment\" you cite.\n\nSuch a claim is a claim of OWNERSHIP. If ANY man or woman claims ownership of ME, I claim the right under that same \"authority\" to slit their children's throat. They consent.\n\nWhat? I don't have that right?\n\nYou mean I can't exercise a right someone else doesn't have?\n\nWhat if I delegate it! Can I get crew to slit their children's throats, for claiming to own me? \n\nNo?\n\nEXACTLY! NEITHER DOES THE LAW SOCIETY!\n\nYou don't get to claim a magic parchment binds you to servitude, no matter how many armed thugs you have.",
