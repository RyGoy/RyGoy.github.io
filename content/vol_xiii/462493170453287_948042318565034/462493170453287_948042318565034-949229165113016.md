   "message": "Hey Dan/Quatlosers! I STRONGLY SUGGEST you prepare your answer to WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL US! Because it doesn't really matter what you BELIEVE. What matters is what IS. I really have prepared a lifetime for this. This isn't hyperbole, as those who ACTUALLY KNOW me will testify.\n\nSteve Krupnik is the next party you are accepting surety for, as you are waiving any discretion that has been negotiated. (AQUILAE s.90-125) ...90125... Yes, like the Yes album. It's a coincidence.\n\nIf you decide I might just be scary enough to call upstairs, be sure to quote that. You may signal your understanding with \"YES SIR\".",
