   "message": "Correct me if I am wrong, but the PPSA, or UCC in the States, exists solely to make a claim.  It was put there by bankers so that bankers could claim stuff that was collateralized....legally  But, by making the Act available to bankers, it had to be made available to everyone.  ....or at least have that appearance (as there seems to be 2 standards, I'm getting pretty damn close to sure on this).  \n\nFast forward.  My TIME seems to be negotiable to some strangers.  I think it belongs to me, so I claim it, but to remove any doubt, I create a corporation to claim it because otherwise it would seem circular.\n\nIf my time does, in fact, belong to me and my name does, in fact, belong to me, why wouldn't it be wise to use an Act that was created by bankers and authorized by public trustees to secure whats mine?\n\nDan-Lien-Your-Name-Wilson, does any of this look wrong? :/",
