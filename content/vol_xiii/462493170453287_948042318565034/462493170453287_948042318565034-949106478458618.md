   "message": "Now he's resorted to \"We have a gang of armed thugs, and they will tell you what right you have.\n\nThis is why it's OK to kill lawyers.\n\n\"Scott still seems to think he can opt-out of constitutional provincial and federal legislation. He thinks a contract can stop the police and military from enforcing national and provincial law.\"\n\nHe then cites the oxymoronic \"Illegal Agreement\": An illegal agreement, under the common law of contract, is one that the courts will not enforce because the purpose of the agreement is to achieve an illegal end. \n\nViolating my rights is an illegal end.\n\nClaiming I have obligations for which there is no contract is an illegal end.\n\nThe courts are corrupt, virtually GUARANTEEING an illegal end.\n\nIf Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson wants to declare that the courts AREN'T corrupt, I will deem that a declaration from The Law Society of Upper Canada, and shall further deem it as an invitation to refute their claim that the courts are not corrupt.\n\nDan Wilson ALSO  accepts that he is addressed SOLELY as an AGENT of the Law Society of Upper Canada, as he has presented himself as such.\n\nTHE LAW SOCIETY OF UPPER CANADA agrees that this invitation by their AGENT waives any protection they may have from existing contracts and/or undertakings.\n\nSo go ahead Dan. Tell me the courts are not corrupt. You want to make LEGAL declarations, then YOU are SPEAKING AS AGENT you piece of shit.",
