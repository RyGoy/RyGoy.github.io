   "message": "The LAW SOCIETY has NOTHING to do with LAW.\n\nThey are the ones claiming OWNERSHIP over you. The people who own Burger King's Cows have nothing to do with Policy or Process implemented by Burger King.  It's the same thing. They claim to OWN you , and under the rules of Burger King (Government) They SELL you.\n\nThat's why I can LEGALLY claim Levitt's eyes and thumbs. I simply cite the same \"right\" they claim ownership over me with. :D\n\nIn fact ANYONE claiming OWNERSHIP of me OR my Person consents to me killing them...under that same \"authority\".\n\nEither I have \"rights\" or I don't.\n\nDon't like me exposing your Law Society's Fraud, Dan? They probably should have kept their word then! I STILL haven't breached that contract, and you are about to write a cheque for the Law Society that you can't cover.\n\nYou are GRANTING ME PERMISSION to POST those contracts. I ACCEPT YOUR CREDENTIALS. Govern yourself accordingly. ;)\n\nAnyway, we've already reached \"Magic Authority Powers\" and \"we'll send our thugs after you\"... we all get that. Saying it again, doesn't make it true.",
