   "message": "Think about this, dear reader. This man created a profile to tell me he's \"not debating\" my \"endless crap\". Now tell me, dear reader, have you EVER created a facebook profile to tell someone they aren't going to do something? Ever? Even once?\n\nHave you ever walked into a law office explicitly to tell a lawyer you aren't going to hire him/her?\n\nThis Saturday morning cartoon motivation you claim is driving you is believed by you and you alone. I GUARANTEE nobody else thinks this way.\n\n\"Scott, I'm not debating your endless crap. Find someone else to bother. All I care about is what happens in reality and in the public record. I'll await the case results. As Pete says, whatever happens we get closer to truth, and that's all that matters. Good luck.\" -Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson.",
