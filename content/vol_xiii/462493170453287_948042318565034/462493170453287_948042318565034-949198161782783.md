   "message": "That's a LIFETIME of silence. You KNOW ALREADY that I will keep my word! Donating $700, 000 to a trust for my silence is a bargain at TWICE the price... which it will be monthly. If you wait until APRIL, you will have to split it. I will not PROFIT. It's just what you owe AQUILAE. $700,000. The OTHER $700,000 is to go to the EFF.\n\nEvery month, it will not only become more expensive to shut me up, I'LL MAKE HARDER AND HARDER TO PAY ME. MONEY AND UNDERTAKINGS is the price of silence. \n\nAgain, NOT NEGOTIABLE.",
