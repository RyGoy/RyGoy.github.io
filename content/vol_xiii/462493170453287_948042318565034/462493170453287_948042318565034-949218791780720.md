   "message": "\"Scott apparently still believes in the #freedumber idea that failure to respond to an offer creates a binding contract. This is false. See Felthouse v Bindley\" - Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson declining the GENEROUS offer to the Law Society I made. \n\nNot courteous at all!\n\nAnd he lies about what I \"believe\", AGAIN.\n\nHey Dan, your leash holders have bound you to shit you don't know about. Don't worry, though! Most people haven't read the Motor Vehicle Act but they still have a driver's licence.\n\nI know, in your limited experience, that it is REASONABLE to BELIEVE I have \"delusions of grandeur\", but that doesn't change reality.\n\nIt's up to the AGENT to understand their duties and obligations of their master. You are welcome to BELIEVE what you like. Here in reality, you and the Law Society will NOT be able to plead ignorance.\n\nYuo have NOTICE. You have a LICENCE. I win. It says so in contracts I'm soon going to talk about, with YOU (Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson) as SURETY for it. \n\nFuck it. You AND anyone licenced by the Law Society of Upper Canada, over at the Quatlosers, too.\n\nI negotiated that DECADES ago. Believe what you like, Dan. Reality won't care.",
