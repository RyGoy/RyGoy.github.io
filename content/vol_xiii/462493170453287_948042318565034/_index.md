   "message": "I have it on good authority, that Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson is being pressured by his handlers to do damage control on my whole Lien-Your-Name thing. It seems it is becoming more popular now.\n\nDid you know there are people reading THE TENDER FOR LAW, who have never messaged, and are not \"friends\" with any members? Well it's true! In fact they outnumber you all by 10x! I know this, because we get messages at least once a week, thanking me for giving the answer they were looking for. Those heroes are all liening their names.\n\nSo Dan Lien-your-name Wilson [ https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011220335020 ] (Remember to screen-cap!) has created a brand new profile and is talking about \"Illegal Liens\". He also has the misplaced Tyrian Lanister quote \"When you tear out a man�s tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you�re only telling the world that you fear what he might say\", as is MY not tolerating his lies is somehow \"cutting out his tongue\". Mister Wilson, if I ever cut out your tongue, it will be to watch you drown in your own fluids, not because of any \"fear\" I might have. Nothing you have to say \"frightens\" me. I also have NO obligation to  provide a platform for your lies. What I say is correct, and true, and anything that is said, which contradicts what I say, in ANY way, is by its very nature, A LIE!\n\nTL;DR: I'm telling the truth, and Dan Wilson is lying. It's just that simple.\n\nLet's refute any lies he's going to tell about LIENS, by covering what he is sure to omit. I'll dumb it down to the point where it hurts, so you won't be confused, so you'd  better appreciate this.\n\n1: IF YOU LIEN IT, YOU OWN IT. THAT'S WHAT A LIEN IS; OWNERSHIP OF TITLE. YOU NOW HAVE SUPREME LEGAL AUTHORITY.\n\n2: IF YOU LIEN YOUR NAME, YOU OWN IT. YOU ARE THE SUPREME LEGAL AUTHORITY OVER THAT NAME. YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT, BUT YOU OWN IT. IT'S YOUR FUCKING RIGHT.\n\n3: IF ANYONE ATTEMPTS TO USE THAT NAME, FOR ANY PURPOSE, WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SECURE IT!\n\nTHAT'S IT. PERIOD!\n\nYOU DON'T NEED A STRANGER'S FUCKING \"PERMISSION\" DO DO ANYTHING WITH YOUR PROPERTY! YOU OWN IT! THE END! ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE, IS LYING TO YOU! WHEN THEY TELL THAT LIE, THE RESPONSE SHOULD ALWAYS BE \"THAT NAME IS OWNED (Secured)\", and there CAN only be ONE lawful administrator, which will NEVER CHANGE. IT CAN'T.\n\nSo when Dan Lien-your-name Wilson starts quoting acts, codes, and statutes, remind him that I FUCKING OWN IT trumps all those magic parchments that arise from it.",
