   "message": "<<Why is he trying to cite AUTHORITIES if he's not a lawyer?>>\n\nLou Manotti, I see a clear attempt from \"Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson\" to maintain alive the believe in \"authority\" in those \"Justices\" to the most ignorant of the readers. He wants these readers to BELIEVE that a RIGHT that your person has, such as SECURING/placing a LIEN in the fucking name, it's been done \"without real authority,\" which is implied to be all those \"magic parchments\" from the Law Society being recited by Dan.\n\n\"Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson\" interactions with Scott Duncan have definitively helped me understand better WHY I can place a lien/secure the name, and how to do it, step by step. \n\nHey, SLAVE HANDLERS, I know WHY I can SECURE/LIEN the name... because FUCK YOU! That's why! And I'll have to thank Satoshi, because after I place a LIEN in the name and then some try to starve the name, I will have OTHER kind of MONEY that I can use, so I can keep singing \"Because, FUCK YOU!\"",
