   "message": "ok...so he deleted everything else, but now this:\n\n\"Who's the surety for persons?\" - Ultimately persons, be they citizens, John Does, stateless individuals, corporations, trusts, etc., rise and fall within the interconnected municipal, provincial, national and (through treaties) international legal fiction world of paper, so you could say the government created them and is responsible for them. These persons are then forced upon men, and we are enslaved to our own insane machine, for better and worse, as long as people keep participating. There may indeed come a time when humanity embraces self-sustainability and individualism and it all comes crashing down. There could also be an ultraviolent dictatorship installed on a global scale. It could go a lot of ways. Things change over the ages. What we have now may or may not last long. Either way flying through space on this rock is interesting as fuck.",
