   "message": "Go tell your fucking leash holders to drop $700, 000 in cash off at my agent's door [2909-210 Victoria] to buy my silence. I promise it will go directly into trust. The price doubles every month. On April 1st, the price doubles. ($1,400,000) I'm giving the remainder of February as a COURTESY ;)\n\nThere's NO DEBATE. My entire life is PROOF that there is NO DEBATE. Your ilk should have just kept your promises. it doesn't matter if the AGENTS making those promises are dead/retired/retarded.\n\nRespond YES SIR, if you understand. YES SIR ONLY. Any other response will be deemed permission BY THE LAW SOCIETY OF UPPER CANADA, to publish ANY AND ALL agreements made with MYSELF.  You may delete the profile after you do.\n\nSee, I'm not debating either. Go tell your master, bitch.",
