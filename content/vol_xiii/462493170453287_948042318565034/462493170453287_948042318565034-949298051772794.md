   "message": "It's 2016. I can do what I like! I'd sell the Law Society out for a Twinkie at this point, So a Quatloser is WAY better. They have tried for years to associate me with Free-Dumbers. They are constantly lying about me, and what I say, so now they are surety for their actions!\n\nGot a BAR licence? I get to leverage it. I don't care of you are 2 times removed from the fucking party. Quatlosers who are members of a LAW SOCIETY AND are LICENCED to \"practice Law\"... well your leash-holders and I have a contract that says I can leverage your licence for JUST THIS PURPOSE. I've given LOTS of notice so you guys literally asked for it.",
