   "message": "You just brush it off as \"delusions of grandeur\". I WANT you to.\n\nQuote all the case law you like. I know you are too stupid to get it, but these are EXISTING terms I can leverage. You are AGENT and are addressed as such. Your ONLY recognized interaction with me is in the capacity of AGENT of the Law Society of Upper Canada. You re bound because under those agreements I HAVE THE RIGHT TO.\n\nSo quote all the case law you like, but that doesn't change the fact that your LICENCE binds you. You are Agent. Your licence says so. You are DRIVING, your licence says so.\n\nAs I said, you'd best ask if I'm just crazy, or if someone COMPETENT at damage control can cover this, because you really are, very publicly digging a hole for the Law Society. It doesn't matter if you \"believe\" I'm \"crazy\".\n\nThe Internet never forgets. Soon even deleting won't be possible. Let that sink in. THAT'S NEXT. Documents that CANNOT BE DELETED.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning",
