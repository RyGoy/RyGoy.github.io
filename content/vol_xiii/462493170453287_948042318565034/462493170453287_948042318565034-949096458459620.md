   "message": "\"Apparently TFL still hasn't learned that you can't lien without the debtor's permission. You'd think they'd clue up when one of their members had an order for $22,500 against them for doing the exact same thing:\" - Saying the same thing over and over, won't make it relevant. It is TRUE that you require the DEBTOR'S PERMISSION! ABSOLUTELY!\n\nNow, how would you PROVE that you have the debtor's permission? PRODUCE A CONTRACT.\n\nIf commerce is IMPOSED, you ALWAYS have the right to lien, TO SECURE COSTS. If an \"Authority\" is endorsing the imposed contract, that AUTHORITY is giving permission through its own AGENCY.\n\nIf Wal-Mart attempts to impose commerce, I inform the AGENT that Wal-Mart will be billed. It is your RIGHT to SECURE COSTS.\n\nI'll say it again, IT IS YOUR RIGHT TO SECURE COSTS.\n\nIt's true both times. ;)\n\nANYONE and EVERYONE who says it is NOT your LEGAL RIGHT to SECURE COSTS, IS LYING TO YOU. PERIOD!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=157730117944332&id=100011220335020&notif_t=story_reshare",
