   "message": "It's what the Quatlosers do. They try desperately to attach this shit to me.\n\nI pay my mortgages. ALWAYS. \n\nIf you conjure a mortgage into existence, like Levitt did, I can lien your ass. \n\nIf I sign it, I consented. If they breach a contract it is my right to secure it. Saying otherwise is a lie.\n\nIf you impose commerce on me, I do NOT need your fucking permission to secure costs.\n\nIf you keep generating costs, you are granting me permission to lien it. I don't need your permission to secure costs.",
