   "message": "When the Law Society starts screaming \"breach of trust\", I'm pointing them at the Quatlosers, and I'm pointing them here.\n\nThen they will be instructed to suck it up. To the lawyers who's lives I'll ruin: You should have stepped up when you were asked. You already made your choice and I warned you all. You agreed, remember? You ALL know I can prove it too. Remember ALL THOSE CAMERAS? They were in the room for a reason. It's not just a hobby ;)\n\nSame with recordings. ;)\n\nWhat do you think, Bruce? The entire ADR Sessions playable by EVERYONE? When these recordings were made, you couldn't even imagine the possibility, but I know in hindsight you now know I saw it coming before EVERYONE. It's just what I do. I make people who listen to me, OBSCENELY rich. When you know what's coming, you can spent a pittance and it will become a fortune, EVERY time. \n\nI'm building the infrastructure to BUY that ability off of me.\n\nAt any given time there are MAYBE 20 people who are ACTUALLY listening to me. The rest of you only get bits and pieces.\n\nI've built quite the war-chest and it's time to start a proactive assault on the Law Society.\n\nI will only write words and point you to things. Any violence that occurs will come from those who realize what you do to them. I intend to show them.",
