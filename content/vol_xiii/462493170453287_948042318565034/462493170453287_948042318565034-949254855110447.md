   "message": "\"I'm no lawyer, I just have an unhealthy obsession with law right now\"\n\nIt's of course just my opinion, but this statement is disturbing.  This may seem like a reasonable comment, but think about other situations where you might not be compelled to take such a person's advice.  \n\n\"You can trust my dietary advice...I have an unhealthy obsession with eating.\"  You can trust my advice on vaccinating your children...I have an unhealthy interest in researching the dangers of this practice.\"  \n\nWhen someone takes an \"unhealthy\" interest in my business, I do wonder about their motivation for so doing.  For instance, while you might stop and help someone who has fallen in the street, you don't usually prowl the nooks and crannies to find people to help.  When people say they are trying to protect you, it's always good to determine their motivations.  In most cases you can expect them to have reasons.\n\nIt's important to verify as much information as you can before blindly believing anything.  Several years with Scott should have at least taught you that.  I'd be interested to uncover what Dan Wilson's motivation is regarding his kind concern for your well-being.",
