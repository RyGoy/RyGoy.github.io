   "message": "Lawyers are trying the desperate tactic of LYING ABOUT WHAT I SAY. You've seen it before, except when Lawyers lie about what I say, people BELIEVE them, because they lie with \"AUTHORITY\".\n\nThis is when you need to confront these assholes HEAD ON! Michael Atkins and David-Paul Sip have been practicing. :D\n\nStay focused on REALITY. You are a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far. Everything else is shit we made. THAT is reality. The rest is up to you.\n\nHere in REALITY, the LAW SOCIETY is claiming to own you. This makes it OK to kill them, really. Slavery is illegal, so if they are claiming that I am a slave then so be it. It is your RIGHT (which you have clearly reserved) to do anything necessary, including killing, to escape that slavery. Even the \"law\" agrees. :D",
