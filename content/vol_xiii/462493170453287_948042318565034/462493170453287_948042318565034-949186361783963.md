   "message": "Bruce Smith and CIBC will not like you acting on the law society's behalf, Quatlosers/Dan. Guess who they will go after, when I disclose? NOT ME. Why am I so sure? I UNDERSTAND MY CONTRACTS. I can declare you AGENT because I UNDERSTAND my contracts, and I OBEY THE LAW to the letter.  EVERY CONTRACT I HAVE WITH THE LAW SOCIETY SAYS I CAN DECLARE A LAWYER AN AGENT! NO restrictions on how that applies. That's why SMART lawyers give me a WIDE BERTH. It's not a fight they can win.",
