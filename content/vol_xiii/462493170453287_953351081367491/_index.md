   "message": "T?lis B?auns reminds us, that you are all susceptible to sliding into your own self-created palace of bullshit.\n\nAs you know (or maybe not) Scott Duncan is trying to get across that it is both morally and ethically sound, to harm police. He does a good job! Go see at REASONS we need a NATIONAL KICK-A-COP-IN-THE-FACE DAY! (Personally, I'd enjoy that holiday, way more than Christmas), and he intends to do the same with Lawyers, here. It's pretty easy with cops. Just point to the videos. Done. It's very easy to convince people that cousin Jim-Bob the State Trooper isn't such a good guy, and that his death might benefit the community as a whole. You will also know he will get a paid vacation and no consequence for crimes you and I would get 15 years for. Face it. These days it's pretty easy to hate cops.\n\nLawyers are a bit harder. Cousin Moishe and Uncle Shlomo don't seem like people who should be killed. They have this De facto \"Victim\" status they would be granted, were we just to arbitrarily start putting bullets in their heads. You need to learn a few things first.\n\nYou need to learn how things work, and then learn how the LAW SOCIETY exploits it. To that end, materials will be posted here, over the next few days. These are being posted in order to assist you, in your quest to find \"proof\" of what is being said here.\n\nAs you are told repeatedly; NONE OF THIS IS HIDDEN. You simply believe bullshit you are programmed to accept as \"truth\". \n\nThis playlist is covering AGENCY.  The Fender was actually the first to discuss it here (go look), but wasn't actually covered much beyond that.\n\nOver the next few days, I intend to rectify that.",
