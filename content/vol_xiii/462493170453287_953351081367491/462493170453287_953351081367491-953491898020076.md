   "message": "I have never met Menard or cliford.  But I have met a free dumber who runs peace maker society here in Manitoba.  Essentially a Menard clone selling claim of rights packages for 1500 bucks.  Everytime I try to explain the issue with agency or tender for law it is met with insane violent reaction.  He has threatened me oN numerous occasions.  But refuses to answer the questions.  Except with a lame one line response similar to this not is legal tender cannot compel one to act.  And the argument dissolves into threat against me even a threat of a libel suit.  At any rate it appears belief is a strong component of this issue.  These men and women believe so strongly in wrong thinking and belief that they won't even have a discussion about it.  Fuck I'm rambling and not answering the question.  In summary this piece of shit ripped off a bunch of men and women by selling them magic parchments and is keeping all the money.  So having willfully committed fraud and stolen the money admitting it at this point is too much so they just start threatening",
