   "message": "They don't even have the option of buying my silence, now. Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson waived that option on behalf of the Law Society.\n\nToo bad, too. $700,000.00 is only a fraction of the damage I've caused to the society as a whole.\n\nThey should be quite upset that Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson acted without authorization. Too late now.\n\nBuying my silence is a bargain at twice the price!",
