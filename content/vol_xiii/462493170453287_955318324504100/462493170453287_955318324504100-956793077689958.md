   "message": "Some clarification needed... \n\nSo yesterday, having the notice filed in the case file, I was attending the hearing in a detached capacity. Not to administrate but to establish on the record that there was no evidence of surety or agency for the principal for the PERSON that was being charged. \n\nHowever, now that I've sent the letter DEMANDING the matter be discharged, I've now stepped into the administrator capacity, surety is arguable but not definite... Correct?",
