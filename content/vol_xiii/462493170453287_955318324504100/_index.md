   "message": "So, there's an administrative hearing for EAMONN O BRIEN on Wednesday morning. Notice of mistake is in the case file... Driving offences (7 in total, 2 made up) Deriving from when I was selling that speaker last year, if anyone recalls...\n\nThey always clock up as many charges as possible so on the day the justice is \"willing to drop these lesser serious ones\" so as to appear to give the defendant a good deal...\n\nI'll keep you posted... Only one question I need answering this time...",
