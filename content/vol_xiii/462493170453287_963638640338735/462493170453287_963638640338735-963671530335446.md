   "message": "Here's the thing. I do not have a conscience. Your government programmed that out of me a long time ago. On purpose, paid for by your Grandparents. I REMEMBER having a conscience as people describe, but I don't recall the feeling.\n\nI DO have profound empathy, far more, I dare say, than any of you, but only with what I can see, measure and quantify. I am literally Evil manufactured by your government, and I know this, so I set out at a very young age to understand as much as possible. Empathy dissolves evil. \n\nThis is why I have a rigid bookkeeping system I use in lieu of a conscience. It also makes time irrelevant.\n\nI mention this because Adam Thomas apparently messaged the Aquilae Trust page. Whoever was unfortunate enough to get the message, hopefully took screen-caps; \"We Get Letters\", and all that...\n\nThe point being, he tried to play the \"sympathy\" card. \"It's not me, it me bad breedin' choice... by crikey\"... I'm pretty sure that was verbatim.\n\nI DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR WRONG! I'M AT WAR WITH WRONG.\n\nI DO NOT FORGIVE WRONG. \nI DO NOT FORGET WRONG.\n\nIt was WRONG for ANY woman to let Adam Thomas stick his dick in her.\n\nI DO NOT ABIDE WRONG.",
