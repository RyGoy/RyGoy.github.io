   "message": "Most do not.\n\n...and these days \"hurt feelings\" seems to be the MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE of their lives.\n\nI'm told I'm supposed to be \"nicer\". I disagree. Those that postulate this \"Scott Duncan should be nicer\" crap, always seem to be the WRONG ones.\n\nTHEN when it turns out that I'm RIGHT, suddenly I'm supposed to treat them as some \"prodigal son\", who should be \"forgiven\".\n\nI'm getting a LOT of those these days. Burn bridges with me, and I'll make sure the bridge stays burnt.\n\nCourts must forgive. I have no such restriction/compulsion.\n\nISN'T THAT RIGHT Adam Thomas!",
