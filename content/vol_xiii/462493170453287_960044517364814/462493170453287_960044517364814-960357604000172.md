   "message": "1. The existing definition of �every one�, �person�, �owner� with its lengthy list of entities that are included was repealed and replaced with definition that includes only Her Majesty and an organization. In turn, the definition of �organization� lists the major players in the Canadian economy but it also includes any association of persons that has a common purpose and a structure and holds itself out to the public as an association. It is expected that this definition will cover any way that persons, including corporations, come together. It would include a joint venture of several corporations even if the joint venture was itself not incorporated. It might also cover neighbors who, for example, come together, elect an executive, open a bank account and send out a press release under the name of the association.",
