PAR COURRIERTOUS DROITS R�SERV�S / SANS PR�JUDICE\n\nDear Mister Marc Brochu Lawyer\n\nI have received the registered mail #LP418555324CA which YOU have sent to my PERSON.\n\nVou know very well that you have not received those bills of exchange as PAYMENT, but for a DEBT DISCHARGE. I don�t want to BUY BACK those debts, I�d rather use my person�s SURETY so that it can DISCHARGE those debts, for the simple reason that I�m sick and tired of BEING ROBBED. So, you writing that you have received those bills of exchange as PAYMENT is a LIE Mister Marc Brochu Lawyer.\n\nMoreover, you have only sent back one of the three bills of exchange, being # 15-00577-5.\n\nMoreover, you want $606.00 for that bill of exchange, which�s value is only $507.00.\n\nTake good notice, Mister the LAWYER, that by refusing those bills of exchange, you are refusing and/or ignoring and/or violating my fundamental right to my person�s SURETY and that your Bar Association will be informed of your HOSTILE intentions towards the PUBLIC.\n\nTake good notice, Mister the LAWYER, that I will keep this promise to PAY, as soon as you send back the missing 2 bills of exchange, and correct the accounting, as I do not have to pay for your incompetence, and at the moment at which you will ACCEPT that payment, it will be confirmed by YOU that you are declaring me your property and slave.\n\nTake good notice, Mister the LAWYER, that not only I am one of your victimes, but that Latraverse Huissier de Justice Inc and MALIDAN Inc then become your victims as well in this matter.\n\nAlso take notice that I am FASCINATED with your INCOMPETENCE and, unless your Bar Association confirms that you IN FACT own me and I�m your slave, I will FORMALLY demand your definitive revocation from this profession, as it is now evident that your intentions are HOSTILE towards the public.\n\nTake notice that had you well done your job, for which the puiblic is paying you, and had you sent back those bills of exchange a year ago, ME and my family, as well as Latraverse Huissier de Justice Inc, and MALIDAN Inc, would have been spared a lot of problems.\n\nBy this registered mail #LP418555324CA which you sent, you become SURETY in regards to ALL prejudices and/or violations of rights and/or criminal charges and/or claims which could be filed and/or made against you. Unless, of course, the Barreau du Qu�bec confirms that we are all your slaves and/or property.\n\nTake notice that your TAX collector AGENTS have forcibly taken my NAME, in regards to those three debts created by YOU.\n\nTake notice that I NEVER give my NAME, that NAME being MINE, to any Government AGENT without knowing WHO will be the party holding SURETY for those debts and/or TAXES that those Agents intend to create and/or demand.\n\nI literally REFUSE that MY LIFE be ROBBED by YOU. And that�s what Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the National Assembly of Qu�bec, enacted withinthe Charte des Droits et Libert�s du Qu�bec by giving me the RIGHT to the surety of MY person. That right has precisely been enacted to prevent YOU from stealing our lives.\n\nThe question is simple, am I the man who has the right to MY person�s surety ?, or am I one of your properties and/or slaves, and do I not have the choice but to have my life STOLEN by YOU, dear Barreau du Qu�bec.\nDear Agent Matricule 111, and Agent Matricule 116 from the Mirabel Police, I wish you take notice that you�ve been victims of FRAUD, on december 17th, 2015, during the Huissier MARTIN MERCIER�s visit at my place. You have received false information from that Bailiff, saying I didn�t send anything to the Ville de Terrebonne (Bills of exchange), which is, as you can now realize, is a lie. You also know that the WHOLE scene was filmed. You have threatened me and intimidated me, on december 17th, 2015, while you were assisting a THIEF, that�s filmed.\n\nSo, as the Canadian Criminal Code clearly states at articles 337, 339, 340 et 341 in regards to those bills of exchange that this Bailiff did hid from you, take notice that you�ve assisted a FRAUDSTER. I�m looking forward to see what you will do with this information. Know that I COUNT on you to PROTECT AND SERVE us, here, in this great city of Mirabel, and I PAY you for that service. Know that it would be reasonable and easy for me to CLAIM, dear Agents 111 and 116, I could go as far as register a lien on Mirabel for many $millions, just as I did against la Ville de Terrebonne, but no, I won�t, but I�d like if you could do something to right your wrong, arrest MARTIN MARCIER, because ALL must obey the LAW, and NOONE is above the LAWS. MARTIN MERCIER violated MANY of those laws, I offer you my help if you want it. MARTIN MERCIER entered my house, while I was out, and that, without my expressed or implied consent, violating articles 5, 7 et 8 of the Quebec Charter, BREAKING AND ENTERING, that�s pretty bad, isn�t it ? I have the tapes of three phone calls with M.MARTIN MERCIER HUISSIER AGENT DE LA PAIX which will prove with no reasonable doubt that he lied to you to steal from me.\n\nIf I don�t hear back from you, Matricule 111 and Matricule 116, I will understand that you don�t give a flying fuck about US, those who pay for you to PROTECT and SERVE us, and the public will be INFORMED of that.I claimed back those bills of exchange at least twenty times and PROMISED to pay if la Ville de Terrebonne refused them, I have proofs, if the Police de Mirabel don�t wanna do the job for which we pay, I will contact the Permanent Anti Corruption Unit, if the PACU doesn�t want to do the job for which we pay, I will contact the RCMP, and if the RCMP doesn�t want to do the job for which we pay, I will contact the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal if I have no other choice. Unless, of course, the Barreau du Qu�bec confirms, by a written declaration, that we�re all their slaves and/or properties\n\nDear Reporters, I am able to show you, in DETAILS, how we are being robbed here in Quebec, I am able to show you in DETAILS how we have the POWER to REFUSE that shameful robbery which as being going on for many years here in Quebec, I am not one of those dumbass Sovereign Citizens, I want to OBEY the LAW, because ALL must obey the LAW, and NOONE is above the LAWS, and that LAW starts with the Charte des Droits et Libert�s du Qu�bec. You could FILM me and use everything I will say AGAINST me if you wish so, but be careful, what you will learn, you can�t unlearn.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBY : _____________________________________________\nThe man who POSSESSES the Juridical Personnality named PIERRE DAOUST with inscription #1196604112851. You can laugh as much as you want, but that�s what the first article of the Charte du Qu�bec says, and it CLEARLY says so. 514-XXX-XXXX",
