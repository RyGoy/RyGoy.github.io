   "message": "This is an AWESOME time to mention the fact that you DON'T GET TO PICK AND CHOOSE THE PARTS YOU LIKE. You don't get to add stuff. You don't get to change words because you think they \"sound cooler\". \n\nIf you do, you will be jailed or killed. Government workers LOVE getting \"bonuses\" for making \"examples\" out of posers. This directly harms those of us who ACTUALLY know what they are doing. It makes our work that much harder.\n\nStupid government workers believe what their paperwork says, nothing more. Posers with bad paperwork sign their own death warrants.",
