   "message": "I couldn't believe my eyes for a second and had to read it twice to realize it was true...\n\nThe other day I picked up a book that, after an initial glance, promised to be apologetics for US history. I do this from time to time to both better understand how the \"other side\" thinks, and to understand \"their\" arguments.\n\nThe book is called: A Pocket History of The United States by Allen Nevins and Henry Steele Commager (Washington Square Press) first published in 1943. A number of pages in, the book started discussing paper money (rag money) created by each state, and then, on page 99, the very last paragraph...\n\n\"Since the rag money was a full tender for debts owed to other states,....\"\n\nI was beside myself. Never before, and until now, I had never heard of anyone besides Scott explain that the use of money was a tender for anything.\n\n***\n\nWhile this is 101 to us, it was quite a surprise to come across and I was so exited I \"just had to share\". It's still sinking in that at least two non Tender For Law members understood/understand the connection between the use of money and a legal tender.",
