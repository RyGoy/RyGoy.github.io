It will make you laugh, and it will make you angry.\n\nThen when you realized you've found what you are looking for, it will even tell you what to do.\n\nRight now it's just a bad pun. Its all it can be. When you understand it, you will know humiliation. You will TRULY understand just how fucking stupid you look.\n\nThen it will terrify you that I am speaking directly to you from the past ;)",
