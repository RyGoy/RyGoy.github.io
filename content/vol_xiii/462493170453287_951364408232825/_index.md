   "message": "Something for the curios eyes of AGENTS of all sorts, and readers in general.\n\nFor more than 3 years now: \n\n- Have you noticed that the members of The Tender for Law are NOT into \"sovereign citizen\" and/or \"Freedumber\" scams/frauds of wanting something for nothing? Noticed that the ones that did try to use this knowledge for those purposes, are no longer in the group?\n\n- Have you noticed that Scott Duncan has NEVER asked for a single dollar (donations) for any of the things shared here? At the contrary, he has given some of us the ability to MAKE money. But don't worry. It's not YOUR MASTER's money, so it's cool! :D\n\n- Have you noticed that \"sovereign citizens\" and/or \"Freedumbers\" go to prision, while the members of The Tender for Law are out FREE?\n\n- Have you noticed that NONE of the members of The Tender for Law are charging money for seminars, nor for any information acquired here?\n\n- Have you noticed that we have been taught here that EVERYONE is to obey the law, and that includes GOVERNMENT, and the LAW SOCIETIES?\n\n- Have you noticed that we have been taught to ALWAYS keep our promises, follow thru our contracts? And YES, that includes DEBTS that we SIGNED voluntarily to repay. But we also learned that there are public debts we did not create, and that we are not surety for those. The PRINCIPAL is SURETY. It's not our fault, it's the law!\n\nDo these folks here sound like \"terrorists\"? :/",
