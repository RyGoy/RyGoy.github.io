   "message": "http://m.imdb.com/title/tt3090252/\n\nI watched this documentary yesterday... Some of us may be familiar with the story... \n\nIt's about archaeologists digging up a T-Rex and paying the land owner in order to claim ownership and take it away to preserve it. \n\nUnknown to them though, the land they dug it up from was land held IN TRUST by the government for the native American Sioux tribe of which the \"land owner\" was a descendant and thus a BENEFICIARY... \n\nA long legal battle ensued and I won't spoil the ending... \n\nVery interesting from the legal/trust point of view if anyone wants to have a look...",
