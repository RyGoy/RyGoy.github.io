   "message": "The RIGHT to � life �\n\nI have spent a whole month just THINKING of this, seriously I really did :/\n\nThat was after I have read for the first time Tara Duncan. That first time I have read Tara, it just dawn on me on HOW it is important to choose and think about the word I use, and WHY I am using them��.so this RIGHT to LIFE just became crucial for me�.\n\nAt first, my thought process was, NO ONE CAN KILL ME. That was it, the right to life = no one can kill me :D\n\nBut then, this thought processing thing has changed a bit, more of Scott and Tara readings and suddenly, I started thinking deeper :D\n\nThe right to LIFE��what is a LIFE ?\n\nTo make a long story short, LIFE is ALL the hours I will SPEND, and/or SHARE, and/or GIVE, and/or BILL between first breath, and my last breath :D\n\nAnd the City of Terrebonne falls in the \"BILL THAT LIFE/TIME\" section :/   ...because I have the RIGHT to LIFE :P",
