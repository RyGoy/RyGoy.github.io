   "message": "\"The Freemen on the Land (FOTL) movement, a sovereign citizen ideology that has followers in Canada, the US and the UK, has been described in the past as an extremist organization capable of domestic terrorism by CSIS and the FBI\"\n\nThey lie in the opening line! \"The Freemen on the Land (FOTL) movement, a sovereign citizen ideology\"\n\nPiece-of-Shit Christians (POSC),  a Piece-of-Shit Muslim ideology...\n\nThat makes as much sense, and is just as accurate.\n\n1: \"Sovereign Citizen\" is an INVENTED NAME. It was created by the NSA, and a bunch of Good-ol-boys with guns and pseudo-confederate flags adopted it. The CIA invented the name AL QUEDA, and Bin Ladin adopted it. It's not a real thing.\n\n2: The term Sovereign Citizen is a blatant insult to the intelligence  of the user of the term. Look up the LEGAL meaning of SOVEREIGN (http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/sovereign) and then look up CITIZEN (http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/citizen) and you can see for yourself that the term is an oxymoron in its purest form.\n\nStop using the term Sovereign Citizen and DO NOT let ANYONE attach that label to you, EVER.",
