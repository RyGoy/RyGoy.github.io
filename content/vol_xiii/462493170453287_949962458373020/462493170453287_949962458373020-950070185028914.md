   "message": "I have reasons to believe Harry hasn't fully grasp what's happening here. Harry, do you believe that asking irrelevant questions, to folks that claim ownership over all individuals, it's some game to be played? Next question  \"What is a stone frigate\"? :/ \n\nOne thing I know it's a must to do it's to ask questions. But we must know the question we are making, because we should already know the answer. And I have come to notice, FRAUD doesn't want to write back! :D \n\nHarry Wombat, I know you are still on time to ask the right questions, and so are all of us. Don't let this comments \"make you feel bad.\" As I said, you are still on time to ask the right questions.",
