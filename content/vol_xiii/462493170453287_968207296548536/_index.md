   "message": "Hey, I have a QUESTION :/\n\nAt page 33, Table 12, I see a \"Fines, forfeitures and recoveries\" revenu fund in this table.\n\nI see that Quebec collected, from these \"Fines, forfeitures and recoveries\"\n\n$560 Millions in 2012\n$591 Millions in 2013\n$656 Millions in 2014\n$686 Millions in 2015\n\nAnd.....the forcast for 2016 is $727 Millions.......so here's my question...\n\nHow in the fuck they KNOW they will reach $727 Millions in \"Fines, forfeitures and recoveries\"?\n\nIf you then go at page 37, table 13. See what was the COST for \"JUSTICE\" in Quebec.\n\nCompare these numbers with funds collected from \"Fines, forfeitures and recoveries\" WHAT IN THE FUCK IS \"JUSTICE\"? Is it the sum of all, what they call themselves JUDGES ?\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/722803/000117625615000219/exhibit99-1.htm",
