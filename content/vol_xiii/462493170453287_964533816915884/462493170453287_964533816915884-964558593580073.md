   "message": "Then he lies and says about the LAW SOCIETY claiming OWNERSHIP of ALL INDIVIDUALS:\n\n\"No, lawyers can't buy and sell individuals. Legislators don't have to be lawyers... government force doesn't come from a law society, but from Parliament and the military and police. You're free to leave the country - what does that tell you about their \"ownership\"?\" \n\nThe question isn't about LAWYERS, it's about the LAW SOCIETY. Watch for these lies of distraction.",
