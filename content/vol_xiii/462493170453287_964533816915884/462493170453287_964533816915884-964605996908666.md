   "message": "So as a PERSON that is a legal fiction created by the BODY POLITIC is all they have AUTHORITY over that which they created and since they did not create the man or woman they have no AUTHORITY over said man or woman as long as said man or woman realizes they are not a legal fiction.  So the only AUTHORITY in a courtroom is the man or woman STANDING and speaking for him/herself and the BODY POLITIC and the AGENTS have no JURISDICTION over anything other than that legal fiction.  How close am I?",
