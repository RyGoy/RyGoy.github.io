   "message": "\"An association or company of persons (generally not Incorporated) united together for any mutual or common purpose.\" \nWhich led me to: association: \"The act of a number of PERSONS who unite or join together for some special purpose or business. The union of a COMPANY of PERSONS for the TRANSACTION of designated affairs, or the attainment of some common object. An unincorporated society; a body of persons united and acting together without a charter, but upon the methods and forms used by incorporated bodies for the prosecution of some common enterprise.\"\n\nOK...gonna be in that dictionnary all night me thinks. Not like i shouldn't be, right?",
