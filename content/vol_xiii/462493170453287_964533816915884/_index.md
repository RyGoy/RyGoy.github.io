   "message": "Let's see if I can get a \"Killer\" thread going like I could 3 years ago.\n\nFor the past couple of months, a couple of lawyers had the misfortune of engaging me, and a bunch of THE TENDER FOR LAW alumni. Needless to say, it didn't go well for them, and it opened a lot of people's eyes.\n\nNatasha Tutino found it eye-opening. She'll never look at a lawyer the same again!\n\nAll with TWO questions:\n\n1: What does an ATTORNEY ATTORN?\n\n2: Does the LAW SOCIETY claim OWNERSHIP of ALL INDIVIDUALS?\n\nFor the latest wave of new people, we have an AXIOM: LEGAL=The \"Law\" of SURETY and ACCOUNTING. If you study that AXIOM, you will understand EVERY LEGAL DOCUMENT ON EARTH.\n\nLook up the LEGAL definitions of EVERY word. ESPECIALLY if you think you know what it means. that's the LEGAL definition. \n\nThat's a first layer of lies that lawyers tell. They will ALWAYS try to convince you that you are speaking in \"Common Meanings\" and will even produce dictionaries and give you the precise COMMON definition. Natasha Tutino recently witnessed this. NEVER ACCEPT THAT THEY ARE SPEAKING ENGLISH! IT'S ALL LEGALESE! ALL OF IT! IT'S A LAWYER! IT CAN ONLY be \"LEGAL\";It CANNOT BE ANYTHING ELSE. EVER. <----remember that!\n\n...but I digress. I was going to use Derek Moran, but he turned out to be too stupid, so I'm going to try again with all of you. So let's start. We are going after the MOST hidden of all the \"none of this is hidden\" things I've shown you. This is a TRAINING exercise, so you can find and confirm EVERYTHING LEGAL that I say.\n\nYes this literally is the hardest one.\n\nLet's start with \"Societies\".\n\nWhat is the LEGAL definition of \"society\"?\n\nIf the SPCA is a SOCIETY for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, what's the LAW Society for?\n\nLet's answer these questions.",
