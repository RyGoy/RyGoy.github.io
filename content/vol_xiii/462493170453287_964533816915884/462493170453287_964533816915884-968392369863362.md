   "message": "Another profile (Made just for me) blocked.\n\nThis time I'm accused of \"not being able to deal with people\". I've never denied this. Most lawyers I'd rather Stick a hot soldering-iron in their eyes and ears, than have any sort of dialog with them.\n\nYes I get it. I'm causing the court system  an insane amount of trouble, as well as banks. I've taught too many people, too much. That doesn't mean I have ANY obligation to abide stalkers.\n\nYes. I \"can't deal with people\". I can't deal with people who create stalker profiles. i can't deal with lying lawyers. I can't deal with adults with imaginary friends.\n\nSO FUCKING WHAT! YOU are the inferior one, not me. I don't harm people through fraud. I don't claim to own people, and I don't have an imaginary friend. These are the kinds of people I \"can't deal with\".\n\nMy stalker seems to think I'm \"bad\" for this reason...and continues to stalk.\n\nSo let's talk about how it's both morally and ethically sound to blind lawyers and cut off their thumbs. :D",
