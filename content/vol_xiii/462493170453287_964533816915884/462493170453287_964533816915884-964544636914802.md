   "message": "Its weird... when inserting \"Law\" Society to the above definition, it sound a little \"self proclaimed\". Its a legally recognized term for bodies of PERSON coming together in a common goal...  no one asked them if their goal is share and desired to involved in its design; ownership of men and women who think they are persons.... \n\nSo this group of people defines words for themself and created a category they happily placed themself into... justifiying their existence through \"PURPOSE\" ;(",
