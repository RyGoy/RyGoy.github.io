   "message": "How much are you willing to do for the truth?\n\nIt's the title of a subject that has been in my thoughts for a while. I will perhaps write about it, but in the meantime I ask you to ponder that question.\n\nIt \"feels good\" to see the \"Likes\" on my previous comment, about ALWAYS be on the side of truth, by combating lies every time we see them. \n\nI know many are maybe not prepared to engage professional liars that hide behind fake accounts, but your comment and/or at least \"Likes\" of comments of our group members in those exchanges can be felt a lot more present.\n\nWe have been given a lot of knowledge, all free. Scott and Tara are being attacked, meaning that YOU (WE) are been attacked. So, I ask again, how much are you willing to do for the truth? :/",
