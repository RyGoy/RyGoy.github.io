   "message": "I don't think we answered Scott Duncan's 2nd question: Does the Law Society claim OWNERSHIP of all INDIVIDUALS?\n\nScott Duncan said look at the LEGAL DEFINITION ALL WORDS!\n\nWhen you look at the legal definition of INDIVIDUAL, Black's Law states:\nIndividual. As a noun, this term denotes a single person\nas distinguished from a group or class, and also,\nvery commonly, a private or natural person as distinguished\nfrom a partnership, corporation, or association;\nbut it is said that this restrictive signification is\nnot necessarily inherent in the word, and that it may,\nin proper cases, include artificial persons. See also\nPerson. \n\nThe last statement says it all.  If an INDIVIDUAL can be considered to include (not includes, so not limiting) an artificial person, then when the Crown representing the government comes forward making a claim, it is PRESUMED that they OWN THE INDIVIDUAL, and by default are presuming the individual is the artificial person.  That's where you need to break the presumption and clarify your status.  So when the LSUC states they own ALL INDIVIDUALS, it is true unless the presumption is broken.",
