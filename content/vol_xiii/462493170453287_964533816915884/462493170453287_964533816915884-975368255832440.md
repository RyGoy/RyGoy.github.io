   "message": "Just a quick reminder:\n\nWhile I have already sold the title to the eyes and thumbs of Douglas Levitt, Timothy Duggan, Brian Horlick, Wailan Low, and James Makris, I still have the titles of the eyes and thumbs of Deborah Knight, and F. Manuel Fernandez for sale at $50,000 each. \n\nTo those just joining: I don't accept money from people unless I am SELLING something. I SOLD the eyes and thumbs to those who owe me a debt.One even bought it as an INVESTMENT, because I have a very strict MONEY BACK GUARANTEE. If any of them need money, all they have to do id bring me the eyes and thumbs they own, and I'll give them their money back! :D\n\nI also don't care if the rest of the body is attached, or if they are even alive. Just bring me the eyes and thumbs, and I'll give you your money back.\n\nAlas, the two for sale still, aren't connected to the Law society or the government, so they are a LOT harder to sell. That's why they are so cheap. :D",
