But the relevant quote is often buried half-way down the Note-For-Idiots.\n\nI'm wondering if its acceptable to quote a line or paragraph from one of those notes(which would be distorting/omitting/editing/possibly concealing) as long as I link directly to the original work?\n\nIf not, is there no other option then just posting the link, and hoping people read and dig through it to find the part I found relevant?",
