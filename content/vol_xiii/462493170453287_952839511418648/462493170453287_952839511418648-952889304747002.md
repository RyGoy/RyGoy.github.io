   "message": "This is an excellent question.  Thank you for posting it.\n\nAnyone who has ever attended school, or considered a career in journalism, has been introduced to the concept of plagiarism; and the possible repercussions for not attributing existing works you reproduce, alter, paraphrase, or include (in any way) in your own creations.\n\nAccording to the Creative Commons Corporation (US) article, \"Best practices for attribution\" (https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution#This_is_an_ideal_attribution),\n\n\"You can use CC-licensed materials as long as you follow the license conditions. One condition of all CC licenses is attribution.\"\n\nCorrectly attributing source material is described in detail further down the page, in the section entitled, \"Title, Author, Source, License\".\n\nAnother document, written by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation (www.cci.edu.au) provides informative, illustrated examples of how to use Creative Commons' licensed materials properly.  This information is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Australia licence, and can be found here ==>  http://creativecommons.org.au/materials/attributingccmaterials.pdf.\n\nAn excerpt from this document provides additional details: \n\n\"What to include when attributing\n\nThe same principles apply to providing attribution across all CC licences.  You should:\n\n- credit the creator;\n- provide the title of the work;\n- provide the URL where the work is hosted;\n- indicate the type of license it is available under and provide a link to the licence (so others can find out the licence terms); and\n- keep intact any copyright notice with the work.\n\nThis may sound like a lot of information, but there is flexibility in the way you present it.  With a bit of clever formatting and linking it is easy to include all this information, particularly in the digital environment.\"\n\nIf all your thoughts, ideas, drawings, code, photographs (you get the idea), are completely original, no attribution should be necessary.  Otherwise, anything you produce, especially if it enters the public domain, should include an investigation of how to correctly attribute work originally produced by others.\n\nIn the case of Creative Commons, Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0), license, a description of how materials may be used can be found here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/ which includes:\n\n\"You are free to:\n\n    Share ï¿½ copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\n\n    The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.\"\n\nMake sure you read and understand the terms of use described in: \"Under the following terms:\"\n\nMost commercial works have licensed restrictions relating to their use and distribution; and both commercial and non-commercial works can utilize the Creative Commons licenses (yes, more than one category).  Before using anything originally attributed to another person, business, entity, you should take the time to familiarize yourself with how it is licensed, and if, and how, it can be used.\n\nTL;DR: When using material licensed under Creative Commons, Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported license, quote the information you are using directly, reference the article name (if it exists) and author, and provide a link to the information. In all cases where you can't be bothered to research how to attribute someone else's work -- don't use it, say nothing.",
