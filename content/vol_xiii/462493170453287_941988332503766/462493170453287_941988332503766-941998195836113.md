   "message": "\"The expression �common law� refers to the law developed over the years by judges in deciding court cases. The expression is usually used to distinguish this body of law from �statute law�\" - That, of course is a STATUTORY definition, and NOT what COMMON LAW means as regards RIGHTS. COURTS ARE A STATUTORY BODY!\n\n\" i.e. the law adopted in statutes passed by the Legislature or by Parliament for Canada as a whole. However, statute law prevails over common law, so the Legislature can change the common law by passing legislation.\" - Whenever you touch money, you throw away your common law rights for statutory privilege, is basically what is being said here.",
