   "message": "I smell some bullshit here and notice some weasel phraseology in response to my inquiry as to whether or not Ontario is some common law jurisdiction. I'd appreciate help breaking this apart. \n\nMy intention was to have an \"official\" communique from the Attorney General's office to establish that Ontario is indeed a common law jurisdiction. It seems to raise more questions than it answers. \n\nMy hope here is to put some \"powerful\" questions to him that will either \"force\" him to lie (due to his oath to protect the law society), or, have him admit some facts that may serve me/us in the future.\n\nHere's the response:\n\n****\n\nThank you for your recent inquiry to the Ministry of the Attorney General�s web site about whether Ontario is a common law jurisdiction.  I have been asked to respond on behalf of the Ministry.\n\nIt is accurate to say that Ontario is a common law jurisdiction, that is, a territory with applicable law based in part on the common law.\n\nThe expression �common law� refers to the law developed over the years by judges in deciding court cases. The expression is usually used to distinguish this body of law from �statute law�, i.e. the law adopted in statutes passed by the Legislature or by Parliament for Canada as a whole.  However, statute law prevails over common law, so the Legislature can change the common law by passing legislation.\n\nThe Legislature�s powers are limited by the Constitution both as to the division of legislative powers between the federal and the provincial government, and by individual rights protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nFor example, much of the law about contracts is common law; it arises from court decisions about individual lawsuits that involved contracts.  However, the Legislature has passed the Sale of Goods Act (in the late 19th century) and the Consumer Protection Act (in the mid-20th century) to clarify or to improve the rules about contracts, or to make them more accessible to the general public.\n\nIn most cases a mix of sources of the law will apply to any situation. Legal rules are not more or less valid because they have more or less common law or statutory content.\n\nThe Ministry of the Attorney General publishes several general guides to the law online. General legal information is available at Justice Ontario, the Ministry�s legal information site. To access Justice Ontario, please visit our website at:\n\n www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/justice-ont/\n\n A source of both court decisions and the text of statutes for all of Canada � federal government and the provinces � is www.canlii.org, a product of the Federation of Law Societies.\n\n Once again, thank you for contacting the Ministry. \n\nJohn D. Gregory\nGeneral Counsel\nJustice Policy Development Branch\n\nPolicy and Innovation Division\nMinistry of the Attorney General",
