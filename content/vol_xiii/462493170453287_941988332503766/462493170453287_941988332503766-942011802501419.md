   "message": "Way back in my 'freedumb\" days I recall reading about a hierarchy in law. I'm going back six or seven years so my memory may not serve me, but, as I recall the hierarchy was stated as:\n\n1) The law of nature ( here i am referring to gravity etc.)  \n2) Ecclesiastical Law\n3) Trust Law\n4) Common Law (Law of the land)\n5) Maritime/Admiralty Law (Acts/Statutes/commercial law)  \n\nThis is a good time to establish definitively the truth. Is there a hierarchy in law, and if so what is it?",
