   "message": "Damn.  I amended the restrictions of the Articles of Incorporation for MIMI last month.  It changed from being ' unrestricted'  to being a 'trust holding company' and a 'Public Benefit Corp'. \n\n Today, I received a phone called from the Registry of Companies pertaining to the changes made and that the Director needs clarification on such. \n\nSo, the director has some questions for me about my intentions of having a public benefit corp and wants to know it the corp has a valid license under the Trust and Loan Company Act.  :O\n\nCorrespondence was mailed out March 1 and 'Wrong address, return to sender'  was received by them today.   They did have a typo.  Mini, not Mimi.  I am unsure what happened and am still investigating.",
