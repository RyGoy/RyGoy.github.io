   "message": "Let say CRA demand MONEY.\n\nYou feel it's not right, but you're a complete ignorant.\n\nYou can't give $3k to a lawyer so he can lie to you.\n\nYou come to me, I don't charge you anything, maybe $35 to open a file, which you will claim back from CRA.\n\nSo, after spending an hour with you, teaching you how cooperative you have to be in all this, a \"security for cost\" will be demanded to CRA,  because you have no surety, and CRA have it all :D",
