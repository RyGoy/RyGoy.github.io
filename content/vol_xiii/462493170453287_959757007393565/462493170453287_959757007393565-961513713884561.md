   "message": ":D\n\nI am sure you are more than competent to manage your affairs, Pete Daoust. But if you want to be extra cooperative, Nad's person's AGENT can sure go just to ask questions, and receive answers. And that sure will incur in some costs, the administration of this matter. Cash up front! Or you they may be billed later, all after notice, of course.\n\nNADINE belongs to Pete Daoust. And it's evident that which ever administrator and/or agent you send to this matter, should you choose to do so, it's a matter of TRUST.  Extra cooperation will always end-up in extra-billing, and it's not your fault! Hey, at least NADINE will be cooperating! :D",
