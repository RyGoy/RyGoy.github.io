NONE OF THIS IS HIDDEN! You would rather skulk around as a bottom-feeding slug, selling delusional \"secrets\", than do what I DEMAND, that the truth NOT be restricted.\n\n...but your \"secrets\", aren't the truth, are they?\n\nNotice how I'm JUST as RIGHT as I was these past three years, when you insisted the opposite?",
