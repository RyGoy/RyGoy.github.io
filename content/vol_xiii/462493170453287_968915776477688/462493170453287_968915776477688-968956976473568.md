   "message": "\"The prodigal son\" is a stupid story.\n\nI don't forgive this kind of \"mistake\", because not only do you LIE about me, and what I say, you'll tell others that lie too. Any interaction you've had with the Dean C. Clifford crowd in the past three years, proves that out.\n\nYour \"mistake\", Adam, is the kind that means me harm. You endorsed the views of those who mean me harm, and even now, after pouring 3 years into educating you evil, stupid chimps, you DARE say I omit ANYTHING?\n\nFuck you! Die.",
