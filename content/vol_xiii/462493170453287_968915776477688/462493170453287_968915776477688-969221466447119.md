   "message": "<<My intent is to learn from the most intelligent Man i know.>>\n\nYou know, Adam Thomas, we know you are full of shit. I can provide evidence. \n\nI just quoted you saying Scott Duncan is the most intelligent man you know. Scott flat out told you it's better for your daughter if you are not around. And he is the most intelligent man you know. So, are you going to take Scott on his intelligent suggestion? Or, is his intelligence not good enough on this particular situation?\n\n<< i have realised that a lot of what he taught me has been very true and correct and that i have been wrong>>\n\nA LOT of what Scott has \"taught you\" has been true, and correct. Is that a disclaimer? I guess there is this little bit left out that is not true, and correct?\n\nThese are not the same sentences, nor mean the same:\n\n- << i have realised that A LOT of what he taught me has been very true and correct and that i have been wrong>>\n\n<< i have realised that Scott is ALWAYS right, has been ALWAYS true and correct, and that i have been wrong>>\n\nYour lying pathetic sad story notwithstanding.",
