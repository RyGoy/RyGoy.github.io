   "message": "While all the thinking people have been replacing money and changing the world, The Free-Dumbers and Piece-of-Shit Christians have been trying to build \"nations\", so they might want to look at the OPEN stuff that ACTUAL thought and knowledge produces, because \"faith\" in pretend sky-daddies, and sunday circle-jerks aren't doing it for them!\n\nIn fact I would LOVE it If Dean Clifford's 'Earthsc.com\" adopts it! That way, when he's out in 2019, he can choke on the #ScottIsAlwaysRight. \n\n*Cue Beer Commercial Music*\n\nCool crisp, and all natural, the #ScottIsAlwaysRight we produce here at THE TENDER FOR LAW is just like the #ScottIsAlwaysRight you remember from 2009. Dean can Choke on it like the penis he is surely choking on now.",

   "description": "Pax: An Ethereum Powered Virtual Nation\n\nCryptocurrency is not only changing how we look at money, but its decentralized technology is also transforming other traditional mediums as well. One of these areas of society where things are getting shaken up is the idea of self-governance using blockchain technology as arbitration for law. One platform that is looking to pull this off is Pax, a virtual nation and peer-to-peer legal system powered by Ethereum.\n\n",
