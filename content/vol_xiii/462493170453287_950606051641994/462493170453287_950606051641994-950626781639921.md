   "message": "*sigh* OK, let me walk you through it.\n\nYou get a SIGNED OFFICIAL position that is a LIE.\n\nYou PUBLISH it.\n\nBecause the BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS a security, then LEGALLY, the government is committing FRAUD. They have just OFFICIALLY declared the MOST VALUABLE SECURITY, to be some other type of paper.\n\nWhen SECURITIES are libeled by the government, the SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION can step in. They are pretty toothless against the BANKS, but they can lock up GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS with a rubber stamp and a signature!\n\nThey would be arrested by the FBI. In order for them to understand why the warrant be issued, you kind of have to be candid about what it REALLY is.\n\n...all of it is on the public record.\n\nNOBODY wants that.\n\nI have the SEC on speed-dial for just such an occasion. ;)\n\nGetting an official to lie in writing, is GOLD.\n\nBe sure to tell the TRUTH. \n\nInform him you intend to publish the letter to debunk the \"Sovereign Citizens\" <---Tell him THAT. He'll love that!\n\nTell him that you will hold him PERSONALLY liable for inaccurate information. :D",
