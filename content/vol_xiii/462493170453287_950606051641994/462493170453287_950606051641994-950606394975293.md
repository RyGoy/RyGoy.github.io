So I am clear, this also would mean that the Birth Certificate is NOT a security, correct?\n\n2. Why do you hold the original? And may I have the original?\n\n...if it's mine, I should be able to have it, right?\n\nThanks, \nChris\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nDiMartino, Dean (DPH) <dean.dimartino@state.ma.us>\nFeb 25 (2 days ago)\n\nto me \nCorrect, a birth certificate is not a security.\n \nThe Registry retains the original record because we are required by Massachusetts General Law to do so.",
