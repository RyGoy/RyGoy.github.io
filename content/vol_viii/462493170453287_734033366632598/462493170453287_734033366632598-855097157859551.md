   "message": "Chris Evan, I have read about the UCC-1 financial statement (but still not comprehend). I went to the office (that you linked), and got the form. They adviced for a lawyer, and/or accountant to fill the form. I have read things like \"security agreement\" in the Internet. Other than that, I am missing everything. This is all hear say stuff. \n\nFor example, I understand the Notice of Mistake, WHY it works,  HOW to do it, and how to stand in the questions asked. But for the lien I am missing all that. Is like having the printed Notice of Mistake (UCC-1), but having no clue why it works, and how to proceed.\n\nWhere can I go learn, when the government is not going to answer, other that \"get  a lawyer\"? That is why I asked the question to Admiral Scott Duncan.",
