Here, in Canada, a debt needs to be DISCHARGED. I can prove it.\n\n3. Here, in Canada, a Bill of Exchange = LEGAL Money. I can prove it.\n\n4. I have sent a Bill of Exchange to DISCHARGE that debt. I can prove that they have received it. And they are HOLDING this BoE as we speak.\n\n5. They still want to collect on that debt.\n\n6. They seems to REFUSE the discharge, but never made mention of it.\n\n7. I want that LEGAL MONEY back if it�s the case, and then I WILL PAY.\n\n8. If they keep that LEGAL MONEY, and push their bullshit still, they are nothing more than CRIMINALS, and I will be able to prove it.\n\n9. The End.\n\nCan you hold your ground on this ? :D",
