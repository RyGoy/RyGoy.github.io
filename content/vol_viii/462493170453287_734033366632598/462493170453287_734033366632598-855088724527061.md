   "message": "Ok, Admiral Scott, I know a lien in commerce puts you first in line. Seizing the equity. I see the big picture, surety and accounting, but someone like me is missing all the technical aspects of how to properly navigate in commerce to accomplish this. \n\nWhat does one do to place a lien? What is necessary? What papers, and how to fill out the paperwork with out screwing something up? If I do not know any of this, do I have even any business attempting something this? :/ Where can I go to learn what to do? \n\nI have some answers, but not all. And I do think I must not attempt to do anything I do not fully understand.",
