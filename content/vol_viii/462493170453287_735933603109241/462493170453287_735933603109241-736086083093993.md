   "message": "they don`t print the money we currently use its done in Australia ..I hate Gov`t and everything it stands for hate the laws and do my best to stink up every interaction i have with them . When has Gov`t ever allowed themselves to be left out in the cold they do not do any thing at the job i work at yet feel obligated in making my wallet lighter every week   Its an opportunity to generate revenue they will make any one with a business license comply or put them out of business and revoke that permission",
