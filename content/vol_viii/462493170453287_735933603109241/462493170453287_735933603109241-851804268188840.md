   "message": "It doesn't MATTER what you think. It doesn't matter what you FEEL. It doesn't matter what you BELIEVE. I'LL STILL be right! \n\nIt doesn't matter WHAT uninformed idiots you have read. I'm STILL RIGHT.\n\nHere's the ugly reality: YOU ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO SPEAK ON THESE MATTERS.\n\nYou are not qualified to have OPINION on these matters.\n\nIf you were, you wouldn't be here. In 2016 I will be hunting the \"cherry-pickers. These are the people Like Rick Hiltz, who think they can squeeze other people's bullshit in with my REAL TRUTH. \n\nLet this be a lesson here, TO ALL of you. Dissenting \"opinions\" WILL be used against you at a later date, and I DEEM \"SO BE IT\" to be permission to do whatever I see fit, to rub your arrogant presumption that you may be right, in your face.\n\nYou don't get to walk away with \"so be it\". You said I was WRONG, and you lead others to believe it. You just shifted to \"piece-of-shit christian\" grade.\n\nDoubting me is something permissible 3 years ago...\n\n...not now. I simply won't put up with it anymore. I have spent a LIFETIME on this, whereas all of you have \"searched google\".\n\n\"...Scott I read most of what you put up But I also read other stuff \"?\n\nFUCK YOU!",
