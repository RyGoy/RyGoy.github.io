   "message": "I thought that Scott dealt with this already. Nothing has been \"stolen\" from you. YOU contacted Rogers and requested a service from them. YOU signed a CONTRACT with Rogers, agreeing to pay a monthly fee for the service requested, which they will in turn provide. YOU did not pay your bills, and therefore, YOU broke the CONTRACT. Of course they terminated your service, they have every right to. \n\nMoral of the story? If you CAN'T pay your fucking bills, don't sign up for shit in the first place. International Law states that access to the internet is a HUMAN RIGHT. If you want to reap the benefits      of that law, move to Norway or Finland. In Canada, however, you signed a fucking contract and agreed to pay for it.",
