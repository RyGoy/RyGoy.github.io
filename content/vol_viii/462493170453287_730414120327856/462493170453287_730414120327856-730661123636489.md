   "message": "I have had like 5 times of \"revelation\" moments  about how incredible the blockchain  technology really is. It's like waves of  new levels of comprehention that, like mining, takes some time to figure the problem, and then another wave comes in. Everytime I find more reasons in every new \"revelation.\"\n\nI imagine there is only a few people in the planet that actually get how the blockchain technology will change humanity forever. How awesome, literaly, it is. Somewhat like many see Sir Isacc  Newton now, that is how \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" will be seen years from now.",
