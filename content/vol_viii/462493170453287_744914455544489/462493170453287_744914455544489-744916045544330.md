   "message": "Exclusive - The Quebec Bar has opened an investigation into the lawyer of one of the leaders of the sovereign citizens movement. These supporters argue that they do not have to pay taxes because the governments, courts and laws are illegal.\n\nJacques-Antoine Normandin, one of Quebec's most famous sovereign citizens movement figures , was convicted of criminal failure to file his tax returns.\n\nHis lawyer, Michel Le Brun, filed the appeal.\n\nIn an interview last June, it held that the Quebec courts are illegal.\n\n\"We appealed because we believe that the judge is a judge of the Court of Quebec, is not constitutionally based,\" he argued.\n\nThis is in response to the remarks that the Barreau du Quï¿½bec has opened an investigation.\n\nIn a letter, which we HAVE obtained a copy, the trustee of the Society asked Mr Le Brun to explain.\n\nAccording to the Code of Conduct, a lawyer should support the authority of the courts and have the requisite skill to defend his client.",
