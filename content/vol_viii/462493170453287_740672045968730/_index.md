   "message": "Time to play \"Let's ask questions\" with Capitaine Pete :D When I spoke to the MASTER of questions a couple months ago Pete wished he could do this again for his kids because he would take a very different approach. He would have lots of quesions to ask the government . A few members of the TTFL now have new babies so I think doing this right is an important undertaking so our kids, using Pete's words, will be \"fucking powerful!\" \n\nI received these in the mail this week...first from the Ministry of Health, who got the \"Child's Date of Birth\" wrong, and then from the Office of the Registrar General (which is in the Ministry of Government Services). So how does the government know a baby was born? Well the midwife INFORMED them. \n\nApparently the VITAL STATISTICS ACT \"requires\" a man/woman to register his/her child (LEGAL term) within 30 days of the DATE OF BIRTH (ADMIRALTY term) lol! Notice that it says \"You can't get a birth certificate for this child until the birth is registered\" :( According to the midwifery clinic the birth was registered by them. Apparently there are two parts, they did the first part. \n\nSo as Captain Pete wisely suggests I'm not saying that I won't register my little girl, but before I do I have some very important questions that I require the REGISTRAR GENERAL to answer first. So what questions would you be asking folks? :D",
