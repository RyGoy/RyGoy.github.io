   "message": "Ha! I have a question Capitaine Pete :D \n\nDear Registrar General,\n\nThis letter you sent to the PERSON says that the VITAL STATISTICS ACT requires the person to register the birth of their child within 30 days. \n\nI think there has been a mistake as the PERSON named did not give birth to a child. A baby girl was borne by a woman though and I am wondering why this is any of your business. If this baby girl is the reason for your letter then I require further clarification from you. \n\nIf a man and woman do not wish to register the fact that the baby they created was born, are they forbidden from creating and then having a baby together?\n\nBy: Sole Authorized Administrator for the PERSON",
