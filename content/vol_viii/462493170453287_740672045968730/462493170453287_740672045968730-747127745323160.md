   "message": "<<I still want to know how they can compel a man to do anything if he is not a slave...>>\n\nI have an answer. You have a few semi-evolved chimps, and a whole bunch of zombiefied semi-evolved chimps. A few semi-evolved chimps give guns, and a fat check to very few zombiefied semi-evolved chimps. In turn, very few zombiefied semi-evolved chimps force the rest of the zombiefied semi-evolved chimps to \"comply.\" The end!",
