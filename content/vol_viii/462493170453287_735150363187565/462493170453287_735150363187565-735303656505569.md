   "message": "Will Bed, there are no synonyms, nor homonyms in LAW. I think your confusion lies in the definitions of the words. The definition of the words INCOME, and DEPOSIT cannot be the same. You have not heard of the \"DEPOSIT Tax Act,\" but perhaps the \"INCOME Tax Act.\" \n\nHaving said that, in LEGAL world, INCOME is TAXABLE, DEPOSITS are NOT taxable. DEPOSITS are HELD in TRUST. But you may still withdraw funds AFTER being DEPOSITED, by way of ATM, as Chris has mentioned.\n\nScott has mentioned one may write \"FOR DEPOSIT ONLY\" in the instruments. NOT only for tax purposes, but also that way you avoid acting as SURETY for that INSTRUMENT, by NOT placing your signature.",
