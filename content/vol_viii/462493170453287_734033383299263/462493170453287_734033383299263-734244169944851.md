   "message": "Right, here's the summons... It's text is a bit weak but is eligible. \n\n1. MICHAEL P GIBLIN clocked the car and sent the details to PAT COSTELLO in the penalty processing office.\n\n2. He issued the notice to EAMONN O BRIEN.\n\n3. I responded with a Notice of Mistake.\n\n4. PAT replied wishing to acknowledge receipt of my notice and did not  answer any of the questions put to him therein.\n\n5. I acknowledged his acceptance of my position as a party without surety and completed the bill of exchange and returned it.\n\nSometime afterwards Pat has failed to present it to THE CENTRAL BANK for discharge and the books therefore remain unbalanced. MICHAEL P GIBLIN therefore has sought to summon EAMONN O BRIEN  to settle the matter.\n\nSo, my thoughts are that, MICHAEL P GIBLIN needs to be notified that  payment was offered to a PAT COSTELLO and that there seems to be a discrepancy in their accounting.\n\nI'll forward all the paperwork to GIBLIN showing him that I have attempted to settle this matter in good faith and that the matter is considered closed.\n\nIf he wishes for me to attend any administrative hearings then he will be billed for my time...\n\nHow does that all sound? :D",
