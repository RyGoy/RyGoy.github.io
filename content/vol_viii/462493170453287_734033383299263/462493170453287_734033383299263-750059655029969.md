   "message": "Here's my first draft affidavit for the court file. I wanna make sure I'm as prepared as possible. I'll attach the relevant documents as the exhibits and have the affidavit witnessed by a commissioner of oaths. \n\nI understand everyone has busy lives and my small problem here is next to irrelevant but if anyone can find the time to point out where I might be going wrong, if at all :p, so I'm not showing up on the day with my dick in my hand that'd be a great help. \n\nIf I am successful with having the case dismissed it could cement what I've been trying to teach people here in Ireland and could really get them listening...\n\nCheers guys. Hope people don't mind me tagging them...\n\nScott, Ceit, Pete, Chris, anyone who's been to court! :p",
