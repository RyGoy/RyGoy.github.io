   "message": "\"Eamonn O Brien: I'll be honest, the fear of being railroaded and made an example of is quite prominent... The meeting is set for a Friday morning and I can foresee the Justice ordering the ignorant cronies to take me away for the weekend...\"\nThat is the only thing they have going for them Eamonn. Instilling that thought into you is prominent for them. Most will give in knowing that they will be able to go home if they pay.\nEamonn wrote, \"Or, they might see that I'm a bit more educated than the average freeman, under god, claiming constitutional rights etc and throw the whole thing out...\"\nI'm sure that they will see an educated man looking for the surety.\nIf it was me, Eamonn, I would not carry any identification on me.\n\"PLEASE BRING YOUR LICENSE WITH YOU ON THE DAY AND A COPY FOR THE COURT RECORDS\"\nAuuh, excuse me, but fuck you and the surety you rode in on!\nAgain, this is me, I can defend this action in my way with my temper and attitude.\n\"Who the fuck are you and where is the surety?\"\n\"Who the fuck has a claim against me?\"",
