   "message": "So this is the final draft of the letter I'm going to send along with the invoice... \n\nIt's my first time dealing with a summons since joining the group so I want to make sure I've done everything correctly as it could serve as a  means for teaching others here in Ireland...\n\nI'll also send paperwork to the court file notifying them of the current situation...\n\nScott, Pete, Ceit... Cheers for your time...",
