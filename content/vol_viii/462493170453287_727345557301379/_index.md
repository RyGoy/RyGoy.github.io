   "message": "What if someone in my family got her �PERSON� stolen and/or used FRAUDULENTLY? \nWe found out it was going on only because a credit check (Equifax) was made, and that is 2 years ago so we can sign a lease. \nOn the Equifax report, most of employment of her career were not on the record, instead unrelated one were written, we assumed they are the employments of the fraudulent user living on her \"PERSON\". On top of this, it seem like the fraud was ongoing, because some contracted loans were in good standing with the credits with the banks, to the exception of a few REALLY neglected loans. A mortgage was in good standing, a car loan too.\n\nTo this point, there is a big status-quot, no news from no one and no research made to know where the case is it. For many reason, one of which is the bank's investigation is �on its way� and there is no information given out. Secondly, because it�s a stressful topic it physically hard to bring the facts up without really sever anxiety striking and at this point, her health does not allow anymore stress.\n\nI sometime suggest taking the bull by the horn to make sure there is no blow back in the future, if the banks try to identify her as PERSON on action she did not take. \n\nI see its important to be sole ADMINISTRATOR of the PERSON and that requires BEING and ADMINISTRATOR in GOOD FAITH. The fraud started long time ago, when the she was a minor living at her parents and was ongoing since only recently (2 years ago). The bank has only once gave sign of the case moving forward, by calling and giving a court date for her to appear as a witness. Then the date was postponed and since than, no news at all, that was last September, 2013. \n\nThe lawful owner of the person has no access using her name to anything, buying property or anything at all.\nWhat do you guys think of all this?\n\nIs there any significant action I can take has the HUSBAND of the woman that was stolen her PERSON.\n \n*Edited some Frenglish*",
