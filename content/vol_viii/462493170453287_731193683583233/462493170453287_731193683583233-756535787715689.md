   "message": "Happy Independence Day today, 6th December..\nO, Finland, behold, your day is dawning,\nThe threat of night has been banished away,\nAnd the lark of morning in the brightness sings,\nAs though the very firmament would sing.\nThe powers of the night are vanquished by the morning light,\nYour day is dawning, O land of birth.\nO, rise, Finland, raise up high\nYour head, wreathed with great memories.\nO, rise, Finland, you showed to the world\nThat you drove away the slavery,\nAnd that you did not bend under oppression,\nYour day is dawning, O land of birth.",
