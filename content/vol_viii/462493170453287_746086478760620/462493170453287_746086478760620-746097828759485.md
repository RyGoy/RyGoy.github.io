   "message": "No, when a debt is \"sent\" to collections, it means they've sold it. The collections people have purchased that debt from Telus. Thing is, you never signed anything stating that you agreed to pay this third-party company. They use threats and intimidation to bully people into paying, because they are aware that you don't actually have any obligation to them. \n\nTell them to produce the contract, and you'll happily resolve this issue.",
