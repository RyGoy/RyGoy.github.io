   "message": "Hi everyone,\nOn April 19th, LIAM VILLEMAIRE�s cellphone was stolen in Nicaragua. The bill was raised to 3,800$.\nOn May 14th, I came back.\nOn May 19th I Spoke with a Telus agent when Internet became operational at my new apartment.\nMay 22th, Telus reduced the debt to $ 1,900 because they are UNDERSTANDABLE.\nI will avoid all the unecessary details that happen through May and September considering that it�s useless for you� \nI asked in Aug. 15th to an agent to send me a detailed INVOICE. He told me �perfect� and \"changed the account address for the new one.\"\nOn September 15th, I didn�t receive anything and the girl from customer service told me that it was leaving that day and that it would take 10 working days.\n2 weeks later I did not receive it and they told me that it was because they sent it to the wrong place. He sent me another one and I received it on October 18th. With this bill I wrote my letter to Telus and completed, with good faith, the bill of exchange.\nOn October 20th, I received a letter from a collection agency informing me that the account had been transferred to them.\nI have no experience with this kind of situation, someone has an idea?\nShould I give the bill of exchange duly completed to the collection agency because Telus says I have to go through them?\nDo I have to deal with Telus because LIAM VILLEMAIRE has no contract with the collection agency?\nDo I cry in a corner ?? :P\nThank you in advance !!",
