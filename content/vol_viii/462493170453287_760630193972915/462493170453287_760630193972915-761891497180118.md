   "message": "Daniel J Wentz He wrote it. It's his. I just said Roguesupport is the Copyholder. Keep your lies straight. \nDaniel J Wentz No you don't liar. In fact if there is an account left on the group that hasn't come here to declare what a sack of shit you are, they are purged from the group.\n\nStuart Stone Scott has never come across to me as weak...again, your bias/beliefs may be clouding your own perceptions.\nDo I 'need' to defend him? ...See More\n\nDan Wilson Okay well I made my point a while back. Have a good night, guys.\n\nDaniel J Wentz Wow... what kind of psycho claims something is \"worthless freeman stuff\" and makes multiple accounts? You do know that is the act of a psychopath, right?\nLiar or Psychopath. Those are the only things people will see at this point. You should have listened to your handler and signed off \n\nDaniel J Wentz You LIED a while back. Is that what you are referring to?\n\nDaniel J Wentz OOPS, the handler is mad!\n\nStuart Stone I think you're reading too much into it all Daniel J Wentz, 'wannabe' was the term that sprung to my mind.\n\nDan Wilson has repeatedly sidestepped making any point in this entire thread...that takes a degree of skill....See More\n\nDaniel J Wentz I think what little exposure to Scott Duncan you have is more than enough to convince you that he know how to handle hot psycho girls. \nThis is a government worker. I've dealt with far too many of their ilk in my day. I recognize their stench the second they speak up.\n\nDaniel J Wentz This is a common Police tactic. Christian cults do it too.\n\nNotice he claims to have \"given his position\" (Which appears to consist of doing nothing but lie about Scott Duncan), and you are to \"stupid\" and \"ignorant\" to see it. But he \"cares\" and \"feels sorry\" for us....See More\n\nDaniel J Wentz I'm not \"reading too much\" into it. This psycho has been obsessed with Scott Duncan, and he does nothing but lie about Scott Duncan. That's not \"wannabe\" behavior. That's psychopathic behavior or government behavior. Nothing else.\n\nStuart Stone Noted, thanks\n\nMackximus Minimus Fuck off, \"Dan Wilson\". I knew you were a lying scum bag agent from \"god's little helpers\" from day one, and I called you out. That is why you blocked me, you piece-of-shit. It seems you are pissing off the wrong crowd. You clearly come out as a liar, ...See More\n\nAdrian Thomson \"Best practices for attribution \nYou can use CC-licensed materials as long as you follow the license conditions.

PS way to support the system, Scott! Tell us more about the Crown laws of notice, trusts, contracts, liens, surety and everything else you didn't create but think you have a right to use and control! \n\nWill Jefferson The \"Law of Paper\", really.  Its seems Dan also wants you to believe the crown invented the concept of giving notice. You're transparent as fuck Dan, are you even trying?\n\nSteven P. Nuxoll Point taken Adrian Thomson, Had I realized how sensitive people were and their inability to see that I merely copied and pasted a portion to highlight the main point of the content shared I would have made it abundantly clear to those who cannot discern what I thought most could figure out. I'll make the necessary edit to clarify for those who had any confusion.\n\nAdrian Thomson It looked to me Steven that it all stemmed from that, so I linked to the Creative Commons site as reference. It was not so much about making a point, but to clarify the error.\nCheers\n\nAdrian Thomson Dan Wilson, where do you get the idea that I am here to do your bidding? If you have something to say to Scott, send him a message yourself.\n\nSteven P. Nuxoll Cheers \n\nDavid T Godby Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups. however, never underestimate the power of one small group of hackers to turn off all their technology and leave them begging for it back.\n\nJames Baal This isn't about who wrote what this is about responsibility YOU are not able to apply necessary guidance YOU are doing damage.

It was quite poignant. idgaf, it's useful. Fearful assholes will always try to argue with semantics, never understanding the base point is that we are ALL citizens caste into the slave system, unless the person reading this is ...See More\n\nDavid T Godby Realize also, US law is still under the BAR (British) system. You can easily walk into open court, demand to see the victim in your case, if the 'victim' is the state then there is no victim as the state is not a person and then move to dismiss the magistrate. There is no victim, there is no crime, at that point you can move to dismiss your own case and that's that.\n\nDan Wilson Will, Yes, exactly. According to every court in the land, Crown law is all that matters. The Crown BROUGHT the laws of notice, contract, trust, etc. to the land. Using them means you submit to the Crown. You cannot USURP the Crown using law because THEY CREATED IT and therefore THEY CONTROL IT. Why is that so hard?\n\nDan Wilson Adrian, Since you didn't seem to pick up on it, my request was more rhetorical and sarcastic than anything. I know better than to have expectations of you as a competent messenger for your \"Admiral\". My point still stands. WHAT gives SCOTT or anyone the RIGHT to USE and gain ADVANTAGE via LAW THEY DID NOT CREATE free of control of the creators of said law? It's easy for anyone with any sense to comprehend the mistake. IT'S NOT YOUR LAW. Where is Scott on this issue? Hiding. Ignorant.\n\nAdrian Thomson Dan, Your request was neither rhetorical nor sarcastic. It was an ORDER, and sice you insist on bringing it back up my response to ORDERS from strangers is FUCK OFF!\nYou then made an attack on Scott with one sentence and a request of him in the next sentence.\n\nAdrian Thomson From comments like that, it is hard for other readers to know if you are coming or going. How can they take your words seriously?",
