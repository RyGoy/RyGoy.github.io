   "message": "No. He's trying to get you to do NOTHING and \"walk away\". This allows them to rule summarily against you. The Liening of the name gives you complete control, and the banks/government gets NOTHING.\n\n...as it should be. YOU are the only one who paid for that name. Every transaction you've done in that name is something YOU did. NOBODY ELSE CONTRIBUTED A CENT TO THAT NAME. NOBODY. Demand your money back, plus interest, plus punitive damages for non-disclosure. They can have the name back when they pay what they owe.\n\nTHIS is why Dan Wilson is trying to convince you that i'm wrong. He's Government and means you harm. You learn too much here.",
