   "message": "Fucking landlord just entered my residence without notice. This is a serious problem. I know he did not snoop around as it was a water emergency but for fuck sakes they have my phone number and know I do not tolerate violations to our agreement. I just informed him that as the beneficiary of a trust ( it pays the rent each month) I must report this incident to the trustee and I'm not sure if he will get a warning notice or an invoice for breach of trust. They are now in a panic, they brought me a litre of wine and begged that I not report them to the trust. Do I give up this sweet spot, not sure, I just moved here (I hate moving). do I send a shot across the bow with a warning notice and fee's in the event they breach the trust again. I am livid!",
