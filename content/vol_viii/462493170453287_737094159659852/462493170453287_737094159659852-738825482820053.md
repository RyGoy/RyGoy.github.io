   "message": "Scott Duncan \n\nWhat about claims that Postal Money Orders are backed by gold under the UPU?  So far I've heard \"French Gold..UPU...or something...\" in this thread.\n\nI was HOPING to have my intelligence belittled in a manner informing me of the underlying concepts, for example:\n\n\"The UPU does not back Postal Money Orders, you idiot..\"\n\"UPU is a multilateral agreement for transportation of mailpieces and thus not the type of entity that backs ANYTHING by gold you fucking moron\"",
