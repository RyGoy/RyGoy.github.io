   "message": "I do not think most here know what Scott means when he says \"Computer Science.\" I \"believed\" it had to do COMPUTERS, but now I know better, because Scott gave away the answer. (Yes, I have no original thought, :/ )\n\n\"Computer Science has nothing to do with computers!\" (I am paraphrasing) Admiral Scott mentioned here a few times. So off I went to find out what did he meant with that. Especially after knowing that COMPUTER SCIENCE WILL REPLACE GOVERNMENT. Humm...\n\n<<The history of computer science began long before the modern discipline of computer science that emerged in the 20th century, and hinted at in the centuries prior...\n\nThe earliest known tool for use in COMPUTATION was the abacus, developed in period 2700ï¿½2300 BCE in Sumer .[citation needed] The Sumerians' abacus consisted of a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system.[2] Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles .[citation needed] Abaci of a more modern design are still used as CALCULATION TOOLS today...\n\nIn 1837 Charles Babbage first described his Analytical Engine which is accepted as the first design for a modern computer.  The analytical engine had expandable memory, an arithmetic unit, and \nlogic processing capabilities able to interpret a programming language with loops and conditional branching. Although never built, the design has been studied extensively and is understood to be Turing equivalent. The analytical engine would have had a memory capacity of less than 1 kilobyte of memory and a clock speed of less than 10 Hertz .\nConsiderable advancement in mathematics and electronics theory was required before the first modern computers could be designed...\n\nIn 1703, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz developed logic in a formal, mathematical sense with his writings on the binary numeral system. In his system, the ones and zeros also represent TRUE and FALSE VALUES or ON and OFF states. But it took more than a century before George Boole published his Boolean algebra in 1854 with a complete system that allowed computational processes to be mathematically modeled .[citation needed]\nBy this time, the first mechanical devices driven by a binary pattern had been invented. The industrial revolution had driven forward the mechanization of many tasks, and this included weaving. Punched cards controlled Joseph Marie Jacquard's loom in 1801, where a hole punched in the card indicated a binary one and an unpunched spot indicated a binary zero. Jacquard's loom was far from being a computer, but it did illustrate that machines could be driven by binary systems .>>\n\nAnything that helps us make calculations, computations, interpret, develop stuff, is Computer Science. So, by definition of COMPUTER, even HUMANS are COMPUTERS. And by the definition of Computer Science, the blockchain technology is a perfect example of advanced Computer Science.\n\nLook at how much stuff many of us humans have been ignoring! :/ These nobles have been working on this stuff for centuries. Now all of us who have ignored reality, eat Chef Boyardee for dinner.",
