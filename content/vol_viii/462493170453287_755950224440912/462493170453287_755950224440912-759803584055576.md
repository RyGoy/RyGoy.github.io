   "message": ":D\n\n �It really strikes the balance between civil liberties and personal safety and security,� said Naqvi, noting, in 2011, McMurtry urged that any new legislation focus on security at courthouses, nuclear facilities and other large electricity-generating stations. \n\n:D THIS PARAGRAPH! :D\n\n\"For your Safety\" - Isn't that nice :/\n\n\"focus on security at courthouses, nuclear facilities and other large electricity-generating stations\" - Notice that \"Courthouses\" come AHEAD of electricity, and nukes...\n\n...courthouses. Terrorists only attack courthouses when they make it \"legal\" to hurt people for imaginary things. EVER. \n\nA terrorist may blow up a nuke plant or power grid to cripple you... What does blowing up a courthouse do except create marshal law? THINK about it. The more \"security\" you have at a \"courthouse\" the more people the \"terrorist\" is killing. Some of which ARE SECURITY.\n\nNow you have Marshal Law, and the terrorists win. They aren't afraid of \"terrorists\". They're afraid of YOU. Why is that? :D",
