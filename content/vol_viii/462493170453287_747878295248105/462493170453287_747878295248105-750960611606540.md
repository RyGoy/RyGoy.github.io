   "message": "Re:\"Admiral is there anything you don't Know\" - Far too much. I'm enraged at the injustice of having such a short time to be alive, because it means I can NEVER know as much as I want to.\n\n...and there is SO much I don't know. So I study reality. I learn what is TRUE, so I can change the conditions of the test. I don't want to be immortal through my works. I want to become immortal through NOT DYING!\n\nI have supercomputers that have never existed in all of history.\n\nI have a map of my OWN GENOME! I CAN READ IT! I actually stand a fighting chance of making death an OPTION.\n\n...and these things have NEVER existed before. These things were NOT POSSIBLE before. What is possible NOW, strains my mind to its limits! What is yet to come?\n\nI cannot know MOST of all there is to know, but I can fight to be sure of what I do. That's what allows me to leverage what is to come.\n\nI know NOTHING, in the grand scheme of things. I simply know more than YOU. :P",
