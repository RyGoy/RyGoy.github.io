   "message": "\"We see that money is the mathematics of value exchanged based on mutual agreement. The monetary instrument is but the evidence of the consummated trade. It is a mistake to attribute purchasing power to the instrument, for it has none. It is merely the conduit through which purchasing power flows; such purchasing power lying in the commodities or values exchanged. From this analysis we can deduce that commercial banks do not \"lend\" money. They, in fact, permit the \"borrower\" to issue money. Once given permission, the borrower now has the legal authorization to write cheques to the extent of the loan and tender them in trade. UPON THEIR ACCEPTANCE BY A SELLER, WHO IN FACT PROVIDES VALUE, new money has come into existence. This money remains in circulation until such time as the borrower, through becoming a seller, recaptures money with which to liquidate the loan.\"\n\nexcerpt from....\nMONETARY THEORY OF E.C. RIEGEL  by Christopher M. Quigley, B.Sc., M.M.I.I., M.A.\nMarch 6, 2007\n\nSo in Making your own BANK/MONEY, it is critical that you can sell your value back out.... Otherwise, as Scott points out, you starve, because the money that you create becomes worthless.",
