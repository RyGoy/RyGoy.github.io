   "message": "Just remember this:\nWho the fuck are you?\nWhere is the surety?\nI demand that all parties be present, where is the principal?\nAre you trying to esculate this?\nExcuse me for one moment please, I have to call Scott Duncan!\n\nIt was funny. When I was arrested in court, they took all the papers and went through them. I had a printed paper with some Scottism's and the name Scott Duncan was prominent on two printed pages.\nThe cop wanted to take me, but the prosecutor was very adamant in  wanting me out of the building and set free. \nI like to think of it as my skills, but maybe, just maybe, that name on those printed papers played more to the fears than I realize.",
