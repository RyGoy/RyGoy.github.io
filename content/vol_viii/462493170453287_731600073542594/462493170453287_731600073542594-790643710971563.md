   "message": "You actually wanted to kill someone because of \"hurt feelings\".\n\nYou actually try to imply that I endorse that.\n\nHe're something I've said, and will say again and again; You have NO BUSINESS having ANYTHING to do with a child's upbringing. Your contribution to that child was the biological equal of \"sneezing inside her\".\n\nI don't get to demand \"half\" of what the people who built companies/products off my work, because THEY DID ALL THE HARD WORK. THEY took the risk. THEY laboured. THEY made what I thought, INTO REALITY. I \"sneezed\" an idea at them. They brought it to life. They are grateful, but that is all the obligation they really have.\n\nYOU did not give birth to that child. YOU did not carry that child. YOU left semen inside her; The end.\n\n...and for that, you think she should die?\n\nTHIS. THIS is why I get to think/behave like I'm better than you... THIS. Study it carefully. It's PROOF that I am in EVERY MEASURABLE WAY, BETTER THAN YOU.",
