   "message": "In the video when the judge says that \"you are either him or HIS AGENT...\" it is after saying the agent's name (THE name)... Obviously he's not going to say the name of the principal. So if the name is the agent's name how could \"Keith\" be agent for it (an agent)?Or am I just complicating things now? :p",
