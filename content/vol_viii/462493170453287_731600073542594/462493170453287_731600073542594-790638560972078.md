   "message": "Why do you think that is the same as someone trying to kidnap you?\n\nI endorse lethal force against those attempting to kidnap ANYONE; I don't care what magic costume they may be wearing.\n\nYou want to kill someone because they used LEGAL PROCESS (Commerce). Children are not PROPERTY, but BOTH of you did it of your own free will. Nobody's life or liberty is in jeopardy in the pathetic self-constructed delusional hell that is your life, Derek Hill.\n\nThe fact that you think we share the same views on lethal force is just offensive. You don't kill people over hurt feelings. If you want people who think that's ok, become Piece-of-Shit Muslim.",
