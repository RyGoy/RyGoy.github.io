   "message": "The kind that have SUCCESSFUL REWARDING relationships, where we don't have to publically acknowledge that our choice of mate was a lot on the loser side.\n\nWe're the kind that remember that even if the relationship failed, there was something that brought us together and we CERTAINLY are the kind that would never bring a life into the world, with somebody we knew wasn't for the long-term.\n\nWe're the kind who know more, think more, do more, and actually know what love is.\n\n...Who are we to \"judge\"?\n\nBETTER THAN YOU. THAT'S WHY YOU CAME HERE!",
