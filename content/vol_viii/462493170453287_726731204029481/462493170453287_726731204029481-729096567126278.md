   "message": "The STATEMENT declares that the child is of \"UNKNOWN PARENTAGE\".\n\nI've been thinking about this comment from Admiral Scott and sifting and sorting through the Free-duuuumb bullshit I have previously seen trying to connect the dots. \n\nThis comment seems to confirm that the birth registration abandons the child. I am wondering if it is TRUE that under ADMIRALTY/MARITIME SALVAGE Laws once the child is considered abandoned cargo that there is a limited amount of time (was it 7 years) to lay claim to the cargo? Or is this fucking remnants of some Free-duuuuumb bullshit that needs to be suctioned from my brain?",
