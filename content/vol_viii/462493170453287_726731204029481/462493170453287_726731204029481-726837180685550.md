   "message": "OK, here is what you do:\n\n1) READ AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SIGNING.\n\n2) TAKE A LESSON FROM ChiefRock Sino General! See the word UNKNOWN, change it to KNOWN (Red ink: Red LEGALLY means there is a ERROR and it needs CORRECTING) and YOU set the terms. THEN sign it.\n\nHOWEVER: In Ontario (and probably the whole country) they slip it in through DEFINITIONS, making redaction problematic.\n\nAccording to my experts, the DEFINITION of \"PLACE OF BIRTH\" is where they do the \"unknown\" thing, and that's in their DEFINITIONS. Good luck finding it. \n\nThe BRITISH COMMONWEALTH has all of these forms standardized.\n\nLook in OTHER commonwealth jurisdictions for definitions.\n\nAND DON\"T FORGET, YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTION OF RESCINDING YOUR SIGNATURE UNDER THE LEGAL PRINCIPLE OF \"MISTAKE\". (Hence \"Notice of Mistake\")\n\nCourts will ONLY recognize MISTAKE and FRAUD as a remedy. Remember that.\n\nNobody will question \"Place of Birth\", which is why they can \"redefine\" it in some obscure commonwealth tome. It's THEIR LANGUAGE. THEIR RULES, and YOU CAN NEVER understand what they write on their forms. It's just that you \"believe\" you know what the words mean on that form.",
