Can YOU MAKE THAT CLAIM?\n\nI CHERISH THE TIME I SPEND WITH THOSE WHO DEEMED THEIR TIME WORTHY OF ME! I DO NOT SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT EXES. EVER. CAN YOU MAKE THAT CLAIM?\n\nI ACTUALLY READ WHAT I SIGN, AND DON'T SELL CHILDREN FOR COMMERCIAL INTERESTS, AND DECLARE THE CHILD IS OF \"UNKNOWN PARENTAGE\". CAN YOU MAKE THAT CLAIM?\n\nI DON'T CONSIDER CHILDREN \"PROPERTY\". You CAN'T make that claim, Ms. \"MY DAUGHTER\"...\n\n...so if I present the offensive position, that I am BETTER than you...\n\n...IT'S BECAUSE I'M BETTER THAN YOU!\n\nAny questions? :D",
