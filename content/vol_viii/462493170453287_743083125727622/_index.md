   "message": "Whilst writing in another post I mentioned that Australia has no Bill of Rights/Charter of Human Rights or any such instrument as other countries have. \n\nIt seems, in Canadia (<--See our Prime Minister for that), you guys can point to a body of words that specifically mention Security of Person or similar which appears to send Government into a panic.\n\nOver here we have no such thing. As such, the result I have with my local council is the Mayor effectively saying she has no idea what the hell I am on about when I mentioned surety/security of the person. The only instruments I could point to for Australia is the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Both of which, from what I understand, Australia helped create and are a signatory to and both mention Security of Person.\n\nI'm curious if anyone from Australia has had a similar experience and how they dealt with it or indeed if Scott or anyone can point me in the right direction on how to deal with this.\n\nBecause of the Mayors lack of knowledge regarding Surety/Security of Person I'm not quite sure on how to proceed",
