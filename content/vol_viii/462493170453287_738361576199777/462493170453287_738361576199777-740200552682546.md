   "message": "In this world, the PERSON is NOT fiction. It's real. It's an ACCOUNT you have been given to administrate. Since we didn't ask for it, and we are NOT SURETY for it, our only concern should be: how am I to benefit?\n\nI would say that attaching the person to YOU is the fiction part; along with the attaching of the Trustee's role to YOU; with all the rules and regulations that come along with it.\n\nAnd, in this legal world, I am the only one that can give the PERSON value, for ME. For ME, should be the only  thing that matters, NOT strangers. Otherwise.. I am a SLAVE.\n\nTherefore, SINCE they aren't following rules put in place, that may in fact benefit us, nor care about innocent men or women at home or abroad, it makes sense to create a PERSON we can trust, and lien the fuck out of the PERSON they've created for us.\n\nThis is how I understand it.",
