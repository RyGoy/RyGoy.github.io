   "message": ":D\n\nWell, indeed, it looks fucking confused !! :D\n\nShalom I understand where you are coming from, but I believe these brothers have dug their own whole and it truly get under my skin that we have those who are coming from a place of error making the job of those who are attempting to seek Yah and to say what Yah says and not what wee think. One of the other mistakes is that they are attempting to state that it is 50 literal days. The Scripture states that you shall complete 7 Shabbats and then on the omorrow after you complete 7 Shabbats it will be the 50th day. It is a big difference between counting 1 to 50 and having 50 days period and after 7 shabbats it will be the 50 day. Meaning that you have a new moon day in there or two that would not be counted so it would be the 7 shabbats being 49 plus 1 being the 50th day. The key being you shall count 7 complete shabbats not 49 days.\n\n-Jay Penn",
