   "message": "RED FLAG: Posting undefined acronyms are trained behaviour of cults and government workers. They use them as \"codes\" to make them seem \"scientific\" or \"elite\" because of their \"elite\" government policy language.\n\nPeople who post acronyms that aren't defined, are reacting to TRAINING.\n\nMost of you are too stupid to be an agent of ANYTHING so i get a lot of \"false positives\" using this method. It's about 85% accurate.\n\nALWAYS make a note of people who do this.\n\n/RED FLAG.",
