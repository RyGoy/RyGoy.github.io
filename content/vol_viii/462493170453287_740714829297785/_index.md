   "message": "After talking to a Computer service owner that had a client coming to him for advice, It made me think of something...\n\nThe client had his computer hacked and the hacker is asking for a ï¿½ 2.5 Btc in ransom.\n\nSo the client, who doesn't know anything about chryptocurency, brings the computer to his local computer service store and asks for help.\n\nThe store owner has a few questions, not knowing a lot about chrypto... as well! :/\n\nSo the store owner wants to know if it's better to download a wallet on the client's computer to buy the Bct on e-bay afterward \n\nor\n\nCan he download one himself and do it, for the client?\n(which in this case, he is afraid that the hacker could link his way back to the store owner's system and be exposed to the hacker as well).\n\nAnd my reflexion on this incident is, and please tell me if I am mistaken:\n\nIt's a good thing to have everything backed-up (of course) but to leave your computer empty of any important data does that make it still possible for hackers to get access to this data on a back-up hardrive, does that make sens? :/\n\nThanks!",
