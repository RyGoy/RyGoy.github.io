   "message": "Speaking of teaching YOU idiots, can someone help me with this?\n\nI have some fiat that I need to exchange to BitCoin, but its larger than most exchangers can do.  And if I break it down into smaller transactions, the services such as Money Gram take a very large portion.  Can you recommend an exchange that might be suitable for this type of transaction?  OR should I simply nickle and dime this to death?",
