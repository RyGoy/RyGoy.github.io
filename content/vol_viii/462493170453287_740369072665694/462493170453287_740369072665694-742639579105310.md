   "message": "I understand the the person that Pete administrate is not in a Trust but the person that Admiral has, JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN is in one.\nThey are 2 different person and obviously administrated by different man. Is it the only difference or am I missing something. I thought we were all in one, and that we wouldn't ''make it and/or survive'' without one. \n\nCaptain Pete is working hard at creating is own money so that he can too create his trust or the other way around? Obviously you can have a trust without currency that is a silly question, I retract it... but I still don't understand quite the mechanics here.",
