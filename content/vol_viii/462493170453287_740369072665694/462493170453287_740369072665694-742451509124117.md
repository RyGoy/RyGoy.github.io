   "message": "The President is the Head of State. S/he acts on the advice and authority of the Government but performs a limited number of functions after consultation with an advisory Council of State. S/he receives and accredits Ambassadors. Every law made by Parliament is promulgated by him/her. Bills passed by both Houses of Parliament require his/her signature for their enactment into law. S/he may, before signing a Bill, seek a Supreme Court ruling on whether it is repugnant to the Constitution . \n\n On the nomination of the D�il the President appoints the Taoiseach (Head of Government). On the advice of the Taoiseach and with prior approval of the D�il, S/he appoints the other members of the Government. On the advice of the Taoiseach she accepts the resignation or terminates the appointment of members of Government and summons and dissolves the D�il, but S/he has discretionary power to refuse to dissolve the D�il on the advice of a Taoiseach who has ceased to retain the support of the majority in the D�il. This power, which has not so far been exercised, would force the Taoiseach to resign and give the D�il the opportunity to nominate a successor. \n\n The supreme command of the Defence Forces is vested in the President. S/he is not answerable to either House of Parliament or to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of her office. S/he may, however, be impeached for stated misbehaviour.",
