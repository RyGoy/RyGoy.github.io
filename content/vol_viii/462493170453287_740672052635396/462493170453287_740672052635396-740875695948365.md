   "message": "My question is WHY respond to this polite REQUEST? (rhetorical question)\n\nServiceOntario is ASKING you to do specific things BEFORE IT CAN issue a fancy plastic card. It's a REQUEST for performance NOT a demand.\n\nAnd ServiceOntario has REQUESTED you continue to use the paper record of the childs health number UNTIL you receive said fancy plastic card.\n\nSeems to me the paper record for INFANT SIP, will function just fine. :P",
