   "message": "Holy Fuck.  Seriously.  The way we use energy as a so called \"society\"  none of the things Dave mentioned will work.  I've been making my own bio diesel for 5 seasons now and it's getting harder and harder to do on the cheap.  Sorry David I'm with Scott let's kill 2/3 of the morons and then worry about energy needs.  Everyone is too stupid to hear anything but buy gas.  Everyone I tell about biodiesel thinks I'm a liar or an idiot.  With the same lame advice don't wreck your truck.  Lame.",
