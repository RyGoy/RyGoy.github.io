   "message": "well yes ofcourse without further complicating the matter, ignorance would seem to be a party, however i chose to leave out pages of math and details MOST wouldnt begin to comprehend. much like the tender for law.\n\nthe difference between gas and hydrogen in thermal energy is ~1000:1 add to that one molecule of any gas occupies 24L in volume, so only fabricated as used such as Deans setup would produce (add some pressure release valves), similarly to using solar cells, it is the energy required to put the 'fuel' into storage which would consume much of the available energy, which I accounted for, that you did not.\n\nit takes half an Amper of energy to store one Amper in a battery. if you can use it while you make it, the difference is quite large. putting it into storage is quite costly, which is the difference I was accounting for.",
