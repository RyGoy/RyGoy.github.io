   "message": "haha, sober second thought.\nMy deleted comment from skype conversation last night:\nThe case law on the freeman movement originated in 12th-century Europe and was\ncommon as an English or American Colonial expression in Puritan times. In Colonial times, a man had to\nbe elected to this privilege by the General Court. Being a freeman carried with it the right to vote. By the\nmid 17th century, you needed to take an oath to be recognized freeman. With the abolition of slavery the\nterm became irrelevant BUT the law society, the free mason societies, and guilds continued the practice of\ntaking this oath to their society, which gave these members special rights by society at large; this attracted\npeople who aspired to be in high places, which was exploited by the free masons especially, because so\nmany people in high places were masons and they declared themselves to be the defacto elite, by being\ncalled 'private individuals' in order to distinguish/ privilege themselves as not just being an ordinary citizen.\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/245121839/On-Freedom-of-Expression-and-freeman-rights",
