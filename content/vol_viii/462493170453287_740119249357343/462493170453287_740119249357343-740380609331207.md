   "message": "RE:\"explaining that the man and the person cannot be separated\"\n\nTHEY CAN\"T!\n\nIt has been stated to me, by a trusted source, (as a direct result of this post) that you idiots are missing some key points.\n\n1: \"The Man\" is:\n\na) a \"Natural Person\n\n...AND (Fucking AND!)\n\nb) HER MAJESTY\n\n2: \"The Legal Person = A CROWN ORGANIZATION\n\nHER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION ARE TWO PARTIES IN A TRUST FOR WHICH YOU ARE AGENT AND TRUSTEE. NOT AGENT OR TRUSTEE. AGENT AND TRUSTEE (And the trustee MUST perform) for THE PRINCIPAL\n\nBOTH ARE LEGAL FICTIONS.\n\nHER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION CANNOT BE SEPARATED, and YOU are surety FOR MAJETY under the CROWN AGENCY ACT.\n\n...so next time you are in court, demand that the principal attend, as well! He's an \"accused party\". ;)",
