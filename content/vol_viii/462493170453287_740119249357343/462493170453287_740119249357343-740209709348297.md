   "message": "I recently witnessed how these \"justices\" behave Admiral. Fortunately Tom McKeogh agreed earlier this month that I am not the person I happen to have in my pocket when he deemed the person to have not appeared and entered a conviction in the person's absence. This to harm and coerce me apparently and after the fucktard quotes \"Meads vs Meads\" explaining that the man and the person cannot be separated. Lol!  He knows not what he has done :D \"Judge a man by actions, not by his words\".",
