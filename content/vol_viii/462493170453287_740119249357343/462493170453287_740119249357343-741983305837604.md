   "message": "Scott mentioned somewhere that Gaddafi was removed because the Uniform Commercial Code is the default law that exists where the US Dollar is used and no other law is present. When Gaddafi tried to fuck with the US Dollar, the US Dollar fucked him back.. all LEGAL apparently.\n\nIn regards to Scott's ILLEGAL act..\n\nHe has mentioned before that legalese is copyrighted..\n\nHe is also interfering with others' commerce by teaching this material..",
