TWO PARTIES IN A TRUST FOR WHICH YOU ARE AGENT AND TRUSTEE.\"  If this is this case Admiral Scott does it not contradict the claim that I am the Sole Authorized Administrator for the PERSON? \n\nI had instructed the court that \"I am to be called SIR or ADMINISTRATOR only and do not consent to being called by any PUBLIC NAME\".
