   "message": "This one is a big one for me.\n\nChildren's Aid, doesn't really aid ANYONE. Sometimes the kidnapped kids grow up to be CAS Kidnappers themselves.\n\nIn my 20s I thought a good lesson could be imposed on them; I thought killing THEIR OWN children will give them something to hold their attention, so they aren't kidnapping OTHER people's children.\n\nAt 21 I set out to be THE CAS SERIAL KILLER! *maniacal laugh*\n\n...and that dream ended quickly.\n\nIt turns out CAS workers fall into 1 of 2 classes:\n\n1) Idealistic recent grads of some humanities course, or just a certification in Early Childhood Education, who thinks they're \"making a difference\" and \"really helping the kids\". - These can be neutralized quickly. Sex and a chat, and they're off to new careers. Problem solved.\n\n2) Vile disgusting fat waddling land-whales that NO man has even thought of fucking, muchless breeding with! That's right! THEY HAVE NO CHILDREN TO KILL! THAT\"S where CAS workers COME from!\n\nSo, my career of righteous violence against children, came to a screeching halt, because the children in question failed to exist. :(\n\nI'd have been an AWESOME serial killer too :(",
