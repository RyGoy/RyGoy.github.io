   "message": "Between the time the original \"notice\" was sent and today, I have sent a number of things to the court file notifying them that all has been sent tot he principal debtor. I think the purpose of the liar sending the notice to the company in the first place was to shame larry and hope that the payroll lady would fall for it. The payroll lady has fallen for it, I'm not clear when she spoke with the court clerk, so I'm not sure if the new filings were taken into account or not. Deception and omission is a tool this liar (officer of the court *cough*) has used in all his dealings to date",
