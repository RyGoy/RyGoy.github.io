   "message": "Ok, I need some insight...LARRY received a notice of garnishment and a form to sign to garnish wages....it was returned with cause. The payroll lady said she phoned the court house and was instructed that she was to garnish the wages with this paperwork (the notice had a court clerks signature and the court stamp on it). This relates to the default judgement he lied to receive and the zero balance statement I have. The court file has been liened, a notice of mistake was sent, a request for a bill (again) was sent to the liar, is there anything  that has been missed?",
