   "message": "Via AladdinSane:  There  seems to be some confusion on how to read the article from the Brandon  Sun so here it is copy and pasted ...   The Crown missed the point �  literally � says a judge who acquitted a man who was accused of  threatening a sheriff and police.   In Brandon  provincial court on Friday, Dean Christopher David Clifford was found  not guilty of two counts of uttering threats.   At trial, Crown attorney  Deidre Badcock acknowledged that she didn�t ask her witnesses to point  to Clifford, who sat in court in the prisoner�s box.   Therefore, Judge  Jean McBride said, it wasn�t proven that Clifford was the person heard  making threats in recorded phone calls.  �The central issue in the case  against Mr. Clifford is identity,� McBride said.   �It was incumbent on  the Crown to prove this element of the offence � the Crown has not met  their burden. Identification having not been proven beyond a reasonable  doubt, I must acquit the accused.�  Media reports, and at least one  interview posted on Clifford�s own website, refer to him as a �Freeman  on the Land.�  Courts consider that movement part of a group of  �vexatious� Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Argument litigants.    However, Clifford�s wife says he doesn�t claim to be a Freeman on the  Land, a name she described as a label imposed on people by others.    Clifford describes himself as part of a law movement and speaks in  favour of common law, or natural law, and his website includes video  from a number of seminars.   The threat allegations stemmed from a pair  of recorded phone calls placed from an inmate at the Brandon jail on May  27 and June 18, 2014.   Those recordings were played at Clifford�s  trial in December.   In the first, an inmate says he�s upset because a  Brandon sheriff had previously poked his wife and told her to get up  when she wouldn�t stand for the judge who entered court, which is  custom.   He then threatens to assault the sheriff if he ever sees him  on the street.   In the second call, the inmate made comments which the  Crown alleged to have been a threat to police officers in general.    Clifford, who wasn�t represented by a lawyer, didn�t cross-examine any  witnesses and didn�t call evidence.   It was McBride � who reserved her  decision and delivered her verdict on Friday � who identified a fatal  weakness in the Crown�s case.   She noted none of Badcock�s witnesses  pointed to the accused in the prisoner�s dock as the person who made the  threats.   Badcock had previously said that a testifying police officer  had gestured toward Clifford as he described his arrest at the Brandon  jail.   However, McBride said she didn�t see any gesture by the officer.  Even if the officer had identified Clifford in court, it wouldn�t have  established that the accused was the inmate heard in the calls.   A jail  staff member who�d listened to hundreds of phone calls she believed to  be those of Clifford identified the recorded voice as his.   But McBride  said there was no evidence that witness had watched Clifford as he made  phone calls, so she wouldn�t be able to identify him in court.   The  sheriff who was allegedly threatened and another witness who were  present for the incident said to have sparked the threat against the  sheriff � the courtroom poking of the wife on May 12 � said Clifford was  in court at that time.   McBride was satisfied that that was the  incident referred to in the recorded call in which the sheriff was  threatened.   But, again, McBride said, neither witness indicated that  the Clifford they testified to being in court during the reported poke  was the same man on trial.   Despite Friday�s not guilty verdict,  Clifford remains in custody while pending on charges from another  Manitoba jurisdiction.  Like � Comment\n9 hrs � Like",
