   "description": "Happening NOW: The NYPD is holding a rally for officers right now dubbed #ThankyouNYPD, but there's one problem: not a single person showed up!! \nLike our page US Uncut! \n\nUPDATE: We posted this photo 15 minutes into the rally, but apparently the police supporters were able to gather a few dozen folks.  However, they were vastly outnumbered by counter protesters decrying police violence. \n\nPhoto: Stephanie Keith",
