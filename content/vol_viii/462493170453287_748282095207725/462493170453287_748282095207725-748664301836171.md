   "message": "You, Kerry Verdon, think wrong and value the wrong things.\n\nI'm why you are here; Like it or not. ALL of what I say is right. Not \"some\", or \"most\". FUCKING ALL OF IT!\n\nThe second you present even the possibility of implying even the TINIEST part of what I say is wrong, you can expect TWO things to happen:\n\n1) You will be met with all the ridicule and contempt you deserve.\n\n2) You WILL get the right answer.\n\nAlso know that Stupid Cunt Syndrome is spreading like AIDS in Africa, and as always, women are the victims. With knowledge, eventually even AIDS becomes a choice. Stupid Cunt Syndrome is the only disease you can CHOOSE to get, and there is no cure.\n\nRemember the #1 rule of the Universe, and you will ALWAYS be on the right path... Like it or not.",
