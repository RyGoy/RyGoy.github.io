   "message": "If a TRUST receives MONEY OF EXCHANGE, that money MUST be RETURNED TO THE PUBLIC, after the debt is discharged. Spending it is FRAUD and the trustee that spent it HAS SURETY! Since the SOURCE of the Money of Exchange was the payer, said payer has FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL in \"the public\" (It's PUBLIC DEBT) after all.\n\nThe debt IS PAID! They are just returning what is yours.",
