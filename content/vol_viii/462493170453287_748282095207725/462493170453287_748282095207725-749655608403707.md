   "message": "Ok Kawni Gilroy, :/\n\nTo your question: \n\n�What if the clerk steals the cash and says it was never received? How do u prove u sent cash? \n\nWe have things here in Canada called a VIDEO CAMERA, and I can easely find a friend, and ask him to film me while I am putting these bank notes in the envelop, I will even ask him to film each bank notes, to make sure we see their numbers on the video, and to make sure we wrote the same numbers on the letter�.\n\nI will ask him to film me in continue, until the registered mail letter hit the post box�.\n\nI know, this technology is an ADVANCED one, but we have this in Canada :P\n\nSo if the clerk decides to STEAL these bills, well so be it !!! :D\n\nI will NOT mind, and will NOT care, because of this super complicated technology we happen to have in Canada :D",
