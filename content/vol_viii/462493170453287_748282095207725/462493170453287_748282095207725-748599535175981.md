   "message": "thanks everyone for your support.  One of the reasons I posted this was for some advice.  Clearly you simply want to ridicule.  I thought this page was to make changes.  How can you make changes if you do not show someone into the right direction.\nIf there is a post that I can find in the 'search' section I would have found it. \nIf you have any helpful leads for me to read then please lead me the way.   I want to learn, not be put down. \nI am for teaching others, not putting them down. \nThanks",
