   "message": "Hi all, I have received a fine in the mail for allegedly traveling 51 in a 40 zone.  Due to be paid by tomorrow. \nWhat is the process for paying / not paying these fines?  I've checked the search section but a few different suggestions were discussed but nothing clear on fines sent to by mail via camera.  And couldn't find anything specific in the 'Files' section. \nIt has been suggested I call to \"use the surety of the person to discharge the debt\"\nThanks for your support",
