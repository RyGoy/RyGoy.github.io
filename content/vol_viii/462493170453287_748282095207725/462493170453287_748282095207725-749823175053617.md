   "message": "Okay before I ask you to expand Chris on a side note I'm travelling near Square One today and what do I see? A car in front of me with a Guy Fawks mask in his back window and 2 stickers on the back window. The first was a CopBlock.org sticker reading \"Holding Police Accountable\" (wishful thinking) but the second had an image of JFL with the following \"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.\" :D VERY unusual to see in Ontario.",
