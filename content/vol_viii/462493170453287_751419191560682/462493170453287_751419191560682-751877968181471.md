   "message": "So where does the funds come from to pay for this insurance? OH WAIT, from the taxpayer, as per usual.\n\nThis scheme may \"work\" to reduce police abuses but because the insurers take a cut, the taxpayer will be paying more overall. Insurance Companies would ONLY do this if there was profits to be made.\n\nIf you think the cops wouldn't want a raise to compensate them for their insurance fees, better do the math again.\n\nHere is a fucking idea, apply the rules already in place for everyone, equally. If it doesn't work then, then it is not VIABLE.",
