   "message": "I noticed Scott liked the above. here's my edumacated and fuckulated guess why (so much to unlearn)...\n\n\"Masters do not have to follow legal mandates if they choose not to. Masters can request that servants perform any task\" = I REGISTER a lien because I choose to be a master. \n\n\"The servant does not have to be a servant.\" =  \"Fuck off that's why!\"\n\n\"Cops that do not abrogate rights will have no increase in their premiums.\" = Agents might not, but public agencies might very well have their premiums raised.\n\nAm I even close?",
