   "message": "This line has always caught my interest..\n\nFrom: AGENCY (ARTIFICIAL PERSONS) FOR IDIOTS\n\n\"...you benefit from ONGOING commercial warfare.\"\n\nSince not much is going on here in Tender for Law today, I'm just gonna think out loud and hope I don't stain anything.\n\nMackximus and others have elaborated on the fact that there seems to be a type of codified slavery going on. And reading something that Mackximus typed recently somewhere made me think of Stefan Molyneux's notion of Nation States being farms. (not solely Molyneux's notion, I'm sure)\n\nFor a while now, without asking anybody for the answer, I'd often think to myself: what gives them the right to control commerce in the first place? I'd always simply brush it off with either a placeholder or simply assume that it is a PRESUMPTION that they ACT upon. But maybe it's deeper than that: But probably more simple.",
