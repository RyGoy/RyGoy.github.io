   "message": "THEY control commerce because we use THEIR persons and legal tender in commerce.\n\nWe could kill this \"commerce\" thing, and all that goes with it, and have a bunch of stupid chimps exchanging shit as they wish based on their own value. No one could lawfully interfere with the rights of 2 stupid chimps to exchange a banana for a back rhub...\n\nInfringing on your right to not contract is taking your free choice away from you. If I dont have a choice in regards to who I have to deal with and by what conditions, then I'm effectively a slave.\n\nLast I checked, I didn't make that choice when I was born.",
