   "message": "Usury is illegal and we don�t have right of use unless we pay a use tax this is ultimately defined by something in law called usufruct and this comes from the Latin usus (to use) that is where we get usury or use and other variations. FRUCT means fruit as in fructose � use of the fruit, so a usufruct means we don�t own it but we get the benefit of using it and the usufruct owner/controller gets the fruits of our labor.  We create the fruits of our labor and our VALUE they get to have it.  So until we change this we will not change the fundamentals of how this system works and this is how we have created an elite bankster criminal organization and a renegade government that�s really only a commercial corporation in which all VALUE goes UP and the burden of debt comes down on the masses of the people. All controlled by admiralty is my understanding at this time.",
