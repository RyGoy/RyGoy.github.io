   "message": "But to spoil the learning experience, if it is LEGAL, it means it involves MONEY. And if it involves MONEY, there has to be SURETY, and ACCOUNTING also involved somehow.\n\nIf everything in LEGAL world is of COMMERCIAL nature, then the words \"free\" and \"liberty\" have not really to do with the man, but with PERSONS. And those have \"rights\" and/or \"privileges\". \n\n\"Free\" involves NO ACCOUNTING. And \"liberty\" can be BOUGHT, and/or SOLD by way of CONTRACT.",
