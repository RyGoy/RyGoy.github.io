   "message": "Wow, Will Bed that is a lot of  \"rights\" being claimed. If you claim them, the burden of proof of that claim lies on YOU. Where is the PROOF you are entitled to those \"rights\"?\n\nYou see, we have an imposed alter-reality with commerce. It's here, and I will make the best to understand it, and use it in my favor. I am not fighting it. \n\nStill , I am able to distinguish what is REAL, and observable in NATURE, and on the contrary what is the creation of MEN. Many times, these creations can only come alive in our mind. A MENTAL STATE. \n\nLike GOVERNMENT, for example. GOVERN-MENT. From the Latin words GUBERNARE (to control) and MENTIS or MENS (mind). Put hose together, and that is CODE. \n\nYes the is commerce, but it is a creation of man. Men created it, and men are controlling it.",
