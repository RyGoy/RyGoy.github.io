   "message": "Take Kents example, fishing. Its an illegal act to fish according to the State unless one gets a license. Effectively the granting of permission. But if my understanding of Legal v Lawful is correct, this activity is perfectly Lawful. Its bloody NATURAL actually. Man has been fishing since we crawled out of the slime without the need to obtain permission. We have subverted ourselves to a lower status that requires the asking of permission to do something that can be done without said permission\n\nSo all ACTS etc do prohibit unless we beg to our masters for permission to engage in that act",
