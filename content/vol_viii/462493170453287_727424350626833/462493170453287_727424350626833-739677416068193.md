   "message": "So there IS a difference between UNalienable vs INalienable and yet the definition for INalienable in Black's Law 10th ends with \"-- Also termed UNalienable\" while the definition for UNalienable says \"See INALIENABLE\". \n\nI have read numerous times from Admiral Scott and even in this thread from  Mackximus Minimus that there are no synonyms in law, so what is going on here?",
