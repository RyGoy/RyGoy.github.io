Citizen is an invalid/ward of the state.\nDeclare your status, you are not a corp. employee, or ward!\nThese activities are illegal without permission if you are a ward of the state.\nMarriage licenses are funny, they were created to permit intermarriage with slaves and non slaves. Yet we still get them because we allow the state to be the slave owner!",
