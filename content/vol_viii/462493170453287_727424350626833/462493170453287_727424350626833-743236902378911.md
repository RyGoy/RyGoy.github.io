   "message": "I am with you, Will. I was not attacking you. I am trying to make a point to distinguished between what is created by man, and what is not. Don't listen to Frisbey. He is a moron. \n\nUnfortunately, Scott is always right, and he has indeed said the we are in fact SLAVES. Even Pete got a taste, just recently. And he has as many knuckles as you, and me. \n\nI follow Scott, because I love to acquire knowledge, and he has told me the truth. I have been able to verify. I have PROOF of some things. Accepting reality has helped me focus in what is important. I do not live like a slave, or at least try very hard not to, but I also do not turn my back on the harsh reality that: I live in a plantation, I serve in many folks' agendas, and that violence will come to me if I do not agree to go along. Ask the originals.\n\nBut, I am with you in the agenda of loosing the chains a bit, and having some freedom. \n\nOh, did I mentioned that Frisbey is a moron?",
