   "message": "The definitions have always existed. We just never actually know how to read, and process the information. It was not hidden. If you look at a legal dictionary, you will notice each word has a unique definition. That is not a conspiracy, we just never bothered to learn. \n\nI remember thinking \"Oh, those sneaky bastards They hide this from us!\" after actually READING and UNDERSTANDING a word in the dictionary. I wanted to feel like a victim. I wanted no part in the responsibility.\n\nBut there was no \"sneakiness.\" I was no \"victim.\" The dictionaries are FREE to access. I was just a dumb idiot that pretended to know how to read, and pretended to know what the words actually meant. I just NEVER paid attention. \n\nWho's fault is it, then? :/",
