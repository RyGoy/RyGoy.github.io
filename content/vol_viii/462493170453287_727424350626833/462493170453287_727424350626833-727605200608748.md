   "message": "This licence dilemna has me remembering something Dean Clifford said to me about the marriage licence. Dean told me that I can simply return it to the gubment and inform them that it is no longer required. This stretches credibility mainly because I do not possess the ORIGINAL, only a certified copy so what is there to return since the Registrar General already has the ORIGINAL lol! It's not Deans fault though is it? I mean it's not like he's got a woman....just lots of boyfriends by now I'm sure ;)",
