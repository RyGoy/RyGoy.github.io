   "message": "So in a way, the very simple answer is: The creator of a thing is the controller of the thing.\n\nThrough ONGOING commercial warfare they created commerce. They also created pieces of paper clearly labeled: This Note Is Legal Tender. (They even gave us NOTICE) They also created legalese. So in a way, the key thing is to avoid using all of them. Otherwise one has stepped into COMMERCE.\n\nPerhaps because of the whole awkwardness that comes with stamping humans at birth with a label they HAD to create PERSONS to use in commerce. And they created those too. And based on a post I read from Scott, they've already SECURED THE FUNDS, from those persons. (Birth Certificate like a Certified Cheque)",
