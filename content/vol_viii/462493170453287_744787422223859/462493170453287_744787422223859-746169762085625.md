   "message": "\"No, first the NAME needs to be liened, and then a RESIGNATION LETTER needs to be sent ... with the LIEN hooked to it \"\n\nI have not read anywhere in the TTFL that a NOTICE OF MISTAKE is sent when resigning from government service. Did you pull this out of the library of your ass Who-are You Frisbey? Seriously read what Capitaine Pete wrote. The answer to your question is right there. Fuck don't you think (and I'm presuming a lot here to say that you think) if more needed correcting the Admiral would have corrected the Capitain on more than just  \"The Mayor has nothing to do with the people who created (and therefore underwrite) the name.\" Seriously, enough with the shit stain already.",
