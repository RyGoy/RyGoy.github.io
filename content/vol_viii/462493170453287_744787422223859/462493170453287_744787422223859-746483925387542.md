   "message": "When you resign from an employer, you may CHOOSE to give 2 weeks notice, but it's not necessary.\n\nAll of you seem to focus on bullshit you make up, and don't bother listening to what I say.\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE is a DOCTRINE not a DOCUMENT.\n\nThe Fender has issued 40 (YES, FORTY) such notices in ONE HEARING. Each one was NEW and specific.\n\nYou should be able to respond immediately and know WHEN to use it.\n\nGiving unnecessary notice, draws unnecessary attention.\n\nIn future, Mr Frisbey, if you see me NOT answering a question, it means it was a stupid and/or nonsensical question.",
