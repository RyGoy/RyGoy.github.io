If so, please share.\n\n1 --> WHY?\n2 --> ADVANTAGES?\n\nHow about it's none of your fucking business, that's why lol! No LEGAL NAME no fucking AUTHORity and/or jurisdiction. Still wondering about \"advantages\"? I think being able to live with yourself knowing you haven't volunteered your kid into a system of codified slavery is high up there.
