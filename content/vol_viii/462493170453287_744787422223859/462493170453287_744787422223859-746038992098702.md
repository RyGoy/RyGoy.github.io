   "message": ":/ Okay...Did you read the Capitaine's question? \"WHAT mistake would you want to NOTIFY in regards of your little boy/girl's person?\"  This is what some folks might call a hint. Did you not just read and I quote \"FORMAL RESIGNATION. PERIOD.\" Seriously, what do you think this means? Do you  recall the Admiral EVER saying that a NOTICE OF MISTAKE can be used to NOTIFY the Registrar General regarding the birth certificate? And NOTIFY them of what...that I did not understand what I was doing when I didn't know that your VITAL STATISTICS ACT only actually applies to the PERSON and not a man?",
