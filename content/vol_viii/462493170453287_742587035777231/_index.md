   "message": "Scott Duncan  As  you know there is a liar who is intent on punishing me as an example for all others. Is it possible to offer a claim against him up for your takings or someone you know? I'm having difficulties with this and I feel that the only way for this clown to really appreciate the system he defends so viciously is to feel it's Wrath to the fullest. Would this be acceptable or of interest to you or one of your Captains?",
