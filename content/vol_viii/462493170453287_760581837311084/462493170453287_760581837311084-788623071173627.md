   "message": "\"Im in a rush so im just gonna cut the meat and go to the bone.\n\nNow according to the criminal code of canada a person along with owner and every one and similar expressions includes her majesty and an organization. That is the definition which is in the criminal code.\n\nMy question is this. If i kill all of you mother fuckers and be charged under the code at section 229 which applies to persons, will the crown bring forth PROOF that i am actually HER MAJESTY? Or will they ignore the law and prosecute me without any authority to do so. Its also important to note that i have served my notice of public waiver and benefits and my resignation with my secured lien. Will you follow the law and let me go or ignore the law you claim to uphold for the sake of \"teaching me a lesson\"\n\nWarning....i can kill you from my living room and not even move.\n\nTHAT will DEFINITELY get their attention. it did int he court. its how i was able to get my son back. court finally realized they cant get anything out of me and they just....well...gave up.",
