   "message": "Food for thought regarding Mike McCormack of the police union... He demands the resignation of the Chair from the TPSB for posting a meme on social media about deaths caused by police in the U.S..  He says that this \"lifted the veil on his true personal feelings\".  He's also are quoted as having said, �We have no trust in Alok Mukherjee any more. And that�s speaking for my membership.�\n\nThis is troubling.  First of all, I would think that the police union's raison d'etre is police labor issues.  I wouldn't think it would extend to people's observations of police activity in the public except as relates to labor issues.\n\nWhat is really troubling is Mr. McCormack's apparent judgment that acknowledging the issue of police brutality and murders in the U.S. should be viewed as a reason to condemn the Chair.  I have then, a few questions for Mr. McCormack and since I do not have his organization's proper name or his contact information, I ask you to pass these on to him.\n\nMr. McCormack, why do you think it's wrong to acknowledge that we have a police brutality problem here in the U.S.?  We have videos without number showing clear acts of battery and murder committed by police.  Yet you say that acknowledging these facts means one is biased???  Mr. McCormack, why do you think crimes of battery and murder committed by police in the U.S. are okay?  Why would recognition of this in social media indicate that someone is biased?  All in all, Mr. McCormack, do you not see that your judgment essentially constitutes a commitment to the code of silence which keeps good officers from reporting crimes committed under color of law by their peers?  Do you think it's acceptable that a police labor union head condones battery and murder committed by police in the U.S.?  In closing I say this... you, Mr. McCormack, and people like you, are exactly the reason that police brutality occurs and continues.  You, and people like you, are exactly the reason why in case after case after case, \"internal investigation\" clear the badged assailants of any wrong doing.  It is why police officers who do report such crime are railroaded out of their jobs.  It is why the people look to the institutions which are supposed to provide the administration of justice and crime control as failures.  Thank you, Mr. McCormack.",
