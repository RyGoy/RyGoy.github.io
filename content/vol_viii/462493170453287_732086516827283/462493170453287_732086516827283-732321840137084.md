   "message": "funny story Pete....my ex was walking my dog when she was a puppy..they walked by this old grumpy man sitting in a chair at Starbucks, she went up to him to say hello and he kicked her, my ex didnt think twice, kicked the motherfucker in the chest and knocked him out......my guess is he will never kick a dog again....I would do the same if someone kicked my dog on or off a leash.....if a dog is biting thats a different story then its fair but not a sweet dog just saying hello.....most people who have dogs that bite do not let them off leash unless they are complete idiots.....I was biten by a dog a few years ago that was on a leash and my back was turned so I do know it hurts like hell",
