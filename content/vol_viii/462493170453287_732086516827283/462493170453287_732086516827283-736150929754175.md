   "message": "Escalated confrontations, of course.  I'm very up front about not getting my head blown off.  But if it is a stupid checkpoint, I can be a good little slave, show them a piece of plastic, and continue to progress to my destination (i.e. work, appointments), and NOT be late.  I pick and choose my battles.  I'd rather expend time and energy administrating the PERSON properly, versus arguing with an ignorant EMPLOYEE who takes huge offense to questioning (and not consenting) his fictional authority, because he is violating my right to simply go from point A to point B.\n\nMaybe some of you are \"there\" and can confidently tell a COP to screw themselves.  I'm not there, yet.",
