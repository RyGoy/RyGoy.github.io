   "message": "Maybe my thought process is off wack, and I do value the clarity in this group when it comes to definitions and the origins of words (I really do), but if one man/woman says that \"so and so\" means 'this' and another man/woman disagrees and says that \"so and so\" means 'that'.  Does one man/woman's definition stand above some other man/woman's definition?  I don't think so.",
