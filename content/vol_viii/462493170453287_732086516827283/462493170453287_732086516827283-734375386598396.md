   "message": "Scott Duncan, In UK a Public school and a \"Public house\" are in private juridiction. The school is funded by private sources and the 'Pub' restricts the public from breaking the law (lic. sale of intoxicants, public drunkeness ). The \"Pub\"  operates a 'commercial premise' to be fair to their patrons and respectfull to the laws (commerce, criminal). \nWhat status and title do Publicans have that commoners don't, the first is loyal to the Sovereign the later is submissive?\nIs this a reason why the clubhouse was set up in Temple Bar?",
