Second, why would you advocate an archaic storage of value? Third, you clearly can't see the difference between a medium for exchange and a storage of value....\nJust now � Like\n\nChris Evan Dave, that seems like a very easy way to not have to use you brain....ad hominem.\nJust now � Like\n\nRob Phillips Short of a complete global cashless system being implemented, I expect silver to do very well. I will still be buying the next time it hits $50.\nJust now � Like\n\nChris Evan I am not a troll, I was actually at the seminar in which Dean was kidnapped at. I am simply trying to inject a little bit of reason into this page....\nJust now � Like",
