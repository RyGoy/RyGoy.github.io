   "message": "at some point in time the price of silver will out pace the price of gold, not saying silver will be worth more then gold but based on what its worth right now and where it will head You may be better off buying silver . Myself not a believer in the metals its no different then paper it only gets the value we give it so as long as society buys into preserving their wealth you will always have the current class structure in place and nothing will ever change because those at the top will always have more",
