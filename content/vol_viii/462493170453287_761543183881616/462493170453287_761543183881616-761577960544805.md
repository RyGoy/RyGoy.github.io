   "message": "<<Confidential Communication\n\nA form of Privileged Communication passed from one individual to another, intended to be heard only by the individual addressed.\nA confidential communication is ordinarily between two people who are affiliated in a confidential relation, such as an attorney and client, Husband and Wife, or MASTER and SERVANT.\n\nIf this type of communication is made in the presence of a THIRD PARTY, whose presence is not necessary for such communication, it is not considered privileged. In certain cases, the presence of a third party might be required, as where there is a language barrier such that one of the individuals engaged in the confidential communication needs an interpreter.>>\n\nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/confidential+communication",
