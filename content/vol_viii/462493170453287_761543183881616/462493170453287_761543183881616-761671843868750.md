   "message": "Scott, I'd like to learn more about the details / mechanics of the \"that's your right\" part of it ? \n\nI really wanna do it, matter of fact, I may HAVE to do it if/when I need to use this SIGNED AFFIRMATION they made as PROOF that they're all a bunch of fraudsters... But I also REALLY WANNA let them KNOW I did it, and mostly WHY I have NO INTENTION to let them get away with stamping whatever bullshit they may puke with a CONFIDENTIAL stamp just because they don't have the balls to stand behind their statements.\n\nAm I wrong thinking that it would make sense that if I send information to another party and REQUIRE that the info be kept CONFIDENTIAL, I should notify the other party and make sure they agree, so that if they don't I can just not send the info ???",
