   "message": "Yeah I read that. But I have no RELATION with these guys.\n\nI'm thinking CONFIDENTIAL applies to information which one party doesn't want disclosed... Like I have info which I agree to send you but require you keep it CONFIDENTIAL.\n\nBut there really doesn't seem to be ANY INFORMATION in there that's justified being slapped as CONFIDENTIAL.\n\nHow can you even require that your OPINION be kept CONFIDENTIAL ? \nIf you don't assume what you just said, why did you fuckin say it ??\n\nA WRONG OPINION is a WRONG OPINION and it seems that trying to prevent ME from seeking CONFIRMATION that an OPINION is indeed WRONG or even FRAUDULENT would be a fuckin joke ?\n\nAnd how could a DECISION even be kept CONFIDENTIAL if one PARTY doesnt AGREE with the decision of the other ?",
