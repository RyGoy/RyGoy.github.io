   "message": "So I asked many questions to the scholar board over the past few months, regarding the PERSON�s SURETY and the fact that they seemed to ignore or refuse to respect some of their LEGAL obligations.\n\nThey had their liars send a demand letter to the PERSON I have, basically trying to order ME to shut the F up and not ask one more question to their pretended client.\n\nI slapped all of this back in an envelop, their original demand letter marked REFUSED / NO CONTRACT with a 5 page communication rebutting all their bullshit claims, and I copied the Bar association and Minister of Justice on this.\n\nI made it clear I WISHED they return the SURETY BOND and Bills of exchanges with certain conditions, and told them that if they were indeed mandated by the scholar board - which didnt want to even touch the subjects about which I was questioning them - to reply to me, I required that they answer the questions their pretended client didnt want to answer, it seems they would know what I�m talking about�\n\nI got a reply today.\nTheir first letter seemed to use a pretty aggressive and authoritarian language,\nThis one, VERY POLITE ACTUALLY. \n\nThey MARKED that COMMUNICATION with a red CONFIDENTIAL stamp.\nSeriously, I dont UNDERSTAND what�s so important in this that they marked it as CONFIDENTIAL.\nI might very well let them know that I really see no justification for that�\n\nNOW, what is the LEGAL implications of this red CONFIDENTIAL stamp ?\nDoes it mean ONLY THEY can AUTHORIZE the release of the content of this letter ?\nI mean you see CONFIDENTIAL all the time in the footer of emails, basically saying if you�re not intended to receive this communication, you are not AUTHORIZED to disclose the content�\n\nIf so,\nCould a Creative Commons license be used to AUTHORIZE the release the content ?",
