   "message": "\"They = The SALEM DISTRICT COURT. Think about this Adrian....if everyone had the bond number or name of the insurance company then it would be very expensive for the SALEM DISTRICT COURT to obtain a bond. Why would they self inform?\"\n\nI see where you are going with that thought, but I don't see the point in wasting time chasing that. Most likely, there will not be a response, and it is only a courtesy to copy the claim to them (Insurance provider)... The SALEM DISTRICT COURT is the one responsible. If you get the bond they (SALEM DISTRICT COURT) are using today, they can switch insurance providers tomorrow... So it is their (SALEM DISTRICT COURT's) responsibility to get their insurance provider to pay, not yours.",
