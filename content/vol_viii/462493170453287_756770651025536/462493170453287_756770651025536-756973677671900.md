   "message": "Adrian Thomson, if you incur in some EXPENSE as an AGENT for a company/PRINCIPAL you \"work\" for, I think is prudent for the PRINCIPAL to see proof of that EXPENSE. I am sure there are administration, and accounting rules for this, but I have no clue of what those are and/or the mechanics of them. :/  \n\nI mean, that ORGANIZATION does NOT belong to ME. It's tied to ME (by FORCE, and/or IGNORANCE, and/or both), but I am under the impression that, since LEGALLY all property belongs to the government/PRINCIPAL, one must return all property to it's \"rightfully\" OWNER. \n\nPete, does this makes sense?",
