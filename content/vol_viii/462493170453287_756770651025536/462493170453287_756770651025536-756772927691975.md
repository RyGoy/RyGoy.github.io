   "message": "I had 3 cases all Operating after Suspension.  One case was settled for $500 plus fees, one was settled for $400 plus fees, the last was $1000 plus fees.  As Scott pointed out, my issue was not resigning.  However, it seems that no matter which way you look at this, I could ONLY have been an AGENT of a PRINCIPAL.  So, as AGENT, I would like to be reimbursed for my expenditure.  \n\nMy expenses were also a shitload of registered mail, days in court, days in jail, etc....\n\nI wrote to the Governor while this was going on seeking protection because of what their fancy Constitution says.  He declined to \"get involved with citizens legal issues\".  \n\nI have ALL the receipts because I knew I would do something with them...I was just not sure what!  Now....I think I should send this to the Registrar along with an invoice for reimbursement.  Then..of course, statement, default, lien.  I've liened the Security and I've liened all the court files.",
