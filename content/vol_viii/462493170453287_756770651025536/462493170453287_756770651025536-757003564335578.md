   "message": "I am really confused now. :/  I honestly thought, after reading the AGENCY article from Scott, that as SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATORS we are in in fact acting as TRUSTEES, AND AGENTS for the PRINCIPAL and/or AGENCY. Scott Duncan, please correct me if I am wrong. But I feel very strongly about this one. If not, I really want to know. \n\nThe \"remedy\" within the codified slavery is that we may address we are only acting as AGENTS of the GOVERNMENT, the government being the PRINCIPAL and/or AGENCY, having SURETY. Because... it is US that give anything to that \"government.\" That is the Tender for LAW that money provides, which none of us are getting any more. \n\nWe did not asked for it, nor they make it any easy to \"not play.\" I DID NOT CREATE THE PERSON! Does this make any sense?",
