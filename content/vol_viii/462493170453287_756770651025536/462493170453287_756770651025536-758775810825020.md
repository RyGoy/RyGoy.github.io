   "message": "In light of this convoluted thread, Chris, the SALEM DISTRICT COURT is a SUBSIDIARY of the COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.  Now, that would make this Court a \"sub-corp\" OF the COMMONWEALTH.    The Salem District Court is a \"sub-division\" of the STATE/ COMMONWEALTH.  \n\nDoes this make sense to you?  \n\nNow, the Court is NOT a PERSON.  It is a BUSINESS TRUST; under the STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS.  (Look at mutual funds in this state for an example and how they are handled.) \n\nNow, WHO is in control of these funds at the local level?  The Clerk of Court from SALEM DISTRICT COURT...MUST account and balance these funds from the court....these funds are not normally held in a local bank; therefore, they MUST BE transferred to the STATE level.  And......my computer just froze on this line....",
