   "message": "My understanding is the Bond # is not the Docket #....My understanding is the Bond # is for \"civil damages\" which would be statutory.  The bond for so-called \"civil servants\" in the States, are for \"civil rights\" violations.  That is another animal......\n\nBack to where my connection froze.......the Clerk of Court transfer the court funds to the STATE level (i.e., Clerk tranfers MOA to CRIS funds at the State level.  The State then invests these \"funds\").  CRIS = Court Registry Investment System.  This is very common of FEDERAL Courts located in each State; in fact, the Clerk at the Federal District Courts transfers these funds directly to the US Treasury and do NOT use a local bank.  They have a direct account with the US Treasury facilitated by the Federal Reserve.  These US District Courts tender a digital transfer and receive T-Bills as their investments.  Yes, funds are tendered IN and OUT of this system via the court.  \n\nScott, I would love to hear your input on this from the US point of view and how the courts operate here.  \n\nAll TTFL folks, I am very tired, so if I have screwed this up...rest assured that Scott will clean up this stain shit.  :D",
