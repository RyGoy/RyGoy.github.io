   "message": "When one is faced with \"new terms\" of contract, they have a choice to end the contract, agree and continue the contract, or renegotiate the terms (volley offers to and fro, in good faith, until agreement or dismissal).\n\nWhen FaceBook invents \"new terms\" to existing contracts, the use IS acceptance to the terms.\n\nI USE FaceBook, so think of myself as a CONSUMER but am I something else outside this capacity to the FaceBook? If FaceBook can use my creations for use, Do I become an AGENT?\n\nJust a thought  :/",
