   "message": "I had.a bill from the FTB...which I actually didn't owe...it was based on an assessment. ..they send a bill and on the bill it says if you don't pay they can lien your bank account. ..u get one notice and then they take your money. ..it's crazy how the banks do whatever they say without a court order signed by a a judge or a judgment. ..it took me 2 years to clear it up...I was able to get the bank to refund me when I threatened to sue them for criminal conversion...it was a nightmare",
