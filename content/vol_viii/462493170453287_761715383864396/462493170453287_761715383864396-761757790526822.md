   "message": "Like glue that holds the other pieces together? What are the other pieces though?\n\nScott asked us in a call not long ago, \"Have you planned for what you will do if you succeed?\"\n\nHe told us in a post that \"Those who can THINK will survive, and those that cannot will go extinct.\" (paraphrased)\n\nIn another comment he said something about ... \"If you spend 2 hours a day READING on the subject of your chosing, you will become an expert on that subject within 7 years...\" \nIf I want faster results, I can increase the amount of time per day :)\n\nWell this is it for me. This is what I want to become an expert with. THINKING.\n\nEVERY single other part of my life will fix itself if I can figure out how to fix this.\n\nWith computer science, everything is either ON/OFF, TRUE/FALSE right? So HOW does one set about to reformat their brain's operating system to work this way? But first, what EXACTLY is the new programming that I wish to install there?",
