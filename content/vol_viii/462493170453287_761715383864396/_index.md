   "message": "Ok folks, I've got another dumb question.\n\nI am sure it won't be the last, but if I can find the complete answer, perhaps it will be the last dumb question I post here.\n\nWhy is Scott ALWAYS right?\n\nWe have all heard him say (figure of speech, because he actually typed it):\n\nIt's all about Surety and Accounting.\nTRUST but Verify.\nFigure out WHY I'm Right.\nComputer Science is the answer to EVERYTHING.\nThe Majority is ALWAYS wrong.\nEtcetera.... (There are tons of examples)\n\nI have not seen anyone pose this question though in all of the posts I have read on the Tender for Law group.\n\nHe has told us plenty of times however that he has not been blessed with any sort of special powers, he has the same mental faculties that we have.... So HOW does he do it?\n\nWhat mechanism does he employ to solve a problem, or answer a question, or identify and dismiss bullshit that crosses his desk? And, how can I do that as well? How can I employ a systematic process of mental evaluation for any subject matter or topic that will give accurate results EVERY time?\n\nEven more important to me though is, How can I instill that method into my offspring to ensure that they are able to think their way out of any problem on their own?\n\nNow all of the regular contributors here have shown examples of how they work through specific questions, define the words used, cite sources, legal maxims, logical fallicies, etc. I am wondering if all of that can be wrapped up into a concise method to cut through all the crap and interference that comes up and focus on what is important.\n\nCan computer science methodology be applied to our own brain?\n\nI doubt that there really is a clear answer to this (frankly rather rambling) post, but this concept has been rolling around in my brain for some time now.\n\nI am sure you have all heard the old saying about \"Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, feed him forever.\" What if the same thing was applied to thinking critically?\n\nFeel free to cut this to shreds guys.",
