   "message": "So far, I have come up with various pieces of the overall picture on my own, but it is not yet complete and my goal with this thread is to get HELP :)\n\nThe \"lost tools of learning\" essay by Dorothy Sayers alluded to the Trivium Method of Grammar/Logic/Rhetoric as was used in the schools of Plato and Aristotle. This appears to be a good \"base\" to start with working on reprogramming because it introduces a sytematic concept of dealing with things as they come. In many ways it also parallels with computer science in the form of input/processing/output. But, it proves to be rather difficult to install it on it's own into my brain because it is not complete. There is also issues of concentration and focus that are not readily overcome by that method alone which leaves you with wasted time.\nWe have covered here that time is the only thing we have of any real value, and frankly I am sick of wasting it chasing rabbits down fancy holes.\n I want to cut straight to what is important just like Pete does with any issues we discuss on SURETY :)\n\nThe Logical Fallicies lectures by Lenonard Pekoff were quite valuable as well, which when practiced can \"help\" to give you a heightened \"bullshit detector\". It too, like anything requires practice (which is ongoing over here)\n\nI am missing a lot of pieces though and since I don't have a picture to reference I am still lost. :(",
