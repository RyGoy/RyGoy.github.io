   "message": "Ok, I'm going to have a stab at the question:\n\nWHY IS SCOTT ALWAYS RIGHT?'\n\nAs a prorogued noble, (ie: one of them- no disrespect intended), his thinking is structured the same way, totally lacking in belief, because as we know, ALL BELIEF IS EVIL...this gives a massive headstart to the deprogramming we are collectively undergoing & challenging, which is in part, why we THINK WRONG AND VALUE THE WRONG THINGS...\n\nWe start the 'game' with the distinct disadvantage of faulty programming & the time drain of deprogramming/reprogramming & whether it is even possible to fully discard this programming.\n\nSo, what is the alternative to belief?\n\nQuestion/hypothesise, test, validate or discard....repeat cycle ad infinitum.\n\nThis requires a significant amount of self discipline, a lack of bias, the ability to consistently apply the scientific method/computer algorithm ie: a very specific way of thinking, which explains the statement:\n\nCOMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING.\n\nThis in turn raises another question:\n\nIS SCOTT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS ALWAYS RIGHT, OR IS THERE A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THE SAME WAY, THAT THINK CORRECTLY AND ARE CONSEQUENTLY ALWAYS RIGHT?\n\nMy thinking is that there is a group/entire community of people that can also be 'always right'.\n\nIF Scott is the ONLY one who is ALWAYS RIGHT, then I am only able  to imagine one scenario where that would be the case:\n\nWHERE ALL THE PARAMETERS ARE UNDER HIS CONTROL, which would explain why the 'game' has already been won.\n\nI'm sure I'm only just scratching the surface here...",
