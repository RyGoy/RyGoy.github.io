   "message": "First time I read one of Scott Duncan post I knew this men is what he says he is.....when I than begun to dig deeper and verified for me what it was he is saying I realized shit this men is so much more than I thought he was......I am now a student of computer systems second year in ireland, Scott Duncan kicked my arse so hard but gave me something incredible. With every module i study especially the discrete maths last semester, I am seeing the glimpses of why Scott Duncan is always right......\n\nBecause fuck YOU that's why :-p",
