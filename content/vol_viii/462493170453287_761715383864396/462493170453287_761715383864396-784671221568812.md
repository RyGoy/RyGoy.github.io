It is not difficult to think that the Admiral may have shared such a Torrent link though as I've never heard anyone else talk about it ever. Folks either do not know they lie, do not think they lie, don't know what a fucking lie is,or  lie so fucking often they don't notice the lies anymore. Sounds like I should approach this with great caution Capitaine Pete lol!",
