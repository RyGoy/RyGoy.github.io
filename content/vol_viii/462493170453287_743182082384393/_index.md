   "message": "http://www.freedomadvocates.org/agenda-21/\n\nScott Duncan, is the UN Agenda 21 Program one of the agendas you are preparing to fight / politically conceded / hence why you are now the Admiral with war drums beating? I can see why traffic issues etc are not such a big deal. In Ireland everything in planning and development has to go through the regional development agencies / plans before getting approval from local County Councils. The depopulation of rural areas, immigration to Cities and emigration to other countries (becoming second class citizens and celebrating), cutbacks in hospitals, closures of police stations, the rise of CCTV towers etc. There are strategies in place for the last 10 years or so(before the last recession) planning Ireland for 2020. This has been rolled back to Ireland 2030 (NCB Stockbrokers are one company that advised on its publication if anyone interested). Its not just planning, its population growth / control, prosperity, living standards etc. In the video Michael Shaw is speaking on how it is being implemented in Santa Cruz, CA, under the cover of different federal agencies and how to try and take the power back. I assume the power will not be taken back politically. I look forward to the launch of Thetenderforlaw.com website later this month and further educating myself on and / or combating what 'lies' ahead. Pardon the pun. B",
