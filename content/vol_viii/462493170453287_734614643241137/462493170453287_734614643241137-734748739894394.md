   "message": "From the wall of Francisco Damiï¿½n Folch Torres:\n\n<<Mackximus Minimus, the world is full of money-loving (Atheistic and hypocrite Religious) voluntary slaves for USURA to exploit. MODERNITY and MATERIALISM is what rules the world--and what has brought the world to its current calamity. For two thousand years USURA has constantly attacked the spirit of Man and the Church--breaking and corrupting them into submission.\n\nYour FACTs are wacky--you are ignoring and distorting much of history: <<As a result of the Hampton Court Conference of 1604, a new translation and compilation of approved books of the Bible was commissioned to resolve issues with different translations then being used. The Authori[z]ed King James Version, as it came to be known, was completed in 1611 and is considered a masterpiece of Jacobean prose.[121]>> Christianity did not start at the year 1611.\n\nNor the King James Bible the first to be printed: <<Written in Latin, the Gutenberg Bible is an edition of the Vulgate, printed by Johannes Gutenberg, in Mainz, Germany, in the 1450s.>> And Gutenberg was no \"nobility\".\n\nAdditionally, <<Copyright came about with the invention of the printing press and with wider public literacy. As a legal concept, its origins in Britain were from a reaction to printers' monopolies at the beginning of the 18th century. Charles II of England was concerned by the unregulated copying of books and passed the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 by Act of Parliament,[5] which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the Stationers' Company, essentially continuing the licensing of material that had long been in effect.>>\n\nYou, yourself, are following, a self-claimed \"better than Jesus\" condescending lawyer \"authority\" who promised service to the English crown, the House of Windsor.\n\nYou are helping USURA's next generation currency, with a worldwide computerized accounting and patent/contract registry. Just because there is currently no charging of INTEREST does not relieve it from being USURY. USURA no longer needs INTEREST, it has grabbed everything already. Cryptocurrencies are INFINITE and INFINITELY divided. Cryptocurrencies meet the Synarchic agenda. Decentralizing is really globalizing.\n\n\"Merchant princes\" are bankers, you know, like the Rothschild...and most being maritime traders but another name for them is \"mercantile plutocrats\". In fact, there is little difference between a \"merchant prince\" and a pirate.>>\n\n<< Mackximus Minimus, you were a beautiful loving man but have relinquish your soul to become a condescending Atheists that BELIEVE in insults rather that to be a guardian of TRUTH.\n\nHistory has been rewritten, altered or omitted by USURA.\n\nFACTS need not be TRUTH. FACTS are things that happened.--in today's world that usually means lying, stealing and hurting your neighbor.\n\nNow, you are acting as a bully and like a bully you cowardly went back to your Atheists \"friends\" at The Tender For Law wall so they would gang up on me--or at least have me \"purged\" as their hateful intolerance compulsively do.\n\nPity that men must relay on laws (fiction) to behave. Laws have no love or compassion, empathy or forgiveness.>>",
