   "message": "hahaha...got this in my email today:\n\n \nHappy Anniversary !!!\nPlease visit DeanClifford.info to receive the full Victoria seminar from 2013 as a gift to you.\n� Time sure fly�s when you�re having fun! It seems like only yesterday I was kidnapped and tortured by agents, officers, and employees of HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA and its corporate subsidiaries, simply for teaching the men and women of this land their natural rights and for daring to restore real law, order and justice to this land.\nTo celebrate this occasion in history, I have an anniversary gift for you all � My June 2013 Victoria Seminar in its entirety. Please Watch, Learn, and Share Far and Wide.�\nNamaste ~ Dean C. Clifford November 24, 2014\n� The people of the land known as Canada have never had an organic government, nor have they ever written their own constitution� Govern yourselves accordingly�� ~ Dean Clifford\n\nhttp://deanclifford.info/2014/11/24/happy-anniversary/\n\nMake sure to subscribe to my social channels for future announcements and updates:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DeanCliffordChannel\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/DeanClifford\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DeanCClifford\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/DeanCliffordChannel\n\nhttp://DeanClifford.tumblr.com/",
