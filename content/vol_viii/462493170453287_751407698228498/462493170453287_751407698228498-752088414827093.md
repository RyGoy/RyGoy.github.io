   "message": "While reading about Dean in this anniversary hype, I ended-up watching a few of his videos, mostly his updates from the FORTRESS OF REMAND *Hotel & Casino, and Banana-Rama.\n\nIn all seriousness, what a dangerous thing Dean, Menard, Bonnacci, Shrout, Turner, etc, have been doing. To think I once paid attention to Dean, scares the shit out of me.  I do not exaggerate when I say this.\n\nI bet if I get money for every man, and woman that found his/her life destroyed after paying for fraud, I could be a millionaire. \n\nI bet in all thousands, and thousands in the US, Australia, Canada, etc, have gone to jail, and/or have the courts destroyed their lives after assisting to a \"seminar.\" These \"gurus\" have contributed to feed the jail/court system, while charging money. It's a tragedy.",
