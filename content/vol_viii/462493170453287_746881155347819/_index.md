   "message": "Scholar taxes.\n\nI needed them to send a zero balance statement within a couple weeks, no time to waste with incompetent or ignorant people there, so I sent BOTH the bill of exchange AND a cheque, telling them they had to carry on their legal obligations in regards to the bill of exchange and if they cash both instruments they'd have to send a CREDIT to the person...\n\nThey banked the cheque and returned the bill of exchange with no explanation or refusal notice.\n\nI sent the bill of exchange back to them, along with all the info/instructions (which they already received) in regards to their legal obligations.\n\nThey had their liars send a demand letter that the person stops annoying them with communications or they'll sue !!? \nWTF ? I guess someone feels rather uncomfortable with all this !??\n\nFirst time I ever have to deal with threats from 3rd party interlopers...\n\nIs the proper thing to do, in this case, to keep copies of everything they sent and send the original papers and envelop back to them ? \nI guess it is necessary to void these papers ?\n\nThe scholar board still holds the bill of exchange and surety bond. I obviously want those back. \n\nIs the proper thing to do to require from the liars that they make sure their client fulfills its legal obligations and return the documents ? It seems going directly to the scholar board would only upset them even more and I have no intention of creating controversy... And I certainly do not want to imply any commerce with them liars...",
