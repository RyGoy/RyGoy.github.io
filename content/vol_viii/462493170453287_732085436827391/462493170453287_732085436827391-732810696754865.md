   "message": "It seems that Article 332 confirms that the RIGHT of a MAN/WOMAN to the PERSON's SURETY MUST be juridically recognized if anyone has forced the PERSONNALITY upon a MAN or WOMAN who can PROVE he is NOT the PERSON, to constrain him/her to act as SURETY (pay or rott in a cage)... \n\nI guess using a PERSON you TRUST may be necessary, because courts dont recognize MEN and WOMEN... But in French they don't use the word \"PERSON\", they use \"int�ress�\" which means whoever has something to lose... A MAN sure has a lot of TIME to lose...\n\nBut I'm going to have to try and see if they define \"int�ress�\"...",
