   "message": "(I re-typed the original post's conversation with revenue. I was a bit hard to follow originally if any admin wants to edit the op and insert the following...)\n\nThe \"Rick Hiltz no one knows WHY he deleted that precious thread\" thread... \n\nRick Hiltz : Today the lovely folks at Revenue Canada sent along an invoice to the estate of my recently deceased father for the amount of $102.25 for 2 checks issued under the Ontario Trilium Benefit program . I am currently in possession of both checks . I have had conversations where i was told i would be issued an invoice if i did not return the checks...\n\n*CONVERSATION WITH REVENUE*\n\nRick :  \"Will you be requiring the return of the checks you sent to my deceased dad?\" \n\nRevenue : \"Yes. Please return them ASAP or you will be invoiced for the amount issued\"\n\nRick :  \"Why would you invoice the estate for something they never exchanged for legal tender? Do you have any reason to believe that your books do not balance?\"\n\nRevenue:  \"It doesn`t matter you need to return the checks\"\n\nRick:  \"Ok are you going to forward me the postage and pay the invoice for my time and effort to perform for revenue Canada?\"\n\nRevenue: \"No if you don`t return them you will be billed for them\"\n\nRick : \"How can you bill me for something  still in revenue Canada`s possession? The money is still in your possession, the checks have not been cashed and since you refuse to pay for my services then the checks shall remain here in such times as a Revenue Canada employee shows up at the door showing valid ID and picks them up and issues a receipt for doing so.\"\n\nRevenue : \"That will not happen\"\n\nRick : \"Ok so I will just shred them. I don`t give a fuck about your books balancing, have a nice day\"\n*END CONVERSATION*",
