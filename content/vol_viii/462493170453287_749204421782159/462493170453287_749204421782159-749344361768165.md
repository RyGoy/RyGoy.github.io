   "message": "Banks used to send my cheques back to me. They were part of a monthly statement/accounting service. \n\nMy credit union sent them back as well. They did so until I realized I was paying fees for that service and cancelled it.\n\nIf I remember correctly, there were holes punched in them (or was I dreaming) and of course they had stamps from different companies on the private side.",
