   "message": "\"Yet here I am... the ONLY one who tells the truth. Why is this true? Why does EVERY OTHER SOURCE LIE?\" \nFuck! Taking from the lesson of \"if it's hard you're doing it wrong\" I think it's because every other source \"believes\". They believe they are telling the truth. They believe that half truths and/or lies by ommission is not lying and convince themselves this is the same as telling the truth. They believe their own bullshit. I got nothing else.",
