   "message": "How do you do it, Christians? How do you go through EVERY SINGLE DAY, knowing you are a lying, deluded, evil, ignorant, violent sack of shit, with an imaginary friend?\n\nHow do you live with your own self-imposed ignorance?\n\nYou DON'T, do you? You just lie, and pretend to believe in the sky-daddy, because everyone around you \"believes\"... except they are EXACTLY THE SAME as you. Yes THEY KNOW THEY ARE LYING PIECES OF SHIT, TOO!\n\n...but the ONE common ground, EVERY Piece-of-Shit Christian has, the world over, is that they are all COWARDS. NONE of them get the spine to ask their fellow Piece-of-Shit Christians if they are the SAME pieces of shit that THEY are.\n\nThe answer is, of course, YES!",
