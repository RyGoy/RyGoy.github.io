   "message": "Mike Lamb: Identify yourself.\n\nSince you spoke up, now's as good a time as any to address Captain Kirov's concerns. Captain Kirov reads this group via the Lou Manotti account, in case you didn't recognize the name. ;)\n\nIt was pointed out that you share MANY of my articles but take the time to strip my name off the share. This means you are interested in spreading what I have to SAY, but you don't really want to be associated with ME.\n\nYou have TWO completely useless occupations that don't actually PRODUCE anything useful, which probably means this group is the most exercise your brain has had to date.\n\nUnfortunately that sort of thing is almost a perfect infiltrator's cover. Infiltrators NEVER pose as someone in a field that actually PRODUCES VALUE, as it is too easy to out the posers. Actors and DJ's, on the other hand will NEVER be \"outed\" for being fake... that's their job.\n\nI know false positives occur when such analysis is applied, which is why I do it out in the open for all to see. No secret shit here!\n\n...SO\n\nSpill it. Who are you and what are you doing here?",
