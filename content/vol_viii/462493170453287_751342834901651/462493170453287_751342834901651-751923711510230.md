   "message": "Uri Gellar is a PERFECT example of this phenomenon. James Randi exposed him REPEATEDLY, yet people still believe in Uri Gellar's \"powers\", because HE \"believes\" or appears \"believable\".\n\n Damien Duffy revealed in his last post that he was cherry-picking what I say. It is beyond his comprehension that ALL of what I say is true. He would rather slap \"belief\" on it, than accept that ALL of what I say is true.",
