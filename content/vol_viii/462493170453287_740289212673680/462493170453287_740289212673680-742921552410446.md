   "message": "I think I've proven sufficiently that you completely choose to ignore the significance of the word THREAD therefore confirming that you are a fucktard for at the very least not acknowledging your MISTAKE. A mistake is acceptable, asking forgiveness is sometimes necessary, but choosing to be a fucktard...not so much. IGNORANCE is a choice. You've clearly made yours and you STILL THINK WRONG :/",
