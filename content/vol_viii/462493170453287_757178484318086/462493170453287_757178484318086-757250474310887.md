   "message": "I LOVE the invocation:\n\n \n[After seeing commissioners walk out on him] Duly noted.\nOur collective atheism � which is to say, loving empathy, scientific evidence, and critical thinking � leads us to believe that we can create a better, more equal community without religious divisions.\n\nMay we pray together.\n\nMother Earth, we gather today in your redeeming and glorious presence, to invoke your eternal guidance in the universe, the original Creator of all things.\n\nMay the efforts of this council blend the righteousness of Allah with the all-knowing wisdom of Satan. May Zeus, the great God of justice, grant us strength tonight. Jesus might forgive our shortcomings while Buddha enlightens us through His divine affection. We praise you, Krishna, for the sanguine sacrifice that freed us all. After all, if Almighty Thor is with us, who can ever be against us?\nAnd finally, for the bounty of logic, reason, and science, we simply thank the atheists, agnostics, Humanists, who now account for 1 in 5 Americans, and [are] growing rapidly. In closing, let us, above all, love one another, not to obtain mythical rewards for ourselves now, hereafter, or based on superstitious threats of eternal damnation, but rather, embrace secular-based principles of morality � and do good for goodness� sake.\nAnd so we pray.\nSo what?",
