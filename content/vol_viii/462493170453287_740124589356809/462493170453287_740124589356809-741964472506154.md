   "message": "Membership generally falls into two categories: freemen and liverymen. One may become a freeman, or acquire the \"freedom of the company\", upon fulfilling certain criteria: traditionally, by \"patrimony\", if either parent were a liveryman of the company; by \"servitude\", if one has served the requisite number of years as an apprentice to a senior company member; or by \"redemption\", upon paying a fee. Most livery companies reserve the right to admit distinguished people, particularly in their sphere of influence, as honorary freemen. Freemen may advance to become liverymen, after obtaining the freedom of the City of London, and with their Court of Assistants' approval. Only liverymen are eligible to vote in the annual election of the Lord Mayor of London, the Sheriffs and various other City civic offices, including the Ale Conners and Bridge Masters.",
