   "message": "\"In Canada, Chartered Accountants belong to the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (\"CICA\") by way of membership in at least one provincial/territorial institute (or order in Quebec). In order to become a CA, a candidate requires an undergraduate degree plus experience and, depending on the province, additional education. Candidates in all provinces are required to pass the 3-day Uniform Evaluation (\"UFE\"). As of January 2013, Canadian CA's have adopted the CPA (Chartered Professional Accountant) designation. Now CA, CGA and CMA (all three accounting bodies in Canada) are in process of unification.\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Accountant#Canada",
