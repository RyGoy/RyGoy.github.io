   "message": "OK, so one of these dumb-ass threads, I made the mistake of setting up a SKYPE call, where I had various group members in, asking questions, getting answers and yelled at. It was quite the success.\n\nSince then people are messaging me asking if I RECORDED it. I laugh at their negligence, and presumption. :D\n\nThey then ask when the NEXT one is. It appears there might be a demand for this shit! So if you want to make it a weekly thing, I will do it.\n\nAll that's left is to choose the day. CHOOSE WISELY!",
