   "message": "The Mother and Father were only married in a statutory act {if}.  There is not a Lawful marriage under statutory code.  That makes the child a [bastard], which brings in more problems.  The two adults on the RECORD are considered to be chattel property of the STATE. My understanding is the child is then the evidence of an illegal act making the child now a THING which is property of the STATE. Why else would you need to ask permission to do something? Unless it is illegal and requiring a license.",
