   "message": "Apparently legislation has been drafted in Ireland that will require single mothers to name the father on the birth cert. \n\nIt's being sold as a good way for kids to know who their real father is etc...\n\nTheres obviously an omitted agenda behind it. Any thoughts?\n\nAre people authorised to divulge personal information other than their own? Or is it just more fraud?",
