   "message": "From TORONTO. To good to be true folks...read this article. It takes a brave man to beat another man who is handcuffed and defenseless. So let me see if I am understanding this Admiral Scott...it is okay to make a mistake as long as you COP to it :D  This thug reported the crime to a superior, did not try to cover up his actions, wrote a letter of apology to the victim and pleaded guilty which equals showing remourse and taking responsibility for one's actions. \n\nAnd the best part is that this thug had long disciplinary record including but not limited to 3 assaults and pleading guilty to discreditable conduct.    \n\n�We want you to come forward when you make a MISTAKE, so we don�t have the problem of police officers going underground and doing all the horrible things we don�t want them to do: falsifying reports, going to trial and lying under oath,� -Ontario Court Judge Howard Chisvin.\n\nNote to JUSTICE Chisvin: They already do ALL of these horrible things. A couple weeks ago we saw precedence of Justice's using the surety of the PERSON and this week we have thugs making MISTAKEs. So much precedence available for administrating the person we have :D",
