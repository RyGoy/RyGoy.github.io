   "message": "Admiralty Maritime Law/Banks deals with MONEY, meaning SURETY and ACCOUNTING, therefore \"LEGAL.\" It's own jurisdiction. \n\nCanon Law/Catholic Church does not deal with \"surety and accounting,\" there is no LEGAL. And that has it's own jurisdiction. \n\nTrust Law/Nobility is the highest form of law, then Canon Law, and thirdly Admiralty Maritime law. Each form of fraud, I mean law, has their own \"game\", with their own \"rules.\" One jurisdiction cannot tell another jurisdiction what to do. \n\nI hope that helps, David-Paul Sip.",
