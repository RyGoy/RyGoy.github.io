   "message": "Maximus Legis, yet these stories from \"her\" are all hear say, right? I mean, is not like you were a witness to anything. \n\nLet's say, for the purposes of this discussion only, that this \"woman's\" story is true. Why would you trust/entertain talking to a complete stranger, desperate for money, talking shit that you admit did not made sense, then send a photoshopped fraudulent document to Scott for his scrutiny, to then say you knew there was something wrong with her, yet still you did all this? :/  What was  the motivation, and intent behind your actions? What did you stand to gain for doing all of this?\n\nIf there was a sexual motivation, which is my kind of motivation (I am weak in that way, :D ) or a monetary, or acquiring knowledge. But just from the details given, you stay you had nothing to gain.\n\nI am really trying to understand why is that I have spent part of my Sunday in this crappy story. :/",
