   "message": "Scott Duncan I really wanted to get the info you started talking about. I dont know how many people listening/learning you feel is enough VALUE for your time, but please start it all over add people one by one so we can id the guilty device/listener... I know my cell phone did ruin one call. I promised to never cause this again. I know how it feels to feel guilty for it. Is it possible a device, even muted, could cause noise without the listener knowing ? Im not on the cell btw. I have a feeling tonights call was going to get into some very important info :(",
