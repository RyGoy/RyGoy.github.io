   "message": "From Mike Jones :D\n\n\"Why don't you show up in the group?\"\n\nThat's a dumb question, Pete. I was a member until I was banned for asking too many questions, trying to verify what you and John claimed about the Income Tax Act, and otherwise continuing to think for myself.\n\nPS. I have made Mirabel aware of the cases http://canlii.ca/t/fnk4t and http://canlii.ca/t/g8zcf and encouraged them to contact the bailiff and locksmith so they may know how to counteract any potential \"terror\" or other harm induced by Denis's improper and illegal PPSA processes. Perhaps when he is assessed thousands in costs, like your member Gail, you will finally consider you might be doing it wrong and learn better.\n\n@Chris Evan, \"why if someone defaults on an obligation do I have to take them to court so the court can decide if I am right when that isn't the burden for the IRS?\"\n\nThey do not have to follow the standard laws of contract because all citizens, residents, corporations, even stateless individuals with no birth certificate as long as they are in the area claimed by Canada, are considered participants in Canada and subject to Canadian legislation, such as the Income Tax Act, that dictates how they can affect those persons.\n\n:D",
