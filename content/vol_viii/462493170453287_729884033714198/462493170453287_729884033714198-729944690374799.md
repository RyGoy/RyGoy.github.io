   "message": "Fuck, they got the bills of exchange, but they did send an account statement with interests/penalties added 3 months ago... No reply to my last 4 communications... They wont return my call or even pick up the phone, it's always a fuckin voicemail... \n\nSo now here I am preparing another of those long communications loaded with FACTS to force them to send over a zero'ed account statement... The fuckin mortgage \"lender\" will be asking for this, so I need it ! \n\nPlus I want PROOF so all the other fucktards start obeying the law with no fuckin around, and so I can show others that it's indeed how it's supposed to work.",
