   "message": "Happening in Quebec...\n\nJust to make a short resume of my friend Denis's shit...\n\nDenis use to run a business named Amusement 911 Inc, that business was specialized in repairing old pinball machine, and arcade games.\n\nDenis had in stock ALL these obsolete parts to repair these machine, he had that business for 15 years, and had a pretty decent inventory.\n\nIn 2008, the building where Denis had his business went on fire, the whole building burnt down, and, of course, Amusement 911 Inc had NO insurance for that, so Denis went crazy a bit for a while, he�s been trying to collect the landlord insurance, he is still working on that case, anyhow, that event put Denis in a very bad position financially.\n\nHe tried very hard to keep up with business, but without his inventory, it was impossible.\n\nSo in 2011, he decided to start a complete different business, he started Camera 911 International, he registered that one, it�s not a INC, but a REGISTERED name. He supply cctv shit...which has nothing to do with pinball shit...\n\nRevenue Quebec Agency keeps sending DEBTS to Amusement 911 Inc, since 2008, Denis told them, and supplied proof, that the business burnt completely, ALL the papers and everything, and he keeps telling them to fuck off�but of course, QRA invented a debt of 80k, and sent it to Amusement 911 Inc, Amusement 911 Inc is still alive because it might collect something from the lanlord�s insurance, Denis can�t close it for that matter�.\n\nAnyway, the Baillif who takes care of that 80k, decided that Camera 911 International was Amusement 911 Inc, and he decided to come to Camera 911 International, to seize 80k of stock.\n\nCamera 911 International and Amusement 911 Inc has 2 different addresses, and that tard showed up at Camera 911 Registered, to seize stuff in regards of Amusement 911 Inc.\n\nWhen he showed up, Denis told him he was at the wrong address. The bailiff didn�t listen and wanted to enter the place anyway, Denis said NO, the bailiff called the cops.\n\nWhen the cops arrived, Denis didn�t even had the time to pronounce one word, and he was arrested :D , so They brought Denis to the cop�s shop, to finally bring him back home, after 2 hours. (Denis yelled for 2 hours, WHERE IS THE SURETY) even though Denis has an arrest warrant on his person for one unpaid ticket (He used the surety of the person to discharge that ticket), he wanted to show them the proof that the debt was discharged, but they didn�t want to talk about it, they just wanted to get rid of Denis, for some reasons :/\n\nIn the mean time, that bailiff hired a locksmith, and entered Denis�s place to take an inventory, he then named Denis�s person as the GUARDIAN of the inventory, (without Denis�s authorization of course)  and said he would come back in a month with buyers to sell this stuff�he came back, but the cops didn't want to ASSIST him this time, so he had to go back home, with his 20 buyers.... :D HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!\n\nOf course when Denis got back home, I was there waiting for him :D\n\nToday, after having followed the step by step method, that bailiff has a $5 million dollar lien to deal with, so as the cops, and so as the locksmith.\n\nIn a couple of days, this will be published in the newspaper, the baillif�s order will receive a copy of the lien, and he won�t be able to practice baillifery until he fix that shit�.\n\nDenis asked twice for the cop's bond, and the baillif's bond, they refused to supply it....\n\nThe city of Mirabel is already investigating�. (Denis was really sharp with the Notice of Claim) He did explained WHY and pointed out everything....no one rebutted.\n\nAnd the locksmith is going bananas�. :D\n\nI wonder if some LAWYERS will get in the way !!! :D\n\nSteps:\n1). Notice of Claim.\n2). Invoice.\n3). Notice.\n4). Default Notice.\n5). Liens.\n\nTo be continued� :P",
