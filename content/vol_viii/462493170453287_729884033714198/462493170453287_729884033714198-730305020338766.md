   "message": "Received in private from Mike Jones.... :D\n\nRe: Your friend Denis and his million dollar fees.\n\nWhen the law is broken the courts decide what is reasonable compensation. You can't just make up numbers, they have to be recognized as reasonable by the courts, either as dictated by statute or decided at common law. Considering Denis suffered little to no damage from an unauthorized inspection, the damages awarded likely wouldn't be much.\n\nFurther, liens are not the way to recoup damages for such violations. Denis needs to bring a lawsuit as the person or company violated. Liens are also not how you enforce alleged contracts. You have to sue in court.\n\nSnap out of the freeman bullshit.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour friendly neighborhood law examiner",
