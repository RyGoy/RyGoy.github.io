   "message": "As I said, it wasn't so much fear as it was inexperience. Not having the right questions or replies ready to hand because you don't know what they're going to throw at you... \n\nWhile leaving I thought, that went ok as it's on the record that I am not EAMONN O BRIEN. The more I think about it the more I see that it didn't go too well... I thought getting out of there with my wallet intact was a victory. \n\nI'll deal with the fine when it comes...\n\nI'm still not surety :D",
