   "message": "@Pete, why would you feel the need to reserve your inherent rights? You already have them.\n\n'Cause I'm guessing you're not looking to reserve THEIR rights, are you? If your paperwork clearly identifies THEM as Trustees, you would then be reserving the rights of Trustee and thus, be reclaiming the surety. I hope that makes sense.\n\nIn my opinion, that is being double minded as it could technically be an action which counteracts the notice of mistake, if one was submitted.\n\nI'd would invite you to simply stand on the fact that THEY DON'T HAVE in personam jurisdiction.\n\nOne question - What evidence do you have that I volunteered to be a citizen, subject or employee under the authority of YOUR jurisdiction?\n\n@David-Paul, they can only proceed if you allow them to - \"POINT OF ORDER, there is an unanswered questions before this court - What evidence do you have that I volunteered to be a citizen, subject or employee under the authority of YOUR jurisdiction?\n\nTake charge, grow some fucking balls and let them know you mean business\n\n;)",
