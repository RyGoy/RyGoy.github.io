   "message": "It's easy to type, but is not the same when one is in front of \"all mighty government god.\" \n\nOne thing it got stuck on my head was the whole \"The Master asks the questions. The servant answers/responds.\" You see, it was clear to me that we have been trained to be in position of servants. It's bad to question things, more so if it's questioning a figure of \"authority.\" \n\nIt is weird to respond to a question, like if you were in Jeopardy. But \"I've got it.\" \nJ: What's your name?\n Me: Are YOU addressing ME?\n\nThat thing. ^^^ If I make the questions, I am in control.",
