   "message": "Good thread. Thanks for sharing your experience Eamonn O Brien.Anyone would be nervous taking the helm of a ship in shallow harbour for the first time if all you ever did was read about it.  What Steeve Contributing Beneficiary  says above makes sense to me with exception to what David-Paul Sip added about AGENCY and presumption *If, you haven't formally resigned already. Still it does seem to be a presumption? No one ever told me about it other than Scott so asking for EVIDENCE of AGENCY appears fair. Clearly there has been no meeting of the minds.  I didn't notice Scott Duncan correct any of that. How do we keep the Justice in the TRUSTEE role? Is asking questions of the court enough? Is there a specific way of asking for these roles to be maintained beyond what SCB stated?",
