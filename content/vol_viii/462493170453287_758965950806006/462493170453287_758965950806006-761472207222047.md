   "message": "There's not much mention of freemen on the land here really. They have next to no credibility to be mentioned. Republicans is a label attached to southerners who sided for the treaty granting Ireland a legal status under the crown back in 1921... The south is known as the Republic. It's a legal title... People don't know that though. They think we fought and won our freedom from 1916-1921...\n\n(Not that there's not much credibility for \"freemen\" but not alot of people are out there applying it... Only a few of us in The Tender for Law here. The only solid resource for law)",
