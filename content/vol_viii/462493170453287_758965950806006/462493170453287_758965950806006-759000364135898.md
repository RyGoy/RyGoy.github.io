I should have asked \"are you addressing me?\"...\n\nWhen he stated that he wouldn't talk to me because I wouldn't give a full name I should have said by refusing to talk to me you will be accepting surety do you wish to not talk to me? Or something like that... Easy now to think of once I'm sat in the comfort of my home...",
