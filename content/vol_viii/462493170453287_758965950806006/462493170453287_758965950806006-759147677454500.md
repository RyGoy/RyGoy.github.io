   "message": "I didn't know how tolerant he would be before ordering I be taken away... I just about got \"by what authority\" out... I know he should be the one worrying about my tolerance but again, fear sets in...\n\nI should have pushed more for him to read my affidavit and paperwork. Spent time putting it together. \n\nGoing in one doesn't know what situation they will be presented with. Couldn't get passed the name...\n\nDoes the fact that a courtroom full of people saw the judge establish that I wasn't EAMONN O BRIEN count at all Scott?",
