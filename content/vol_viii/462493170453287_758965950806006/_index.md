   "message": "Just back from court. \n\nName was called, I said I was here on that matter. My name is Eamonn and I'm here by special appearance....\n\nJ: What's your name?\nMe: My name is Eamonn \nJ: So you're Eamonn O Brien?\nMe: No, my name is Eamonn today, nothing more, nothing less.\nJ: But I won't speak to you unless you tell me your name.\nMe: I've said, my name is Eamonn. By what authority can you tell me that is not my name? I'm administrator for the Eamonn O Brien account.\n\nJ: What does that even mean?\nMe: It means I'm in charge of that account. I have paperwork filed in the case file if you want to view it.\n\nJ: (Tells guard/cop/plaintiff to read out the facts of the alleged offence)\nMe: I also have questions for the court and until they're answered I can't understand the nature & cause of these proceedings.\n\nJ: So you're not Eamonn O Brien?\nMe: My name is Eamonn. I can give Eamonn O Brien into custody of the court if you'd like?\n\nJ: (Asks another Guard to call outside the court for Eamonn O Brien)\nMe: For the record, if Eamonn O Brien is not in the room then clearly I am not the Eamonn O Brien you are looking for...\n\nJ: So you're not Eamonn O Brien?\nMe: No I am not.\n\nJ: Then I'll just have to fine Eamonn O Brien ï¿½250 and give him 1 month to pay.\n\nI grabbed my coat and walked out...\n\nI started out alright but fuck me did I start shakin! Was great to see the judge squirming a bit once he couldn't get past the name... I know there could have been plenty of questions for me to be thinking of on the spot but trying not to shake really got in the way of my thought process...\n\nThanks to Lee Edgely for coming down. I also knew another guy in the court so there are 2 witnesses that are eligible to affirm that it was confirmed on the day that I am not Eamonn O Brien... No doubt there'll be more paperwork down the line... There is still no evidence that I am surety...",
