   "message": "You got it Pete - Mr Justice WHY are you NOT answering the questions? What are you hiding? Are you perpetrating a FRAUD here today? Is this an honorable court?...\n\nOn the whole being surrounded by Sheriffs thing, I've been there and done that too. As long as you make it clear that YOU DO NOT CONCENT TO BEING PHYSICALLY TOUCHED IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM, they will not touch you.\n\nIn fact, a friend of mine did that and had the Justice YELL at the sheriffs/bailiffs to NOT touch my friend after expressing that in court.\n\n\"DO NOT TOUCH HIM!\" - he actually yelled it out. To me, that's fascinating. In my experience they'll just circle you and stand there, waiting to see what comes next.",
