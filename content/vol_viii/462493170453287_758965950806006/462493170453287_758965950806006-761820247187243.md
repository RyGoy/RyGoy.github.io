   "message": "I don't get why ppl bother going into court if you have not had any practise??? Like wtf ... gather with some friends and have the best one play the judge. Simple go In and do it like how you wish to. He'll even have a guy there standing close to you as the guard. I did this at seminars and even thoe I played the judge ... ppl were still nervous. Once you do it over and over u become relaxed and not as tense. I always say ... if fear kicks In. ..read from a script or at least have a few responses to use in case you freeze up. . Ffs... it's easy why yall go Inn there and make it harder for the next guy... judges use ur fuck ups as case law ... duh so stop going in so stupid ... or at least get a contract with the court before you enter. Are you John doe .. do you not know who your looking for ?? Is there a problem with me being here as a interested 3rd party who has a vested interest in the person in question.... judge: what is ur name ... you may refer to me as a friend of the court or defendant ... refer just means you will take it under consideration only ... doesn't anyone anyone how to talk to the damn judge -?????
