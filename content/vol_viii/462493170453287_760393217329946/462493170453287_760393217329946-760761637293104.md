   "message": "Here you go Mackximus Minimus:\n\n \nDan Wilson How can I lie about something so well known? Scott promotes notice of mistake, liens, trusts, etc etc. \"Lawful remedies\" very much akin to the notices and liens freemen do, and I'm telling you this serves NO PURPOSE and in fact is simply playing with fire, dipping in and out of surety. Why would a judge set you free when you clearly don't know how to get out and stop touching their shit?32 mins � Edited � Like\nDaniel J Wentz Scott promotes no such thing. Stop lying.33 mins � Like\nDaniel J Wentz In the past 4 years he has taught 1000 people how to make their own currencies and banks. He has shown how to get out by destroying money.\n\nMy own ship is debt free because of him. What do you do? Who benefits from your lies?...See More28 mins � Like � 1\nDan Wilson If you claim rights you're done. If you say \"I wrote this\" you're done. They control all law, all PAPER, all fiction. You have no claim for damages. You have no grounds for an invoice. Any superior position you THINK you have THEY OWN. IT'S ALL THEIR LAW. Wake up.23 mins � Like\nStuart Stone So Dan Wilson, what is your solution?\n\nYou say that our ONE move is to opt out...yet offer means by which to achieve this end....See More20 mins � Edited � Like � 2\nDan Wilson Why do you need a NOTICE on paper under THEIR law when you can simply NOT respond to the name? You can opt out any second you feel like it no matter what exists or doesn't exist on paper. Like I said, your freedom is INHERENT, NOT lawful. So stop playing with paper bullshit like it matters.13 mins � Edited � Like\nStuart Stone In what context? \n\nIt is my understanding that their game is based upon presumption...how do you plan to rebut the presumption if/when you are, for want of a better word, assaulted and/or kidnapped?...See More15 mins � Like � 1\nDaniel J Wentz Yes, I should ditch all I have, because of Scott Duncanbecause this schmuck says he's got the answer. Fuck you.14 mins � Like\nDaniel J Wentz Oh my! Look at Stuart Stone! 13 mins � Like\nDan Wilson \"we have not been paid for the value added to the person\" What? They created a person, you used it. You get what THEY decide to give you for it, period.11 mins � Like � 1\nDaniel J Wentz Actually that part is true.10 mins � Like\nStuart Stone \n\nI used to race yachts offshore...the golden rule (besides one hand for the boat, one hand for you), was only step UP into a lifeboat.\n\nMy ship seems pretty robust so far...and no Dan, I'm not seeing your lifeboat dude.10 mins � Like � 1\nStuart Stone Which ties back in with the joys of dicovering that, when we create our own currency, we get that lovely warm realisation that we have no value...(you're right Dan, their currency has no value either)\n\nbut still Dan, there is a question still hanging:...See More7 mins � Like\nDan Wilson They might dismiss a case when you file some such Notice or whatever, but while you operate under those laws or make any other lawful claims they have discretion. The less you claim the more free you are. The Notice of Mistake could be used as a courtesy but it should be understood to have no binding lawful effect and there are more subtle ways to clue the judge up that you're wise..6 mins � Like\nDaniel J Wentz He will lie through ommission that you are PRESUMED to be using the name in its LEGAL capacity. NOTICE must be given so they have a record of the intent. \n\nOnly liars from the government, and Christians, think it';s OK to demand respect for their juris...See More5 mins � Unlike � 1\nDan Wilson Which is greater, real or fiction? Why \"must\" the real give notice to the fiction? It is fiction that must beware the real.3 mins � Like\nStuart Stone Hang on, you just stated that the only way is to opt out of their system...and now you're talking about judges (sic) justices...so which is it, in or out?\n\nThis isn't a 16 year old girl in the back seat of a van on a Saturday night Dan, so which is it, in or out? or once you're in (using the context of your judge comment) are you later going to claim that you were date raped?\n\nBut again, we digress...there is still a very obvious question still left unanswered:\n\nBut more importantly, in this context, what evidence do you have, besides the laughable Meads v Meads drivel, that Scott Duncan could possibly fall under the category of a Freeman on the Land?2 mins � Like\nStuart Stone and another one...just for fun:\n\nDid you ever use the moniker Fukyiropinion?",
