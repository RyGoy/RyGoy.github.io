   "message": "Dan Wilson appeared. He keeps lying about Scott Duncan in a post where Scott Duncan's work is being passed off as someone else's.\n\nI don't speak up often, but I'd better see a lot of people making a lot of noise there. Scott Duncan doesn't really care about being lied about, however I care when people do it to him.\n\nWhy don't any of you?\n\nIf you can't answer that, let me spell it out for you: You don't pay for this. Earn your keep. You owe a debt to a man who dares to tell you the truth. He asks nothing in return.\n\nWhen someone you owe a debt to, is slandered, or libeled, you speak the fuck up.\n\nI hope I am making myself clear, because the next step is to direct the ever-diligent Pete Daoust to ban anyone who was too apathetic, duplicitous, or just plan cowardly to speak up.\n\nI've watched pieces of human garbage like this, attack Scott Duncan for 40 years. No more.\n\nYes, i knew Scott Duncan at 8 years old.You can see why this is a bit of a sore point for me.",
