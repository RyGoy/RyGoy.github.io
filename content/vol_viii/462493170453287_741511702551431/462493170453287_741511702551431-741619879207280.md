   "message": "After the first time they've brought me in front of the justice, they pulled me out of there in a rough fashion, and that cop made it very clear that he was not happy with the way I behaved in that court, I literally told him to pull his gun and to shoot me in the head if he's not happy.....and I told him to fuck off.....\n\nI was awarded for that with a 4 hours in a isolated cell, with my jacket on, chains on my wrist and chains on my legs, at 90 degres celcius :D\n\nThen they brought me back in there for 8 seconds... :/\nI just had the time to say, if me or anyone else led you to belie\n\nThen in prison, in the FF wing... :D",
