   "message": "In western Canada,  rcmp and city cops all want to hit nails with their hammer badge and special powers ( special like in special Olympics)  you just don't want to be a nail for special person with hammer badge. \n\nBeing polite, questioning the process and having them on their way the faster possible is to my opinion the best idea.
