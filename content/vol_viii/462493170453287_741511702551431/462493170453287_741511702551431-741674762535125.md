   "message": "I was talking about this kind of thing tonight with maybe the only man in Nova Scotia that I can talk about this and not be looked at sideways. We agreed one should never protest anything at the scene with an officer. When he was asked for his licence he responded with \"I would be happy to give you the property of the crown you are referring to\".. he said the officer responded saying \"oh, arn't you liberal?\".
