   "message": ".\n. . . . . . \"Once upon a time there were a lot of stupid people and they were folking and had lots of children who grew up and were also stupid. So then there were more and ever more stupid people who learned how to feed themselves and not shit in their beds.\n\nSomehow a few of them were smarter and the smartest ones \"declared\" to the stupid ones that the smartest fellas owned everything and all the land under everything because the mother of all gods gave it to the smart fellas to take care of. The smart fellas called this \"divine right\".\n\nSome of the stupid people (especially the fellas) were convinced (gifts and \"privileges\" were involved) by the smart fellas to help the smart fellas intimidate, dominate and thus control the rest of the stupid people. They were called police, clerks, lawyers, politicians, agents, bishops, priests, ministers, monks and snipers. This system was known as feudalism or slavery.\n\nThe smart fellas found out that some smart nerds invented writing, numbers and weapons and realized that they could use writing and numbers to more easily control more stupid people. This was called Accounting and Surety (and Religion). The smart fellas generally only used the weapons on the smart asses who figured out their game or refused to play along.  . . and this was called Policy Enforcement.\n\nThe smart fellas created certificates, mortgages, licenses and money. The money they encouraged the people to use to trade among themselves with and pay taxes to the smart fellas. The smart fellas also created the banks to store the money the people weren't using and to further control the stupid people by secretly and openly creating more money without most people noticing.\n\nIf any people got smart and created there own money the smart fellas would harass, kidnap, torture and/kill them to keep competition for control and wealth to a minimum.\n\nThe smart fellas had children of their own and traded the females off to other smart fellas on other land who had also \"declared\" that they too owned everything and by the same methods controlled many slaves themselves. In this way the smart fellas spread out around the world mostly worked together with the occasional attack and robbery of other smart fellas' Accounting and Surety games.\n\nThis worked really well for the smart fellas even though some had declared that \"slavery is abolished\" and the \"people have rights\" because the people still \"believed\" that they were free and that the smart fellas had \"divine right\" given them by the same god that the people \"believed\" existed but was invisible and didn't answer their frequent begging for help or relief (there were fees charged by the clergy for such begging).\n\nThe stupid people \"believed\" all was well and the smart fellas \"knew\" all was really really well . . . for the smart fellas.\n\nOne day, seemingly out of nowhere, some smart-ass, shit disturber invented a computer software device he called the Block Chain.\" . . . \n\nTo be continued . . . .  \n.\n.\n.\n.",
