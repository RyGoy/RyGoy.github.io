   "message": "Other than depositing/filing the security with the court (previously, before going to the hearing) I would not whip out that Birth Certificate in court. A presumption is created if you are found in possesion of a security that belongs to the government.  Like being found in the possesion of cash, at the moment of being detained/arrested.\n\nI someone asks me about a birth certificate, I would reply: \"What is a birth certificate? Are you trying to attach information from a public document to me?\" But, that's just me.",
