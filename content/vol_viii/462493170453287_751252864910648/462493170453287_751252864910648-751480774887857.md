   "message": "OK, Quick tips. I bounced this one off The Fender, because he sees the whole Legal Matrix at a detailed level I dread having.\n\n1: You have no contract with a COLLECTION AGENCY. The Collection AGENCY, IS the AGENT for that DEBT, though. IT'S THEIR RIGHT.\n\n2: DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEBT, THIS ALLOWS THEM TO CLAIM THEIR RIGHTS (which is why you reserve ALL rights in any communication), and you walk in LOSING.\n\nPete Daoust always says he has a PERSON in his pocket, but what KIND of \"Person\"? There are MANY kinds of PERSONS!\n\nPete Daoust would be better saying \"I HAVE A LEGAL ENTITY in my pocket\"! ...an entity for which HE is not the principal. The TRUSTEE on your Birth Certificate is the principal. In MY case, it would be the GOVERNMENT OF ONTARIO, which is an AGENT for the GOVERNMENT OF CANADA.\n\nPete Daoust has a LEGAL ENTITY (Fiction) in his pocket. He is the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for that LEGAL ENTITY. When he SIGNS, he is BINDING THE PRINCIPAL, who is THE GOVERNMENT OF QUEBEC, an AGENT of the GOVERNMENT OF CANADA.\n\nNone of you got my AGENCY article, did you?",
