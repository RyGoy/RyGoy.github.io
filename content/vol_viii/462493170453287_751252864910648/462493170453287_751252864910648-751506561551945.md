   "message": "...just checking.\n\nPiece-of-Shit Christians lurk here all the time, because deep inside they know that they are just delusional adults with imaginary friends. They hang out here (the only source of ACTUAL truth) because they discovered a LONG time ago, that their imaginary friend can't actually TEACH them anything, and that Jesus gets the credit if anything NEW seeps in.\n\n...so they lurk here, and look for truth that doesn't upset their imaginary friend, all the while thinking \"That Scott Duncan is gonna burn in hell! Truth is blasphemy so he will suffer, and I will take his truth and credit jesus\"! (Yes, they REALLY THINK this way!)\n\nThat is why I endorse violence against adults with imaginary friends; They exist to harm others.",
