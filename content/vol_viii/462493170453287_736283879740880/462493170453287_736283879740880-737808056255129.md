   "message": "Laurent VH, I missed your question: How does the corp uses that VALUE to create money of account then?\n\nThe deposit of the BoE is now Money of Account...simple, it gets more by getting more bills, then more fiat, then more bills....it could be a never ending spiral.\n\nAlso, The corporation goes to a CPA, in Canada, its called a Chartered Accountant, I'm not sure what its called in Belgium though...You have them perform the accounting, and you need some kind of certified book value. I think they will simply certify the Balance Sheet, which would account for the money for their jurisdiction. Then you go to a bank and ask for a private banker....they will most likely beg you to give you fiat.",
