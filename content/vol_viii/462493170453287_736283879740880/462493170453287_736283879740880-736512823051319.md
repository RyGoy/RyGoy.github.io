   "message": "Here I'm coming back again with the \"FOR DEPOSIT ONLY\" thing... Sorry if I sound really dumb :(\n\nWhy do I have the impression that a DEPOSIT seems to be something that cannot be withdrawn / has to be kept on account ? That once you withdraw the funds, it could no longer be considered a DEPOSIT ??\n\nWhen you write those words on a cheque, does that mean the bank MUST KEEP the original instrument ??? If so, then it seems, indeed, that any money of exchange available would be something totally independent from the DEPOSITED instrument and wouldn't be REVENUE...\n\nIn such a case, it seems it wouldnt be REVENUE for as long as the INSTRUMENT is DEPOSITED. \n\nThere's no synonyms in law... So if I'm right thinking withdrawn DEPOSITED funds no longer are a DEPOSIT, and we know invoices can be SECURITIZED (right ?), and SECURITIES can be DEPOSITED...\n\nIs it possible that you could withdraw a DEPOSIT and replace the funds withdrawn with SECURITIZED RECEIPTS, or BIlls of Exchange or any other SECURITY, DEPOSITED, keeping the accounting even ???",
