   "message": "OK. Here in REALITY, most of you dumb chimps are too stupid to even know what MONEY is, muchless what the BANK OF CANADA is. The government KNOWS this, and therefore borrows from PRIVATE/CHARTERED Banks. The banks must lend ACTUAL money that they don't have, so they BORROW it OVERNIGHT, from the Bank of Canada, and pay it BACK with all the \"loans\" they made, the day before.\n\nCITIZENS are left holding the bag.\n\nIn the United States, the banks are more efficient. They simply TOOK OVER the Federal Reserve. Americans were too ignorant to notice.",
