   "message": "I KNOW the Acts, Codes and statutes better than anyone else. It's why I \"invested\" in them. It is like a race-car driver buying a fast car. He has the skill to get the MOST out of what he bought.\n\nImagine how pissed off he'd be if 4th gear threw the car into reverse and the engine flew out of the hood?\n\nImagine how much WORSE it would be if the dealer started saying it was the drivers fault for not knowing 4th gear sometimes shifted into reverse!\n\nWell the same thing happend with me and \"law\".\n\nThat's why you even know I exist.",
