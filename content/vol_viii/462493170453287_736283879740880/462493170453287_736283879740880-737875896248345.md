   "message": "Laurent VH, when you LIEN the person, you use a corp. to do it, and the reason to do this, is you choose to use ANOTHER person to do commerce with from now on, which is the corp. that liened your person.\n\nSo all bills you asked for, should come in the name of that corp., because that is the person you use to do commerce now.\n\nAnd if a bill arrives under the name of the person that has been liened, it will definitly be a PUBLIC DEBT :D .\n\nSo the corp will keep that debt, add the value of it to its book, because the NAME is liened by the corp, and will make a photocopy of it, and send it to the registrar general so he can settle the fuck up :D\n\np.s. Verify that shit, I am not too sure.....PIERRE DAOUST hasen't been liened, so far.... :D",
