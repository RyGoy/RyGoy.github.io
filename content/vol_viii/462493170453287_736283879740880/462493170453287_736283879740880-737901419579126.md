   "message": "It depends on what scale you are looking at:\n\nIf you are asking if you are stupid, compared to ME, then Yes. ALL of you have stupidity that burns matchsticks at 5 paces.\n\nIf you are asking for context for my previous post, then I am talking about Chris.\nChris is not asking stupid questions. His questions reveal he's stupid. This comes as a result of PRETENDING to understand something I taught EARLIER. People often put \"placeholders\" in those concepts and move on. This is the result.",
