   "message": "For the benefit of the \"law\".\n\nThat's what separates me from the Free-Dumbers; I PAID FOR THAT LAW, AND I DID NOT GET WHAT I PAID FOR. They don't follow the rules anymore. The Tender For Law, which Fiat Currency provides, is in fact, FRAUD.\n\nIf you rip ME off, I destroy you. The rules are simple.\n\nI was ripped off, so I am going to LEGALLY and LAWFULLY collapse the banking system and start a war.\n\nI'm not saying anything NEW here. Where did I lose you?",
