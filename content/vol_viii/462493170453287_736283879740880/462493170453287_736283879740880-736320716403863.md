   "message": "For my clarity - When we use legal tender it's a BENEFIT and the use of this BENEFIT implies that we have requested it and this imports a promise to PAY for this benefit. Therefore we gave up our consideration for this benefit back to Bank of Canada and this is why we have no ability to create credit. Due to our own ignorance we screwed ourselves over in exchange for a Benefit based on Debt.  This means we have all given up our ability to create CREDIT to BANK of Canada and that was our exchange for the use of debt notes...is this correct?  and would the valuable consideration we rendered for this be found in section 57.1 of the BIlls of Exchange Act?",
