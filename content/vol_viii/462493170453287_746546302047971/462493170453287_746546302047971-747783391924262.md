   "message": "Benefits that \"appear\" to be \"free\" will cost elsewhere, and usually more.\n\nIn a cost/benefit scenario, which is more valuable and to whom?\n\nTo the mule that pulls the cart, the carrot may seem to be a benefit.\nTo the farmer the carrot is a small price to pay to move the cart of carrots to market.\n\nThe mule if wild could be grazing and not work nearly as hard.\nIf there farmer had no beast of burden to pull said cart, would require a more expensive way to get his product to market or fail.\n\nNO GOV \"benefit\" IS FREE!!!",
