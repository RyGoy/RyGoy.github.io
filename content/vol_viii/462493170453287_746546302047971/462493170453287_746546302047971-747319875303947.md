   "message": "FCC Title 2 of the Telecommunications Act.\n> Title II ï¿½ Common carriers\n\n\"At the crux of the debate over Net neutrality is Title II of the Telecommunications Act. The section, which is more than 100 pages long, regulates how common carriers must conduct business across all forms of communication in order to act \"in the public interest.\" Net neutrality supporters say that the language is vague and could be used to sidestep a free and open Internet and give ISPs the opportunity to sign deals with Internet companies that would provide for prioritization of traffic.\n\nObama, however, said that the FCC should limit some of the regulation relating to rates and \"other provisions less relevant to broadband,\" creating potential wiggle room for further debate on the limitations.\"\n\nhttp://www.cnet.com/news/president-obama-calls-on-fcc-to-keep-internet-free-and-open/",
