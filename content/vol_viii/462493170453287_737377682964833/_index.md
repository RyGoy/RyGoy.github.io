   "message": "Admiral Scott Duncan, US and Canada have common law, and the law of estates. You have spoken about TRUST, and the mechanics of operating in that realm, in that jurisdiction.\n\nIn CIVIL LAW jurisdictions, there seems to be something different with the mechanics of TRUST. Or maybe I am wrong? I cannot put my finger to it. :/\n\nI have been researching information about TRUST here, but everyone wants to send me to a lawyer. \n\nWhat is different here, Admiral?",
