   "message": "Todayï¿½s show is focused on Bitcoin and the world of cryptocurrency. No one owns the Bitcoin network except Bitcoin users around the world, making it a quintessential peer-to-peer technology innovation. It means the payment system does not include a middle man and has zero or low fees, unlike our current system that uses bank and credit card companies. \n\nThough Bitcoin has gained increasing acceptance as a payment platform, the currency value has seen a thunderous move up followed by a massive collapse. Is bitcoin a bubble? Does it have the ability to change the world? Take a look at what our panel of guests, including Max Keiser, John McDonnell, and Reggie Middleton, had to say about the future of Bitcoin.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcwauLnVdOg",
