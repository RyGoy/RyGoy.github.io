   "message": "Again further...about monetizing these securities...I am not sure. But, some banks will create shell entities to hold a bundle of these things, then sell the shares at par...that could be an option.\n\nI think there is a market within Private Banking that will buy these things, but I am not sure I really want to sell them...or exchange them rather.  I am hoping they wish to receive a share of stock for the term neeed as a valuable consideration for the exchange.  \n\nI am nor sure about any of this, but I know this is what other banks are doing!",
