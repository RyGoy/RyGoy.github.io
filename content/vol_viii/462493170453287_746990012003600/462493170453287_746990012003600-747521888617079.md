   "message": "Chris, question on this....\n\n\"I think there is a market within Private Banking that will buy these things, but I am not sure I really want to sell them...or exchange them rather. I am hoping they wish to receive a share of stock for the term need as a valuable consideration for the exchange. \"\n\nWHY would you offer a \"share of stock\" for \"exchange\"?  The consideration should be the \"things\"; not a share of stock.\n\nCorrect my thinking here....",
