Have you seen this? https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205383465014392&set=p.10205383465014392&type=1&theater\n\nTo me, in REALITY, it boils down to how much harm I want to inflict me, and/or my family. so my options must consider this. I already know there IS slavery in place, so what is the price I am willing to \"pay\" to prove that?\n\nIf that LAW of AGENCY is in place, then my beef has to be with the PRINCIPAL, the MASTER! My \"employer.\" Who the fuck cares in the Tax AGENCY if the man does not want to buy any more public debt? They cannot do anything about it. That sound like something that needs to be heard/solved by the PRINCIPAL. It should be able to do something about it. \n\nDoes this ^^^ makes sense to you, Pete?",
