   "message": "Ok, here it is�.\n\nI give power of attorney to 9111-1111 Quebec Inc, to take care of PIERRE DAOUST�s administration.\n\nBecause, Obviously, I CAN�T do it my self, and no one will tell me WHY :D\n\nThen, when a bill is picked up in PIERRE DAOUST�s mailbox, well that bill will be brought directly to 9111-1111 Quebec Inc.\n\nSame thing with �money�, if money is sent to PIERRE DAOUST, for ANY reasons, well that money will be brought to 9111-1111 Quebec Inc.\n\nNow, 9111-1111 Quebec Inc will PAY these bills, by keeping the originals, and make photo copies,  and will have to send PIERRE DAOUST a statement of account, with a remittance voucher attached to that statement (same shit we receive) to PIERRE DAOUST at each end of the month, because 9111-1111 Quebec Inc needs to balance its books.\n\nThen this remittance voucher will be turned into a Bill of Exchange by �ME�, and will be sent to 9111-1111 Quebec Inc, it will be done EXACTLY the same as I am doing right now.\n\nThen, 9111-1111 Quebec Inc will go see his Chartered Accountant, so this guy can verify if everything is true, and will then CERTIFY that bill of exchange. (this step was pulled right from my ass, because I think it�s a logical step, I will know soon if it�s true)\n\nAnd then, 9111-1111 Quebec Inc will deposit that Bill of Exchange, with its Private Banker, at the CIBC, because this shit seems to need to stay in PRIVATE. (This also was pulled right from my ass, we�ll see as well :D )\n\nOf course, PIERRE DAOUST�s security is NOT damaged, in that scenario\n\nI wonder HOW many �persons� 9111-1111 Quebec Inc can ADMINISTRATE like this� :D\n\nThese are NOT legal advices, it�s for entertainment only\n\nBy: ME\nAll Rights Reserved / No Prejudice\n\n:D",
