   "message": "I do not think Revenue Canada can answer the question of surety, being that the ORGANIZATION was NOT the creation of that AGENCY/Revenue Canada, but ANOTHER AGENCY.  Why would we ask that question to RC/IRS, I am still debating about it. Maybe the question should be made to/answered by the creator of the security/organization? Still, I do not think they will put it in writing. It's like putting in writing a company secret. Why would they do that?\n\nOne of a few options is, other than administrating that BILL, for the AGENT to forward those BILLS to it's owner, which is the PRINCIPAL. It is JOHN BARRET that owes. JOHN BARRET is the PROPERTY of the PRINCIPAL.\n\nThe government is a TRUST, but it's operation is via AGENCIES. That LAW of AGENCY cannot be ignored when dealing with government.",
