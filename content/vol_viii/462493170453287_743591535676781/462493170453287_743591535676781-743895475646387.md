THOSE are the only variables you need to worry about.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nIf we say your time is of VALUE ($T=VALUABLE TIME) and you set the variable $T to represent that concept, that is it's ZERO STATE, it has no value because no TIME is applied. Therefore $T=0\n\nTHE PAST (-P) does NOT exist. It is ONLY A RECORD and is NOT REAL ANYMORE. Since it does NOT exist, then $T= $T +(-P) = NEGATIVE BALANCE. That VALUE goes elsewhere; and usually it's the parties who caused you to INVEST time in the PAST.\n\nThe FUTURE (+F) doesn't exist YET so time spent THERE is an investment that you will COLLECT. THEREFORE $T=$T + (+F) = PROFIT!\n\nIt's not the VALUES that matter, but the simple mechanics of ACCOUNTING.",
