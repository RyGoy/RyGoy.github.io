   "message": "I watched IOUSA. The part about the country borrowing money by selling bonds/securities helped my understanding of money...\n\nWithout people a country is just a geographical location. With people it's a geographical location that can produce value so Governments had to monetise people in order to have something that represented value to sell... The security known as the person and the value contributed to it...\n\nThus explaining why it's bad to contribute value to the person as it provides fuel for a corrupt government.... \n\nIf it's hard you're doing it wrong... ;)",
