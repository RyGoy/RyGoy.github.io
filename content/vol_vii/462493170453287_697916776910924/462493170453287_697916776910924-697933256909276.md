   "message": "Great work as always Scott Duncan. The only question that arises after reading this is the last line, where you say\" A Bank note does not tender surety\". Forgive me, but wasn't this the basis of the argument between you and the \"freeman on the land guy\" who's name escapes me at the moment? Not Dean, the other guy. My understanding after reading all of that was by using money/ bank notes that we are accepting a binding tender for law? Please clarify any misunderstanding if you will.",
