   "message": "Peanut butter theory anyone? \nHe started the WFS. (We're Fucking Stupid)\nFleeced it for what it was worth and left it to die.\nNow, he has a facebook following that are as stupid.\n\"Master of confusion, should have been a lawyer.\"\nDefinitely morally bankrupt enough to fit in with those sacks of shit!\nCon man, fraudster, shyster, crybaby when called out. \nFuck, how I loathe him! \nOff to the dungeon with him.\nThere he can work on his newest theory in private.\nI bet he will claim to have come up with Dungeons and Dragons, but his cell mate stole the idea from him.\n(I remember him calling out for precious jewels so he could encrust a book that was to be the Holiest of Holy for the WFS. What a fucking shyster sack of shit you are Menard.)\nThink Free forum called him out on his claim of right.\nHe ran away and formed his own gold mine forum.\nI could go on, but I am about to have dinner.",
