   "message": "I am about halfway through reading a book titled \"Banking and negotiable instruments\" by Sir Frank Tillyard, and I have a question. Hopefully someone here might be able to help me with it.\n\nThe chapter I am currently reading is about personal security, or collateral, and it is covering letters of credit, bonds, etc.\nMy question(s) are, can a person, issue a bond against the surety (Bank of Canada via the Birth Certificate) to another person (corporation) that can then be deposited into a trust? Would that trust then be able to declare it as an asset of the trust and borrow against it to perform whatever day to day obligations that the trust may have?\n\nIs this how to move my person into the private trust realm and out of the public/government realm?",
