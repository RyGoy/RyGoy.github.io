   "message": "THOUGH it PURELY serves MY AGENDA, I am constantly reminded of the VERY PERSONAL way I affect some of you.\n\nMany of you either privately, or in this case, publically, will post testimony as to how I have somehow profoundly altered your view... \n\nIt takes me by surprise EVERY time. There isn't a \"profound change\" for me. No \"guru who showed me the way\". No \"seeking the path to enlightenment\".\n\nI don't HAVE any of these experiences. Ever. I know they are real, but they aren't something I've experienced. \n\n...so I forget about its existence. Until the NEXT time, I see/read a testimony about how I have done this very personal and profound thing.\n\nI honestly have no idea how to respond to it. :/",
