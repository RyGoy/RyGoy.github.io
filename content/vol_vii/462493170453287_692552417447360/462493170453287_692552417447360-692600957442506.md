   "message": "Well, folks here can answer that better than me.  All I have is a private, biased, subjective opinion.  Nothing else.  And that opinion is that more folks are gradually \"waking up\" and sifting through all of the misinformation and then you have those few (which is growing) who are truly grasping the core truth, in turn, increasing the \"number\" added to this particular \"Facebook group\" and other \"groups\" where folks can comfortably converse, argue, and debate topics; interactive with others who wish to re-program their brainwashed heads...\n\nunfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), within those \"growing numbers\" you will experience the presence of some beings who simply do not have a \"life\" and/or obviously have \"issues\".\n\nThat's just the way it is.  Sure, one can ignore, dismiss, or even shoot these zombies, but there are LOT of them.  I just make a \"note\" of who they are, avoid them, and stay focused on task at hand.",
