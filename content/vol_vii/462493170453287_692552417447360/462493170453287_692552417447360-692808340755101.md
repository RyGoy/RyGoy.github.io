   "message": "On Wednesday, a youtuber by the name of \"wake up to the new world order\" posted a video about the new money grab at Deanclifford.info. For $40.00 you can order the Victoria seminar. \nThis \" wake up to the new world order\" poster proclaimed that he was going to release this seminar to everyone for free to choke off all moneys to Deanclifford.info. \nThere was a video also on Menard that same day from \"wake up to the new world order\" that was not very flattering as well. \nNow, both videos have been removed.\nToday, some shithead is having night terrors and Menard is still clueless to the facts.\nI wonder, who could this \"wake up to the new world order\" possibly be?\nAny guesses?",
