   "message": "These free-dumbers lie. That's all they do. They don't DO anything else. They don't care if they are \"exposed\" any more than the government does.\n\nWhatever the retard comes up with, he will consider it a \"victory\". Do you not see that his ONLY motivation is to stop people from hearing the truth?\n\nYou waste time doing that shit. Menard actually produce a lie worthy of response.
