   "message": "As far as \"property taxes\" go... would not one BILL for the maintenance of the city's part of the property, such as upkeep of the lawn and maintaining the snow/ice on the sidewalks? Would that not be worth (in labour) approximately $6000 of credit per year? \n\nWe do not work for FREE? Correct? Since that is what fiat monetary system is worth, our labour/time?\n\nAlso in that respect, could you not bill, then lien said property for the time you have spent on this said upkeep? Scott?",
