   "message": "Yeah, like everything else, I have to research this further.  It is ironic, because I do not \"sign\" checks.  I stopped doing that a couple years ago.  I simply write ONLY DEPOSIT REAL LAWFUL MONEY TO ACCT # - So, I may have been doing that incorrectly then.  One interesting thing the audio mentioned was the \"signature card\".  I do not get \"paychecks\".  All of that is direct deposit, so I need to go to payroll and review what I have on \"file\" with that dept.",
