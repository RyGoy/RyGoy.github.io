   "message": "Can anyone pull this apart for me.  I welcome all criticism.  I came up with this after a long discussion with freedumb indians trying to demand there human rights from the government by petition.  I told them to stop wasting their time and do something constructive.  Like figuring out what joinder is.  \n\nThis is in regards to so called treaty rights.\nSo called Indians and retards who think the court gives a shit about any rights.  The government holds our lands in trust under the various treaties.  It doesn't have to honor those treaties any longer for the simple fact that the decendent of the signers have all been assimilated and integrated.  Meaning there are no longer any people who can reserve treaty rights.  You are a Canadian citizen first and a signatory treaty person second.  So the group or race of people who can reserve treaty rights technically don't exist.  They have been assimilated by joinder thru birth certificate and if there was any wiggle room the Indian act was created to flush it out.",
