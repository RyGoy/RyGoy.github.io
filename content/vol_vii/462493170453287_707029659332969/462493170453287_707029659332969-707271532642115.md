   "message": "IF the loan was securitized, the Bank has no Standing to foreclose IF they are only the Servicer of the loan.  If the loan was \"securitized\", the only rights the Bank has is that of the \"trustee\".  The Bank can ONLY transfer what they possess, which in this case, would be that of the Trustee.
