   "message": "Tracy, it may not be as hard as you think.  Look at your loan documents, specifically the ones you signed at closing.  Look at the Deed of Trust and at who is listed there.  \n\nThese loans are monetized into Trusts.  You can look for your loan number, by the Bank name on the NYSE.  Oops....New York Stock Exchange and look for a Trust close to the date AFTER your loan closed.  \n\nThis is a little late in the game......file the bankruptcy first if you want to fight to save your home.  That will give you time to dig for the information you need.",
