   "message": "\"...footage of the tragedy has emerged as a character in its own right, stoking public outrage, shaping legal tactics and raising questions about the power of technology to shape the relationship between governments and the people they govern.\"\n\n�Increasingly, the public is aware that there is a serious police failing in this area. And they�re now getting a first-hand view without the filter of a police account or the filter, frankly, of lawyers.� -Julian Falconer\n\n�Most of the time when people have been killed by police, there aren�t witnesses other than police, and bystanders who don�t see very well . . . Police officers don�t often testify against each other . . . so there might well not have been charges had there not been a video.� -Peter Rosenthal",
