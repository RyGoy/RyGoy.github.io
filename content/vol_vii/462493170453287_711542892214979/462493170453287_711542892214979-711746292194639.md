   "message": "Regarding NAFTA and The FEDERAL Court located next to the Prime Minister's Office,Ottawa (Nota Bene. -. The Corporation of the City of Ottawa is located on unceded Algonquin native land) \n\n\"The Dicey doctrine is the foundation in case law of how authority made their/ your own citizens into enemy combatants. This started by oppressing those Irish because they were disloyal subjects and it was applied onto the rest of England in order to oppress union rights [for example] In Canada the atrocities of our Native Residential schools were modeled on basically the same premises as Dicey's Irish Residential School system at that time.This case law of creating a contract court to execute official policy of the governor in power became the foundation of what Hitler did to handle his undesirables AND frankly the Harper Regime (current Canadian Prime Minister) is repeating the same tactic by giving the FEDERAL COURT jurisdiction to rule over 'those classes of persons' under s-55 of the CDSA [aka - Harper's undesirables] This Dicey doctrine was applied across England as 'quasi-legal' in order to uphold contracts that the government entered into with banksters who [for example then bankrupted England with WW1 debts which instituted those quasi-legal MARITIME COURTS-[S 15 CC Obedience to defacto law}\n \nThis uncodified case law was used in in order to impose this quasi-legal court system onto Canada under the Colonial Act AND then in 1933 when the IRS bankrupted the USA which converted the citizens into enemy combatants and this was fully codified as a North American \"POLICE STATE with NAFTA 1993.\n \nAfter 25 years of entrenching this POLICY under the Charter [UK Canada Constitution Act] has resulted in a situation where all Public officials are expected in law to be in direct violation of their oaths in order to do their job. So their solution was to make all oaths meaningless in the 1988 POLICE ACT AND it's all made possible by \"we the people\" accepting that this is the way it always was.We've become automatons of misery and it's all caused by fraudulent public debt [Jefferson]\"\n \nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/225921602/Dicey-Doctrine",
