   "message": "Scott told me on the phone once that the District Attorneys have one job...to ATTORN me out of my natural SUI JURIS status and into the jurisdiction of the DISTRICT.  Of course it has taken me 2 months to think of this next question, but....what DISTRICT?\n\nIt occurred to me that Massachusetts has counties, Towns, Cities, all of which are encompassed within a State.  But, there are no DISTRICTS. So which DISTRICT exactly am I being ATTORNED to?  As I think about this, I notice the DISTRICT of Columbia and the 12 Federal Reserve DISTRICTS. The DISTRICT of Columbia is in fact synonymous with the UNITED STATES.  As we know, \"these notes shall be obligations of the UNITED STATES\", so we have the SURETY.  The Federal Reserve of course, provides the ACCOUNTING, along with the IRS which uses the ZIP Codes for their DISTRICTS. \n\nThen, I started thinking about your CROWN Attorneys.  WTF exactly is the CROWN to which they attorn you to?",
