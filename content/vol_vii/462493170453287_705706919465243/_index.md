OFF TOPIC POSTS WILL BE PURGED. We want people to be able to use this as a central reference and a place to go for help, where people will take the time to do so.\n\nPost any questions on LAW, MONEY, CONTRACTS, and JURISDICTIONS and how they are connected.\n\nKeep it civil, even if Scott doesn't. (It's Scott after all. Seriously, it's better than paying him) Remember that Scott chooses his words carefully. LEARN WHAT THOSE WORDS MEAN.\n\nAnd when your examination of these things is done, you will see that we also have a REAL SOLUTION to the problem. YOU CAN'T BUY that shit ANYWHERE! :D\n\n...no really.
