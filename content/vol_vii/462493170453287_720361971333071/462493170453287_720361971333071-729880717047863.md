   "message": "What is interesting is he completely contradicted himself and this MEADS ruling (which I should read) from what he said \"There is no separation between the man and the person\". :o Instead of calling me Mr Sip or David he had DAVID PAUL SIP paged and DEEMed DAVID PAUL SIP to have not appeared lol! Judge me by my actions not by my words. His actions (by paging the NAME/PERSON) demonstrated that he said was not recognized is TRUE :/",
