   "message": "A funny thing with this Tom McKeogh was when I asked for his NAME after he DEEMed the PERSON to have not appeared he answered \"You haven't told me your name so why should I tell you mine?\" I responded \"Because YOU are required to!\" He then told me his named and even made sure I got the spelling correct too. Interesting how I informed the court that I do not consent to being called by any PUBLIC NAME and NEVER not once did the justice call me anything but SIR :/ Even after quoting \"Meads vs Meads\"...so yes fairy tales Chris Evan",
