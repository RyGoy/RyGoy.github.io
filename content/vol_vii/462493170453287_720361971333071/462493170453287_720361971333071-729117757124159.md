   "message": "So you have discussed before Scott the concept of 'Doing Business As.' If one gets a lawyer, they automatically become a ward of the court. A ward of the court is considered an infant, or one of unsound mind/an incompetent unable to handle their own affairs. They are always so eager to appoint you duty counsel if you are unable to afford a lawyer, which would seem to be an act of CHARITY then by them for helping these poor 'vulnerable' out in need of representation because they dont understand the law.\n\nIs The Law Society of Upper Canada really 'The Law Foundation' Doing Business As The Law Society of Upper Canada, and why any money you give a lawyer is put 'in trust' because they're really a Foundation?",
