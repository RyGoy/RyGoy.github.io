   "message": "Pete ADMINISTERS his PERSON, because CIVIL LAW makes it beneficial for him to do so.\n\nCOMMON LAW has no OWNERSHIP RIGHTS. It works on the DOCTRINE OF ESTATES. That is why I get ANOTHER person to TAKE OWNERSHIP of my PERSON.\n\nI do not endorse or agree with Pete's methods, even though they are essentially correct. He will remember this as a \"phase\" he went through, 10 years from now. ;)",
