   "message": "Funny !!! :D  ....I am all fucked-up now, I'll stick to: I am a Man, and I have a person... :D\n\nMinority:\n a term for people in a predominantly Caucasian country who are not Caucasian, including African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, indigenous Americans (Indians) and other people supposedly \"of color,\" despite the irony that the majority of the world's population is not Caucasian. Sometimes the term is employed to include women and homosexuals. \"Minority\" carries with it a certain patronizing tone even when used to assert rights of peoples who have been discriminated against, either socially or by law.",
