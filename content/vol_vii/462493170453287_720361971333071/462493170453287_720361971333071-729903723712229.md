   "message": "So let them tell me that Mackximus Minimus. I never said I would not pay but I need them to clarify what my right is regarding the SURETY. I either have the right to the SURETY of the PERSON or I do not. If signing the drivers licence made me surety then they should have no problem to say so. Capitaine Pete's question is a good one and it must be answered. The Captain thinks SURETY can also be used in traffic court and I wish to confirm this.",
