   "message": "\"Asking the question of SURETY negates the possibility of understanding. If one does not understand, one must not proceed.\" Mackximus Minimus This is what is supposed to happen and yet depending on the \"Justice\" they may proceed without you. \n\nI will post on this in more detail later but my recent experience in traffic court was similar to what Gail Marie expierienced with the \"Justice\" referring to \"Meads vs Meads\" and then contradicting himself by having the name/person paged DEEMing that DAVID PAUL SIP was not in the courtroom. This despite 1) ME informing the court that I am the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for the person DAVID PAUL SIP 2) I am a MAN and have the person and use the name and 3) there being a question before the court regarding SURETY (Can I use the surety of the person to discharge this public debt, or am I automatically surety because I have shown the driver's licence?)\n\nIt seems that the courts BELIEVE that the opinion from Justice ROOK gives them the authority to ignore questions they deem to fall within the MEADS vs MEADS ruling. It seems that the standard to make this interpretation is very broad.",
