   "message": "Ok, first of all, let me clear something. I never said to point out  \"I am NOT the NAME\".\n\nSecondly, the question of SURETY will always be present, regardless of who the MASTER of the SLAVE is. \n\nThe NAME is a SLAVE, and the NAME has a MASTER (government). The MASTER is there to take as much VALUE from that SLAVE.\n\nWhen you OFFICIALLY RESIGN, by placing a LIEN on the NAME/SLAVE, and holding that VALUE in TRUST, now YOU are the MASTER of the SLAVE. Is no longer the \"government.\" A new PERSON you TRUST can help you administrate these affairs.\n\nThe question of surety will always be there, is who is in control of the NAME/SLAVE what is different. If you are in control, you have not only better chances of an outcome, but you may be entitled to some money, if someone insists in doing business. Just like the \"government.\"\n\nDid that help, Icbeonne Senama? :/",
