   "message": "OK, now let me make you look stupid...\n\nI TRUST Tara Duncan implicitly.\n\nIn all the wonderful years that trust has existed, I don't recall engaging in \"trust business\".\n\nPerhaps you know more about the TRUST I have with Tara. Is there \"secret commerce\" occurring, which I have yet to be informed of? If so, why do YOU know before me?\n\nThese questions are moot, because, you are, of course, an idiot.\n\nThat is my position on \"TRUST BUSINESS\" and anything YOU think is just bullshit you are making up.",
