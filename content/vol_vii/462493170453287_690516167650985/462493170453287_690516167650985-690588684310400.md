   "message": "Seriously Chris Evan, play it total ignorant, first I'd go to the bank and try to get this through over the counter... Of course that psycho customer of your landscaping company sent you a bunch of instructions in writing with that bill of exchange, right ? Bring all that psycho crap to the bank.\n\nIf they wont, send the bill of exchange to the bank registered mail with every possible question and a copy of the psycho customer's letter... Try to either make it go through or have them tell you WHY they wont, but cover ALL ANGLES !\n\nIf they refuse, send the whole shabang, psycho letter, your letter to the bank and their answer, to the FED, say the bank wouldnt help you, you dont understand because the law says you MUST present it to payment else the psycho is free, so you really want the payment for that bill which is probably gazzillions dollars, and that psycho guy seems to actually be telling the TRUTH, so you dont understand why the bank refused...\n\nYou want answers from all them motherfuckers !\n\nFuck is this place getting entertaining or what !?",
