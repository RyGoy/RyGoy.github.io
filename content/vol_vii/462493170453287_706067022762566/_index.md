   "message": "There is/was a post about \"Jason Moreland\" being allegedly arrested/charged. I cannot see that thread now, because the one that posted the thread either BLOCKED me, or left/deleted his Facebook account, after I made him a simple question: (\"Profile name\" that I cannot remember now), are you Bildo Schmildo? \n\nThe account in question was created just one day before posting the \"Jason  Moreland\" thread. Bildo Schilmo was the only friend this other profile had. Bildo is friends here with the accounts of Chris Evan, and Dean Clifford. \n\nWho the fuck is this guy posting all this out of the blue? Anyone has the profile name? Can anyone still see the thread?\n\nI am just letting everyone know what is going on.",
