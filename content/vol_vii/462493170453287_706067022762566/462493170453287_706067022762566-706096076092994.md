   "message": "You speak/type as you have been here before. You were added by Scott just last Friday. You drop in with allegued charges about Jason Moreland, you publicly say to contact you, if any questions, and then you decide to delete the thread because \"It did not seem that the thread was producing anything of value\"? Really?\n\nWhenever a thread is gone, with all of our comments, is like being stolen of something that belonged to all in the group. I think it was a relevant thread. Even the Admiral had given some input. YOU posted the information/thread, so it must had been important. So, why delete it?\n\nYou  never answered the question if you also use the account of the name Bildo Schmildo.  Who are you, and what are you doing here, Simon Templar?",
