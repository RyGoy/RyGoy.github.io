   "message": "The thing here Captain Pete is that, unlike yourself, Simon Templar has \"joined Facebook\" in Friday, August 8th 2014, magically requested to join the group that same day, drops in a quite controversial manner, and fails to answer basic questions, then deletes the thread,  I mean... really? Who is this character? :/ \n\nSimon, you still have not answered. \n\nDeleting threads also creates other problems. The alleged \"evidence\" that Simon, at least partly, bases his decision to delete the thread is now gone. <<It did not seem that the thread was producing anything of value. Specifically, the last three posts related to someone's choice in venue for sexual relations.>>  \n\nThere is no way to verify this now. Almighty Simon took the decision for US of to decide what actually had VALUE, or not. (Whatever the fuck he really meant with that). If there was any knowledge in that thread, he TOOK IT away from US. What a presumptuous fucktard.",
