   "message": "Private message received from Will Zewe...\n\nWill Zewe\n\nHey man i know you don't like private messages but I just wanted to ask to be accepted back into the tender for law. It's the only page I check daily and I don't comment or say anything because I'm still very new, learning, and a lil nervous to comment and say something that'll get me banned. I go back and read through the comments and posts Scott's made as much as possible as well as trying to keep up to date with the ongoing processes you guys are doing like with Quebec hydro and yourself. I would really like to be accepted back and remain a member. If you guys want me to show that I'm listening and reading and actually putting in effort to earn my worth I can definitely ask questions and like more things to show I'm there and listening. I have some questions about OID's that I've heard about. Id just really like to show you that I am trying to learn and TTFL really is the only source on Facebook I've found so far that's telling the truth and how it really is unlike the freeman crap.",
