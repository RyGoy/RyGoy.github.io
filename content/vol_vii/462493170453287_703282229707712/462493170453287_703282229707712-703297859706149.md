   "message": "So any bill addressed to the legal person would that be considered a public debt? NO :/\n\nAnd we have the right to surety of the person as evidence by whose signature is on the birth certificate correct or out in left field? NO, because it says it in the Quebec charter of Rights and Freedom, at article number ONE. it also says it in ANY fucking rights and freedom document.....\n\nAlso your saying because hydro Quebec kept the bills of exchange you sent to them their conduct implies that they've accepted payment yet they won't tender the debt? Their conduct implies that they are HIDING something, they are in BAD faith and Breach of Trust....and they are definitely LYING to me.... :D",
