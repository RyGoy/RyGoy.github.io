   "message": "Thank you very much man I appreciate the addition once more. So any bill addressed to the legal person would that be considered a public debt? And we have the right to surety of the person as evidence by whose signature is on the birth certificate correct or out in left field? Also your saying because hydro Quebec kept the bills of exchange you sent to them their conduct implies that they've accepted payment yet they won't tender the debt? (If I'm out to lunch feel free to set me straight lol).",
