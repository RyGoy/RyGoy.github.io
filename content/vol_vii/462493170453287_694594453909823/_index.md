   "message": "Here is a bit of a twist on the \"Gas Bill\" thing.\nI got home and this was hanging off my door knob. (see pic)\n\nThe \"service\" to be disconnected is the meter presently on this house however we do not have any account and it has been dormant for several years.\n\nI called and asked what it would cost for hook up and monthly fees etc.\n$25.00 application fee + $0.35 per day rental of the meter + gas usages at rate.\nI told her to mail to the house a contract offer stating all fees.\n\n\"The only thing that uses gas in this house is the fireplace and today was almost 40C degrees\", I told her. The house is going up for sale before winter and we want the equipment here for the next owner. She said if we want to keep the meter we have to apply for service. She also explained when they remove the meter, they cap it at the main, for \"safety\" so it will be very expensive to re-install it.\n\nI asked her if this was a \"Pay me now or Pay me later\" scam. :)\n\nIt really irks me but if I contract with them and then cancel it one day later I am on the hook for around $35.50++ and I don't have any stamps either. :(\nBy applying, it will give the new owner a couple of years to decide if they will use it or not and wont effect the sale price of possibly thousands.\n\nOf course, there is the principal of it all but until this house is sold \"the show must go on\".\n\nI should add, there should not be any problems with the meter as it was swapped out in 2013 and has not been used.\n\nUnless I can find a way to delay this action until the sale, I see no other choice. Oh Bother! :(",
