   "message": "Hahahahaha! Watch your speed when driving the Interestate through  South Carolina everyone. I have a STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA UNIFORM TRAFFIC TICKET from 2012 pinned to my office Board. The ticket included a SUMMONS for the PERSON to attend a trial in January 2013 but  the PERSON was in Canada by then so that was not possible. I even attempted to ADMININSTRATE by calling to speak to the officer. I left a message for him to call me back which he never did. I have not heard from the State of South Carolina regarding this matter so I'm not sure what this means lol! :/",
