   "message": "I'm still pretty new to the whole Tor network browser, but noticed this today as I am reading over the latest from Infowars.com. I know that its a popular browser amongst everyone I know, but I have only been using it for a short time and am still working out the kinks to it on my end. I am only a beginner c++ programmer, and still learning the use of the language as well. I have used Linux (Slackware, Mandrake/Mandriva, Red Hat) in the past, and am thinking about switching my Mac over to Ubuntu or Mint in the near future. \n\nAny thoughts on the article? \n\nhttp://www.infowars.com/almost-everyone-involved-in-developing-tor-was-or-is-funded-by-the-us-government/\n\nI don't really get a lot of time to spend on here, but I have been reading all the nuggets (and idiots articles, which are very informative by the way. thank you on those. I would rather read something I can learn from than, drab bs or other non-relevant material.) that I have saved to my (cheap, pay and talk) phone, which I usually read on my way to work on the bus in the mornings (and on my breaks).\n\nThanks in advance for the input.",
