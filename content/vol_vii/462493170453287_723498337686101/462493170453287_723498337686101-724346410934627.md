I emailed them and this is what they said:\nIrish Water Customer Service <customerservice@water.ie>\n\n22 Sep (3 days ago)\n\nto me\nDear Mr Edgely,\n\nThank you for your email regarding Irish Water.\n\nIrish Water is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bord G�is �ireann which itself is owned by the Irish State. Irish Water is a separate subsidiary within Bord G�is �ireann. The Government have explicitly stated that Irish Water will remain within public ownership. There is no intention to privatise water services. The investment in the water sector is key to our country�s strategic interests and legislation will restate the existing prohibition on the privatisation of water assets. The sale of Bord G�is Energy will have no impact on the public ownership of Irish Water.\n\nIrish Water is the new national water utility that will have responsibility for the delivery of water and wastewater services to homes and businesses.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.\n\nYours sincerely,\nWilliam Preston\nCustomer Service Advisor\nUisce �ireann\nBosca OP 860, Oifig Sheachadta na Cathrach Theas, Cathair Chorca�, �ire\nIrish Water\nPO Box 860, South City Delivery Office, Cork City, Ireland\n\nT: 1890 278 278\nMinicom: 1890 378 378\nwww.water.ie",
