   "message": "Hey, my 80 year old dad opened the \"Your Irish Water Application Form\" that he received to his home last week and threw the envelope in the bin. Can I still send, 'ABANDONED PROPERTY RETURN TO RIGHTFUL OWNER and / or SENDER' in the return envelope Irish Water enclosed, back to Irish water? Is there another method to negate CONTRACTUAL JOINDER since I don't have the original envelope? Thanks",
