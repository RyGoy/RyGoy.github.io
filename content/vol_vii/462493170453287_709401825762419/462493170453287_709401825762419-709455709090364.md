   "message": "Pete Daoust Ok, what have you done in the REAL LIFE, with what you love in here ? \nSince I seconded the above.....\nI quit my \"job\" and started a LLC,\nI ordered and read 2 textbooks on contract law that Chief recommended.\nI got myself set up into crypto-currencies and set up a mining rig\nI'm up to about 2000 hrs of reading from the Tender for Law posts and files section.\nI've got a new gig lined up to work as an independent businessman with another independent businessman.\nI've written out my TRUST and will be getting it notarised and making a public NOTICE this week.\n\nI am sure there is a lot more I could add to this list, but I am getting tired and I will probably think of it when I lay down...\n\nSpeaking of tired though, this group sure has had an effect on my sleeping habits because I cannot seem to turn by brain off and sleep like I could before.\nHahaha! :)",
