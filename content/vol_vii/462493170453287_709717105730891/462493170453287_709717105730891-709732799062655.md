   "message": "First correction is that the state of Deleware that created this new LLC. Not a man and not your PERSON...the fucking STATE OF DELAWARE. The shareholder information is none of their business since it is privately held but you could tell them that no shares have been sold/issued to date so there are currently no share holders.  Of course they will want to know what PERSON has signing authority for this entity. This will require a resolution passed by the board (also known as administrating) authorizing your PERSON to write checks or make withdrawals. A man must still supply commercial energy to this entity. There is no escaping that.",
