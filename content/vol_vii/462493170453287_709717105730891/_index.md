   "message": "Question in private from Adrian Thomson....\n\nPete, If I may ask you a question please... After I have incorporated, a Delaware LLC, how do I open a bank account for this new company without linking it to the person in my pocket? I was in to a CIBC here in Nova Scotia, and they want shareholder information, but I don't see how I can show them that it is the MAN that created this thing, not the PERSON. Do you have any thoughts on that?",
