I just wasn't thinking clearly at the time, and was being rushed by my wife to travel into town.\n\nI fully expected that I was going to be berated because I knew I had fucked something up somewhere. The original message being private instead of a proper post is simply one more in a long string I had going that day...\n\nBut I'm back on track now.\n\nAnd thanks for not pulling any punches.
