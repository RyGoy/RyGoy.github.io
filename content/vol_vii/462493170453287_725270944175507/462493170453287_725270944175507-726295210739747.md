   "message": "These completed Instruments were sent to the IRS to be deposited in exchange for a tax credit. Legal Tender is just accounting, right?  So....the bank it was deposited in is the Treasury. The voucher is a 1040-v which is a taxable credit for SGMI. (For those who don't know, SGMI is a person I use for commerce. It has taxable liability) The instructions were to credit the social Security Account. I sent 3 of these in mid July to early August. So, its been over 60 days on 2 of them, and I haven't heard anything. :-/",
