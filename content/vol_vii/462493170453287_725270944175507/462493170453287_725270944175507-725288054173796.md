Have 9111-1111 Quebec Inc PAY the bill, and then 9111-1111 Quebec Inc sends a bill to Pierre Daoust, and I turn that thing into a complete bill of exchange, so 9111-1111 Quebec Inc deposits this in its bank account.\n\n3). I, as the sole authorized Admin for Pierre Daoust, take a vacation, temporary transfer the administration duty's power to RogueSupport Inc, so Roguesupport Inc pays that bill, and sends a bill to Pierre Daoust, so I can settle that RogueSupport's bill with the SURETY of Pierre Daoust !!! :D (So I can have an idea of what kind of fees to charge for doing this :P )\n\n4). Have them cancel that bill :(\n\n5). THIS SHIT IS SO FUCKING FUN !!!!! :D\n\n6). Offer 1160 dogecoin :/ (It would hurt my heart if they would accept that :( )",
