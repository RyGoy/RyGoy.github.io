   "message": "As most of this stuff does, that Act reads like a bunch of gobbledygook. However, the most interesting part was scrolling through the 'regulations' of the Act:\n\n�discretionary interest� means any estate or interest in or possibility of receiving income or capital of a trust that is dependent on, or the value of which may be increased or reduced by the exercise of or the failure to exercise, a discretionary power held by the trustee or trustees or by any other person or persons and, for greater certainty and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a power to amend the terms of a trust or a power to determine the date at which all or any interests shall vest or at which all or any property shall be distributed is a discretionary power;\n\nMore specifically; who exactly holds this \"POWER\" mentioned about in this definition, Scott?\n\nhttp://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/regu/sor-84-431/latest/sor-84-431.html",
