This is a forum for SHUT THE FUCK UP AND READ.\n\nThe fact that you think you have ANY ideas I haven't means you did not bother to participate in the aforementioned SHUT THE FUCK UP AND READ, policy.\n\nThis forum exists for one thing: MY AGENDA.\n\nIt is not your own little recruitment centre for your ad-hoc ideas. I actually have the answer. I don't want yours. You aren't qualified to have an opinion on the subject.\n\nYou WILL be qualified, if you SHUT THE FUCK UP AND READ!",
