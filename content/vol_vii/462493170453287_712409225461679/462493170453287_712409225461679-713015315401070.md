   "message": "The sole authorized administrator has no INTEREST in the NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT. All questions should be asked to the ENDORSER. \nHOLDER v BEARER:\nHOLDER: holder n. a general term for anyone in possession of property, but usually referring to anyone holding a promissory note, check, bond or other paper, either handed to the holder (delivery) or signed over by endorsement, for which he/she/it is entitled to receive payment as stated in the document. (See: check, bill of exchange, promissory note, bona fide purchaser, endorsement, holder in due course)\nBEARER:bearer n. anyone holding something, such as a check, promissory note, bank draft, or bond. This becomes important when the document (generally called a \"negotiable instrument\") states it is \"payable to bearer,\" which means whoever holds this paper it can receive the funds due on it. \nWhat am I missing - they seem synonymous.",
