   "message": "The BIRTH CERTIFICATE is an extract of the Statement of Birth.  The Statement of Birth represents where and when your parents signed you over to the state. \n\nIn Ontario there are 2 forms that make up a Statement of Birth.  Form 1 has all of your pertinent information on it and your parents information AND the Physician's signature.\n\nForm 1 is then taken and superimposed over form 2.  This is the legal sized form from Vital Statistics.  This is where Judy Hartman (the Deputy Registrar) puts her signature and the Seal of the Ontario Registrar General on it.   This is where the \"birth of the Surety\" occurs.\n\nIf you've ever tried to have your BIRTH CERTIFICATE authenticated, Service Canada WILL NOT do it.  However, THEY WILL authenticate a Statement of Birth.  The only reason why is because it has a raised seal on it.  Yet both documents have the same information in them.\n\nSo the Statement of Birth is the surety and the birth certificate is the check drawn against it to go out and administer in commerce.\nThat's my take on it anyway.",
