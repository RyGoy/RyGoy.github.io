   "message": "Ceit Butler , it looks like they may have. I spoke to the GRO head office. No record. I spoke to the local office in the City I was born in and they dont have a record either. They stated they only held a record of the original book which they take a certified copy to issue the birth certificate with the information from the hopsital. As I was born in 1979 the GRO did not keep records (only since 1990) and stated the notification of birth maybe held in the Hospital I was born.",
