   "message": "I'm pretty confident you could eventually succeed in crossing borders with the live birth record.\n\nThey ask for the birth certificate to issue a passport,\nBut the live birth registration is the foundation document, authored by a third party, testifying the facts, fwd'ing the birth of a man into the legal world via the act of birth and birth certificate...\n\nThat document's where everything legal starts.\nThat's where you are initially damaged as a human being.\nDamage = debt\nWhere there is debit, there's credit.\nYou are the creditor, whats being \"sold\"... You are victim of a fraud...\nAs such... It's my understanding you have the right to get a copy of that evidence...\nHow could they charge for this when THEY damaged you ?\nThat'd be extortion ??\n\nI'm I thinking way off or what ??",
