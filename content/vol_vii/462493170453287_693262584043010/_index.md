   "message": "Can Australian society, and indeed other world societies, expect to see the same as the following?\n\nHow many have entered a court-room identifying them-self to the court as  being a man/woman of body, mind and spirit, and not the called charged PERSON, then being told by the Magistrate that as the court cannot see or recognise a man or woman, therefore the man/woman was \"FREE\" to leave, yet the hearing continued against the PERSON charged, in absentia, and the PERSON found guilty?\nConsequently, if this is to be envisaged for the future, then it would very seriously compromise Govt's policy of encouraging'/'forcing' the unemployed into the work-force, as there only so many instances where dishes require washing. Furthermore, it could extend to tertiary-level education admissions, which, in turn, could affect generating course-fees and, consequently, tertiary institutions viability.\n\n",
