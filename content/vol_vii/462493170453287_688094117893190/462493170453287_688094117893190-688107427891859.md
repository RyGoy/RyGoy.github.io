   "message": "You look at the \"exhaust\" of the Free-dumb Guru \"Industry\". Karl Lentz doesn't give a shit if everyone gets it or not. He got paid. Even if he gives away 90% of his \"sales\" there is enough to sustain him, or he wouldn't be asking for money.\n\nThe fact that he \"succeeded\" on his own, in the PAST, does not mean the courts conduct themselves the same way NOW.\n\nFor me it ended when I saw my transcript edited to say \"I understood\". As far as AQUILAE is concerned, EVERYBODY who signed a document in that case (except the \"respondents\") has forfeited ALL rights!\n\n...and I will NEVER accept that they are a court of competent jurisdiction, EVER again.\n\n...Carl Lentz doesn't care. He will still think what he sells is true. Reality has no bearing. Those that PAY him, make an investment. That's why they do it.\n\nReality will show different.\n\nThe sad reality is that the time to pick up a gun and organize, is NOW, and most still think Jesus will fix it.",
