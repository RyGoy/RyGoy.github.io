   "message": "What I learned from Karl Lentz is the meaning of the words they use in court. Karl Lentz likes to say that what he teaches is \"so fucking simple it's scary\". Of all the research I have done (before TTFL of course) his information is the most practical and yes even simple to a degree. For example he talks about FLIPPING the court, moving to COMMON LAW jurisdiction and PROSECUTING the PROSECUTER. You must really know what you are doing and how to counter their trickery. There is not much room for error in my view. You must also be willing to play their game and dance with them in court. Why? I have zero interest in getting that close to anyone that means me harm.",
