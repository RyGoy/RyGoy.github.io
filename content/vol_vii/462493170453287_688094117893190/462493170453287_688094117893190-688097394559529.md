   "message": "This isn't an attack. His reasoning is sound. He just forgets that they are ignoring their own clubhouse rules.\n\nIn the 80's and 90's I tried my cases PRO SE because EVERYONE STUCK TO THE RULES (With notable exceptions). The courts had VALUE for your PERSON, as it did for MONEY.\n\nIt doesn't now. \n\nMistake and Fraud can't enter the record unresolved. PERIOD. NOTICE OF MISTAKE is designed to GET YOU OUT OF SURETY, not \"seek justice\".\n\nThe goal is to detach and damage. Not \"win\".\n\nHe's thinking he can win a rigged game. He's presuming the Administrators are impartial. They aren't.\n\nThat not an attack, that's a guy with sound reasoning... and a BELIEF that there are \"magic good courts\" that will rule honestly (there aren't).\n\nLIEN THEM PERSONALLY? That'd work\n\nHow does he plan to get their FULL NAME ADDRESS AND DATE OF BIRTH? You think they just hand that shit out?\n\nThere's a MISTAKE all right. He's making it. :P",
