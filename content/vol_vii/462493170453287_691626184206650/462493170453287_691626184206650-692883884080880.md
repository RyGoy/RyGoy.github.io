   "message": "I mean, let's think about this. Who is this Jeremy Richard?  He has been a member of this group for OVER A YEAR! And he has rarely appeared here.\n\nAll of the sudden, he appears from exile, asking Scott his thoughts about Santos Bonacci's \"win.\" He is friends with Adam Thomas, praises the buck-o-five welfare method, yet does not have all the \"pieces to the puzzle\" (Whatever that is), and says NOTHING about what happened, and how it happened. Then leaves again.\n\nSo I am not arbitrarily bashing Jeremy, I have reason to think he just showed-up to provoke Scott. Like that is going to work.",
