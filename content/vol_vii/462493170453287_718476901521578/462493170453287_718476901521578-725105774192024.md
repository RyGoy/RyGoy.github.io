   "message": "Dean's web associates have come to an amicable agreement regarding the website. There has been a great deal of stress and commotion, misunderstandings, and lack of communication until now. I'm sure you can all appreciate that with Dean's circumstances, not being in regular communication with the web-master, and no one really to take the lead, as everyone is working, things quickly turn into the \"telephone game.\" Moving forward, Dean was able to contact the web-master and get his message across, everyone was agreeable. Thank you to the web-master. We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused to the good people who are ready to progress with us and continue learning. Please refrain from ill comments towards our web-master, as he has graciously stepped down, and offered to provide the assistance that we need short-term. We thank him for all the hard work and sacrifice that he has dedicated at his own expense to help further the truth. Updates from Dean will commence asap We have a ridiculous amount of evidence of deliberate conspiring, fraud, dishonour, etc by Her Majesty's agents to report on.",
