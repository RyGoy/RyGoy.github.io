   "message": "Alright, assholes. :)\nI previously had posted a status to the page of a message that I had received from a tard named Allen Ott. I made an UH-OH! I clearly forgot to title that status, leaving room for ridicule. I was posting that status for everyone to get a good laugh, alas....my mistake lead me to the direct center of that.\nSo, laugh it up some more, have fun with it. Just thought I would make my point. If you must know, I have learned my lesson.\nAnd, Scott Duncan, I did not/do not have you blocked.",
