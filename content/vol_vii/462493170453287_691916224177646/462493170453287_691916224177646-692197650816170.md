   "message": "The Federal Reserve takes DEPOSITS to leverage VALUE against a medium for exchange which I ONLY have the beneficial use of, yes? The only way to get this money for exchange is to trade for it....putting that into money on account is dumb because that is for PERSONS. And the PERSON has an account at the Federal Reserve. So when Trustees ask Me to buy some of their debts or pay their interest for them, ME simply tells them which bank account  to find it in. Is this correct?",
