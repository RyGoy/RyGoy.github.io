I traded my labor and knowledge for these \"things\".  I have realized I OWN nothing.  \n\nI also realize, I can only USE these things; these THINGS do have USER FEES for my PERSON.  \n\nWhat is the best method to get the OWNER to pay for these USER FEES for my PERSON?\n\nFor this scenario, let us say I have a Private Trust.",
