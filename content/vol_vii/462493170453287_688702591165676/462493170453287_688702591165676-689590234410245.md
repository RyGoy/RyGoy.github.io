   "message": "You should actually TAKE ADVANTAGE of the fact that this is just a $30 ticket... Not as if a $30 claim was gonna stress you and ruin your life, even if that should take a couple months...\n\nLearn with that $30 ticket. And learning implies you must start with the BASIC FACTS and on the RIGHT tracks.\n\nThe ROOT FACT is that this ticket was ISSUED to a PERSON. You seem to UNDERSTAND that. Now let's make sure you can PROVE it to anyone who'd dare challenge you on this one. So WAIT until you get the BC. Then you'll be on your tracks !\n\nFor now, the only thing you CAN DO, if you wish to, is to ask QUESTIONS. (Or you buy back that debt and miss out on a great learning opportunity...)\n\nThe FIRST logical QUESTION should be (too bad this shit still isn't second nature enough to me as it is to Pete Daoust, because I'd have LOVED to ask that question FROM THE VERY BEGINNING to ANYONE sending a PUBLIC DEBT to WB...) :\n\nHey dear (WHOEVER the ticket is from) I got a ticket here that was issued to H JULIAN SPYER, and I wish you tell me if it's TRUE that I have the RIGHT to use the SURETY of the PERSON named H JULIAN SPYER to discharge this PUBLIC DEBT ?\n\nAnd wait...",
