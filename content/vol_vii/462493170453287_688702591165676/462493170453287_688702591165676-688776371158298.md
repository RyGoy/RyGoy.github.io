Matter of fact, you don't work for that PERSON and you NEVER ASKED to be a REPRESENTATIVE or AGENT or whatever word that means you are WORKING FOR THE PERSON... Because the PERSON is the GOVERNMENT. You never even asked for a PERSON, have you ??\n\nBest way to look at it is you ADMINISTRATE a 20$ bill, you don't ADMINISTRATE ON BEHALF OF the 20$ bill... get that ?",
