   "message": "Yes...but Eamonn, I am not sure about the Irish Banking System, but I am pretty sure that here in the States, the Social Security Number is only  for the Social Security jurisdiction.  Once you use that number outside that jurisdiction, lets say to open a Bank Account, I am fairly sure that it is only a Social Security Number in de facto status....it probably should be called a \"Treasury Number\" or a \"Banking Number\" or something like that.....",
