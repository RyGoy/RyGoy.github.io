   "message": "H Julian Spyer : Since I don't have the BC, what would be some other options to administrate?\n\nYou dont. You don't have the tools.\nYou don't even have a BILL to administrate this...\nIf they CHARGE YOU with something, they must send a BILL. And they won't send a BILL until they declare the DEFENDANT GUILTY of the CHARGE. So you ask the question and WAIT !\n\nBut in the meantime, you could start your STAMPS collection so - as a good administrator - when the time comes to ADMINISTRATE you are actually READY to ADMINISTRATE !",
