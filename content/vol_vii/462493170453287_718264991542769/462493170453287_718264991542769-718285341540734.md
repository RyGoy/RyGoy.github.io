   "message": "In the jurisdiction known as the 'COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA' it has been authorised by the 'Local Governments Act', a tertiary level of government.\n\nHowever, the constitution of the same jurisdiction does not recognise a tertiary level of government, and two referendums rejected the entire concept of a tertiary level of government...\n\nMy logical conclusion from this is it is something imposed/foisted upon 'persons' and only gets away with its actions by threats and intimidation...\n\nLocal council parking fines being an example\n\nCheck the constitution for that jurisdiction...it may be similar....\n\nOnce the property of the person has been liened into a different jurisdiction, write your own charter & by laws & do what you see fit ;-)",
