   "message": "Stuart Stone is correct for AUSTRALIA. Local Government was rejected twice by the people only for State Governments to impose them on the people anyway.  It appears that, in Victoria at least, all power that Local Government has comes from the State Government.  By that I mean the State Government creates the fines etc and Local Government just enforces them.\n\nFUN FACT: The relevant Act for Local Government here in Victoria says that Local Government is ACTING as a Representative Government and also Local Laws must not impose any tax or fee or any fine, imprisonment or other penalty",
