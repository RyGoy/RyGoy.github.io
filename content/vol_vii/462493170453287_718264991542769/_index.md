   "message": "Question: Where does a municipality get their authority and or jurisdiction to impose by-law(s) from?\n\nBackstory: I have to do some repairs to this house I am in, and according to the by-laws here I have to ask permission via a permit application, and then subject myself to inspections which I find to be a bit invasive. In this town the by-law inspector/building code guy is pretty nosey, and I know that he will be visiting me... :)\n\nI had read that it derives from the municipalities act (which I've read quickly and didn't find the answer), and I've reviewed my purchase agreement, but I can't seem to find where I've agreed to it so that I can fix it. Hopefully someone can point me in the right direction.\n\nThanks in advance for any and all comments guys :)",
