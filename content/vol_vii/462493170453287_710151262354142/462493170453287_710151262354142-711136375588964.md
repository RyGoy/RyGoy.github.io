   "message": "The flame war ends now, kids, take this to private messages if you must behave like 12-year olds.

Or the time of others, as you have chosen to do it in this open forum where the rest of us are forced to witness it?\"\n\nFinal warning; you are adults, in an adult forum where you are supposed to be learning how to think, and THIS is how you are choosing to spend your time. It ends now, one way or the other.",
