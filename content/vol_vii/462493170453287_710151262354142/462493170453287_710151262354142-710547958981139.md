   "message": "Aye aye Captain. What i am saying in a roundabout way is that after one places a comment; one should re read it to make sure that the comment can not be misinterpreted by another. Why? because the information/knowledge imparted on here by the contributors is very precise and is taken on board by beings like me very seriously. So in my opinion if somebody does a dump on here and ends up confusing another they should use the edit key to undo their shit and repost it in a plain and unambiguous way. If I cock up on here I redo it and /or edit it, to put it right so as not to confuse anyone. Thanks for the opportunity to reply captain.",
