   "message": "\" Because the ONLY Freeman Capitaine Pete wants here hold free corn roasts\" \n\nOkay, so he's missing a fucking comma. That sentence should read:\n\" Because the ONLY Freeman Capitaine Pete wants here, hold free corn roasts\".\n\nA comma. Carrying this ridiculous argument on for TWO DAYS, hurling insults and jumping down someone's throat over A FUCKING COMMA. \nUpon reflection, does this strike you as having been a VALUABLE expenditure of your time? Or the time of others, as you have chosen to do it in this open forum where the rest of us are forced to witness it?",
