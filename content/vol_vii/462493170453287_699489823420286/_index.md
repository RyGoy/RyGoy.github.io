   "message": "Was wondering,  with all the idiots running around in court, not a clue on what to do or say in front of a court. Would it be best to just start creating case law that can be referred to during all trials ... like meads v meads. At least a group of 20 people pair up and bring cases in civil court against one another. Work out the case prior, like the lawyers and even tender payment to opposition in front of judge. Write up a promissory note, tender it and the other party examines it and says well you forgot the Canada post stamp. Which Is supposed to be tribute to the Queen as per Promissory note act (for those apart of that club house) I think, it's so many cents per 100. 20 to 40 cases start poppin up with the tools everyone needs to bring these case laws into their own situations.  That is, for those who wish to play in that sand box. Yeah-?",
