   "message": "Kent , I proposed a built in mug holder for the back of Pete's shirts. I put my suggestion in before the limited time offer expired and as no other takers put in offers I should win the 5k doge coins by default! I would like you to forward the 5k doge coins to Pete's wallet for safe keeping , and Pete may administer said doge coins any way he wishes.",
