   "message": "I was caught in a speed trap....bogus!!! a cop sits at the bottom of a hill every morning and gets people one by one as they come down off the hill..I was going 10 miles over the posted sign for all of 3 seconds... and I didnt have my current insurance card with me so he wrote me up for that as well....after he threatened to arrest me for not giving him my ID...I asked him if I was committing a crime when he said he was citing me and he said \"yes\" i then asked if he was sure about that and he said if I didnt give him my drivers license he was taking me to jail....I returned the ticket within 3 days to the Courthouse with the following hand written on it, Refused for Cause, Without Prejudice, Without Recourse, Non Assumpsit....",
