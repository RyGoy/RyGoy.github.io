   "message": "I got the ticket amount called bail here in the mail....$1266.00 bullshit charges on a bogus ticket.  I then sent in a Protest for Non Acceptance and a Notary Default Judgment with a Claim letter......they sent me a failure to appear and put a hold on my drivers license.  I was not able to do the Notice of Mistake from this group because I had not studied it properly and I also provided my ID to the cop because of his threats to me",
