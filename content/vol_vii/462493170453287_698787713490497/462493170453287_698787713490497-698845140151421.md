   "message": "The Delphi Technique was developed by the Rand Corporation in the 1950s Cold War era to arrive at concensus on how many atomic bombs would be needed against Russia ... it was originally intended as a psychological weapon.\nHowever, it was soon recognized that the steps of Delphi could be very valuable in manipulating ANY meeting toward a predetermined end. In other words, to manipulate concensus.\nWe suggest also reading a paper written by Albert V. Burns, with an extensive knowledge of the conspiracy which has been working so hard to destroy this nation and incorporate it into a one world government.\nhttp://www.vlrc.org/articles/110.html\nHegel, on the other hand, a Maxist, developed a technique, the Helegelian Dialectic, to manipulate a group to choose what change they wanted from a choice, for example, but the group were not given the option of whether a change was actually wanted.\nAlmost all major events in history employ the Hegelian Dialectic of:\nProblem ï¿½ manufacture a crisis or take advantage of one already in place in order to get the desired Reaction of public outcry whereby the public demands a Solution which as been predetermined from the beginning. The Thesis-antiThesis dialectic.\n\nA classic example is 9/11 ... Red Flag.\nhttp://www.cf.ac.uk/socsi/undergraduate/introsoc/hegel.html\n\nConsequently, what we originally posted was a summary of those 2 theories and how, we the people, can recognise and how to defeat them.",
