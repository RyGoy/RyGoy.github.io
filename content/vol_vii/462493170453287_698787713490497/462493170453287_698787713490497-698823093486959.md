Not lookin' very... Tulsa-ey.\n7- www.anomalicresearch.com/ - Doesn't exist.\n8- www.nutrimedical.com - A doctor-run \"Buy my miraculous health products!\" site.\nAnd #9 is actually a site on Islamic terrorists.\n\nSo, that makes...1 out of 9? I don't know about you, but I wouldn't bet on those odds.",
