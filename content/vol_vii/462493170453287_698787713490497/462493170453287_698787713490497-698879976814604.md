   "message": "....um.\n\nKnownAs Colin. a couple of things:\n\n1: Ceit has a message, since you blocked her -\n\n\"The fact that you are either wilfully ignoring my point, or are simply too butt-hurt to see it only compounds the issue. If it were one of \"the boys\" having this conversation with you, I'm sure it would have gone VERY differently.\n\nWhether Scott is saying it or I'm saying it, the message is the same; CITE CREDIBLE SOURCES. The fact that you would say something as idiotic as this:\n\"KnownAs Colin: The subject focus is on the Delphi Technique and Hegelian Dialect methods used to manipulate groups and crowds, not the source of the document itself.\"\n\n...evidences that you haven't been paying attention to ANYTHING that Scott or Tara have EVER said. They each put tremendous effort into the things that they write, trying to get us all to think a little more, to see things clearly. Your blind ignorance belittles the time that they've invested in this group.\n\nI'm a hard person to offend, but, this offends me deeply.\"\n\n2: What the fuck is the matter with you, you coward. You block her because you cite bullshit sources and get called on it?\n\nThat's pathetic. Kill yourself.",
