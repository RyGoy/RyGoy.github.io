   "message": "what I do is simply have the company aquire and pay me in silver dollars. for you at your rate, thats ~4 an hour. you can do up to 12 and still stay below the minimum thresh hold for having to be required to FILE tax forms. figuring 4.2 weeks per month, 168 hours, and in Mass one can earn up to 600 per month without any reporting, thats 3 dollars an hour for ~ 500$ your below the thresh hold. ALTERNATIVELY you can set the company up a computer to mine, buy, trade, in digital currency, which ofcourse you technically have full control over, such as bitcoin and i can exchange bitcoin for things, like silver if you wanted.",
