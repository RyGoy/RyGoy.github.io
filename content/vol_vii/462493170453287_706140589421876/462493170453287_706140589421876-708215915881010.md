   "message": "Beverly, the new LLC package has just arrived, and I will be getting into that when I return home.\nIn your second post, are you saying that there should be a second LLC just as a holding company then? One for commerce, and that is held by the second (holding company). The trust is also held by that holding company, and all of the assets of my person are held in the trust.\nThis makes some sense to me. Is it correct though :/\n\nAlso, I think that I understand the concept of getting the trust to purchase the house and hold it in the trust, but where might I find more information on the logistics of actually getting that done? I'm thinking that I might be stuck on how to get that done.",
