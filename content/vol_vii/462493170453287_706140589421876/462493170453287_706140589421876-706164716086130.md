   "message": "Chris Evan, Eli Weakley, I totally get that point. Employee = slave indeed. \nI am currently working under an employment contract. It's an environment here where all the large corporations seem to hire everyone by contract. The problem however is that it is still an employer/employee relationship. \nI am working towards a new contract where I go in as a contractor and not an employee. Like a consultant, but with tools instead of a pen. \n\nHaving said that to give a bit of a description of where I am at, and where I want to go, my questions have to do with the actual drafting of the contract to avoid any pitfalls with respect to Canada Revenue Agency. Most of the people I expect to be dealing with on this are going to be Human Resource/Administrative clerks. The actual men and women I work around wouldn't give a shit about any of this. They are happy as slaves.",
