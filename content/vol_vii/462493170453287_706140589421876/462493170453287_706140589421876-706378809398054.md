   "message": "Yes Chris, I started as a regular electrician, and I've been kind of specializing over the last decade to include power lineman, and transmission stations. \nBefore TT4L I had a 2.5 year plan to be debt free in the traditional sense and start a small town electrical business to do just that. Now, I'm here and learning how to change up that plan, and how the traditional thinking is wrong.\n\nFrom where I'm sitting looking at the \"big picture\" it's quite overwhelming. So I am trying to break things down into smaller pieces and work on them one at a time. Just like any large construction project I've been on.",
