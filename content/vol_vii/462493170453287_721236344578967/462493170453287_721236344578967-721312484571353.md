   "message": "I made no such claims. You just presumed.\n\nYou only assume I have Anarchist Ideology. I just point to what is TRUE.\n\nI don't think ANY of you could survive in a voluntarist society, and I do not think any of you are bright enough to know what to do with it if you had it,.\n\nMOST of you are ADULTS with IMAGINARY FRIENDS, and will ALWAYS have a slave mentality.\n\nI did everything RIGHT. I didn't get what I paid for, and the cost of that  is:\n\nI collapse the banking system and kill 2/3rds of you.\n\nNotice \"freedom\" and \"anarchy\" have nothing to do with that?\n\nI am keeping a promise, and teaching you is simply a means to an end.\n\nPersonally, I think NONE of you DESERVE any freedom. I think you should all be in cages or hooked to the \"Wheel of Pain/Fitness\" generating power for my massive electricity needs.\n\nI don't actually care if ANY of you are \"free\". I don't give a shit. Care Factor=0.\n\nI am teaching all of YOU, in order to HARM OTHERS. Nothing else. When the streets flow with the blood of  Government workers, I will have succeeded in my goal.",
