   "message": "If you think, you live. If you \"believe\" you die.\n\nSlap any label you like on that. \n\nMessage to ALL: Breach any contract/treaty with ANYONE but me. If you do, you asked for it and sealed your neighbor's fate. Maybe next time you'll keep your promises.\n\nIf you find yourself in the unfortunate position of being a party who's breached a contract with me or the TRUSTS I serve, then all you need do is explain to everyone you care about, why the horrible things that are going to happen to them, are coming, and why you made that decision for them.",
