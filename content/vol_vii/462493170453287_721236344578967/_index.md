   "message": "Hey Scott, how does one having the understanding of Law and self-governance relate to your understanding and application of Anarchist ideologies, such as Larken Rose's; I see you share some of his comments and thoughts. \n\nHow does one \"navigate\" in something as hierarchical as legal jurisdictions and something as complex as Legalese, wanting to restore the Executive Power of the Monarchy while on the other hand not wanting to be governed by anyone. I am to \"ignorant\" and \"clueless\" to see the connection and to point it as contradiction therefore I don't me to be an ass about it. I'm only starting my studies with the group. Yet, asking question will be my access to knowledge and understaning. \nCheers!",
