   "message": "\"I am not sure about the LIEN Registration Period (Years)\" Pete Daoust \nI think the longer the better. When I first learned about commercial liens I recall a lien last 99 years but should that lien be held by a trust it lasts to infinitum and the lien falls to the heirs/successors. It's been some time since I watched the video so I may be mistaken. But 1 year seems to short. Even 5 years seems short.",
