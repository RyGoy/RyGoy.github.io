   "message": "I am posting with regards to internet services that have been stolen from me. \n\nThe past 2-3 weeks I have been unable to discuss the account via telephone, as I do not identify as a name and the agents are unable to answer any questions I have.  I identify myself as sole authorized administrator for the name.  They asked if I can/did/will ( or something like that) provide confirmation of same.  \n\nJuly 22, 2014, I completed the inchoate instrument sent to the person I happen to have in my pocket and attached a letter regarding the same to which I identified myself as SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for the name, via regular mail. \n\nOn July 28, services were suspended.  I called and told them the check was in the mail.  They said services would be re-instated as soon as they receive the check.  I informed them of possible legal action being taken against them for extortion of monies.  \n\nOn July 29, I received a phone call to which they asked to speak to whoever called yesterday.  I said I do not know who that would be.  The call ended. \n\nUpon return to my abode yesterday, I was delighted to see that services were reinstated, and thought the matter was settled. \n\nToday, July 30, 2014, I received a hand delivered URGENT NOTICE, a FINAL NOTICE dated for July 30. 2014. Services are to be DISCONNECTED Aug 1, 2014.\n\nThis is the letter I sent, stapled to the bill of exchange which I completed. \n\nJuly 22, 2014\n\nRE: Account #265-XXXXXXXXXXX\n        AMY COLLINS\n\nRogers, \n\nI have received the debt you sent to the person AMY COLLINS regarding Account # 265-XXXXXXXX with your company for your services, dated July 12, 2014.\n\nI am the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for AMY COLLINS.\n\nI wish for you to disclose ALL methods available to administrate this debt/bill of exchange regarding AMY COLLINS.\n\nI have asked for remittance advices from numerous agents in your company via telephone and no one can answer my questions.\n\nAm I able to use the SURETY of the PERSON to ADMINISTRATE this debt?\n\nIf you do not advise me on ALL methods available to discharge this debt, I will remit, to my best knowledge and ability, as per the Bill of Exchange Act (1985).  \n\nKindly advise if there are any defects in the instruments I have completed and enclosed.\n\nNo one is above the law.\n\nWith honesty and integrity,\n\nBy: \nSole Authorized Administrator for AMY COLLINS\nS.I.N. 1XX XXX XXX\nAll Rights Reserved/Without Prejudice\n\nAny comments?",
