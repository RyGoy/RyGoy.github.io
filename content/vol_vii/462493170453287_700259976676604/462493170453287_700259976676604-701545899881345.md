   "message": "I called Thursday to see if they received the check in the mail and why services were reinstated if they didn't. They claim they did not receive the check, services are still up for disconnection. The services were reinstated as per the payment arrangement with Walton, the first agent I spoke to about the suspended services, to whom I said the check was in the mail and this is an extortion of monies and I may take legal action and he said they will be restored when check is received. I assume they received the check The agent on Thursday said it takes approx. 10 days in mail....and that the 22nd to the 29th is 10 days. I said if you can lie about how many days are in a week, you can certainly lie about not receiving check. If they did not receive it then there is a problem with Canada Post. I said because I didn't send it registered mail, ye can lie. I do not consent to disconnection.",
