   "message": "Here's was my thoughts today.... :) ....\n\nNow, here�s the reasons WHY I want PIERRE DAOUST to be liened by 9111-1111 Quebec Inc, and to be kept IN TRUST, in the FTP TRUST.\n\n1). I do NOT trust the Government.\n\n2). I do NOT want to be SURETY for public debts, and/or public charges.\n\n3). I do NOT want to engage PIERRE DAOUST in commerce, without MY authorization.\n\n4). I do NOT want to be presumed a Government EMPLOYEE.\n\n5). I do NOT want to be presumed a Government AGENT.\n\n6). I do NOT want to be presumed a Government SLAVE.\n\n7). I want to have full control over PIERRE DAOUST.\n\n8). I want 9111-1111 Quebec Inc to deal with OFFERS sent to PIERRE DAOUST.\n\n9). I want 9111-1111 Quebec Inc, to be TRUSTEE, in regards to everything kept in FTP Trust.\n\n10). I�ve been trying to Administrate the person in good faith, I�ve been questioning the actual trustees (government), and they TOTALLY ignore me, so I can�t see any other options, to be free.\n\nI, as the sole authorized administrator for PIERRE DAOUST, will deal ESCLUSIVELY with PIERRE DAOUST�s new TRUSTEE, because it's obvious this is the ONLY trustee I can �TRUST�.\n\nI resign�.. \n\nNow, all bills will be paid by 9111-1111 Quebec Inc.\n9111-1111 Quebec Inc will bill PIERRE DAOUST for these bills paid, PLUS FEES�.\n\nBills of Exchange will be sent to 9111-1111 Quebec Inc.\n9111-1111 Quebec Inc will deposit these bills of exchange in its bank account.\n\nCan�t wait on HOW the bank will deal with these� :D\n\nAnd the BEST agent (Director) for 9111-1111 Quebec Inc, will certainly be Gilles Daoust :D",
