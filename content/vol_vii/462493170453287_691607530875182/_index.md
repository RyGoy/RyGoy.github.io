   "message": "The person I happen to administrate received a signed a letter from a TRUSTEE, the Comptroller of the State, acknowledging the fact her Office had received notice that I was acting as the Administrator for the Person. :O \n\nThe letter (not the envelope) is address to the Sole Authorized Administrator for the Name, and here is just some parts of what is says: \n\n<<July 2, 2014\n\nSole Authorized Administrator for Mackximus Minimus\nAddress XXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nDear Administrator:\n\nWe received your communication. In brief, you notify this Office that you are the Sole Authorized Administrator for The NAME...\n\nWe understand that the information and documents you sent us should be sent to the P.R. Treasury Department...>>\n\nThey also sent everything I sent them back to ME, the notice, the copy of the BC, the affirmation, and the envelope. Hahaha! But I have a SIGNED LETTER from a TRUSTEE. :D\n\nThe good thing is that I have already NOTICED the PR Treasury Department.
