   "message": "But to whomever has not grasped some of the things that are happening here:\n\nIf this \"Sole Authorized Administrator\" was some looney shit, or if it did not exist, why would the Comptroller ACKNOWLEDGE the Title/Capacity of Sole Authorized Administrator, and Administrator?   You know how many lawyers probably helped her draft the answer? \n\nAnother thing, as I had correctly suspected, the Administrator's \"name\" (if any), it is irrelevant. Names are for PERSONS. I did not send ANY NAME for the Man/Administrator, on anything. Not even in the affirmation. I am just the Sole Authorized Administrator for the NAME. Why was not she freaking out, because the Administrator did not labeled himself with a \"name\"?\n\nShe also points me to the right direction, the Treasury. Why would she do that, and put it in writing, if this was some \"crazy\" letter? \n\n:/",
