   "message": "Maybe one last shot before I freeze PIERRE DAOUST ?\n\nThoughts ??...this shit comes right from my brain, and it's not legal advice, and not a recommendation of some sort....\n\nI just use logic, and spew it out of my brain :D , so BE CAREFUL.\n\nOk, there�s a lot of UNANSWERED questions, from the Sole Authorized Administrator, addressed to the TRUSTESS.\n\n1). Can I use PIERRE DAOUST�s surety to discharge public debts?\n2). What birth date should I put on this health care card renewal form?\n3). Where are all these Bill of Exchange I have sent to Hydro-Quebec?\n\nSo, this cause a situation where PIERRE DAOUST has no health care card, no driver�s license and, me, as the sole authorized administrator for PIERRE DAOUST, I am having a hard time to use PIERRE DAOUST to do commerce with :D , AND IT�S NOT MY FAULT�.\n\nSo, I am planning on sending a PROPER NOTICE to all these PUBLIC TRUSTEES who refuses to answer my SIMPLE questions.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nDear PUBLIC TRUSTEES,\n\nSince you are NOT doing your job, by not answering my SIMPLE questions, I have no other choices but to BELIEVE that you don�t want me to use this person, I happen to have, to do commerce with, so you are putting ME, the sole authorized administrator for PIERRE DAOUST, in a situation where I just CAN�T administrate correctly, and in good faith, the person named PIERRE DAOUST 119XXXXXXXXXX.\n\nBe advise that from this day, I will send you ALL the administration duties concerning PIERRE DAOUST, because I just CAN�T take care of these duties, without these ANSWERS.\n\nAnd since YOU are the party with SURETY in regards to the person named PIERRE DAOUST 119XXXXXXXXXX, I am sure you will know what to do with it.\n\nWith all my love.\n\nSole Authorized Administrator for PIERRE DAOUST 119XXXXXXXXXX",
