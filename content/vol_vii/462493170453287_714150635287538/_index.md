Everyone is welcome at THE TENDER FOR LAW.\n\nScott Duncan added Lindsey Davis to the group.\n14 mins\nLindsey Davis\nLindsey Davis's photo.\nLindsey Davis\nLikeLike �\n\n    Scott Duncan ...Joined Facebook 5 DAYS ago.\n\n    ...and joins THE TENDER FOR LAW. (A SECRET group)...See More\n    12 mins � Edited � Unlike � 2\n    Tara Duncan I don't know. Seems perfectly fine to me. Hot blonde with what looks like an alcoholic drink. Locked down Facebook page. Yep, nothing to see here.\n    9 mins � Like\n    Scott Duncan So... Trap, then?\n    7 mins � Unlike � 1\n    Tara Duncan Trap!\n    7 mins � Like � 2\n    Tara Duncan Let's not get too carried away just yet. Everybody knows alcoholic party girls can keep a secret, no?\n    7 mins � Like � 1\n    Scott Duncan They really need to work on figuring out my taste in women... Watch more of the works of Paul F. Little, for my \"type\", guys! This one doesn't do it for me.\n    4 mins � Like\n    Scott Duncan ...plus the fact that she joined facebook 5 days ago, and \"stumbled into\" the SECRET group, THE TENDER FOR LAW... as \"party girls\" do.\n    2 mins � Like\n    David-Paul Sip Hmmmm...the picture is fine in appearance but the substance seems to be lacking. Must be a blonde thing. Could also be a case of your reputation preceding you. Maybe this Lindsay joined Facebook just for you Admiral Possible and yet me thinks definitely a trap.\n    2 mins � Like � 1\n    Tara Duncan Do they EVER! Perhaps Lindsey will drop by and regale us with the fascinating story of how she came to join the group. I'll wait.\n    1 min � Like � 1\n    Lindsey Davis Why'd you invite me to this retarded group?",
