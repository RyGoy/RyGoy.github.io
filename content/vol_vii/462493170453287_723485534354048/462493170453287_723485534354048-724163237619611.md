   "message": "I think my mistake is setting up ESC CTRL inc (Trustee) as a sole proprietary, holding company. I mistakenly thought I could hire an administrator as required to Administrate the Trust and/or the affairs of the person to which it would hold power of attorney. I mistakenly thought  I could be the Director for ESC CTRL inc, hire a Trustee and accountant as required. My understanding is that Far Arden Trust is just a piece of paper and no one's business. Being the beneficiary of Far Arden Trust, I am not authorized to answer any questions. Should any questions arise ESC CTRL would take the helm as power of attorney and/or Trustee and or administrator. Other than that \"it's just a fucking piece of paper\" What the fuck am I missing?",
