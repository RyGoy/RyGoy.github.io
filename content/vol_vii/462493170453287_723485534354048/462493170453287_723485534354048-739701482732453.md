   "message": "Good thread Will Bed. I had a car loan with Anglo Irish Bank (Defunct Irish Bank now called IBRC - Due to be wound up in March 2015) which I applied for and received in 2005 and repaid in full in 2010 with interest. I will start the same process that Will has excellently demonstrated in this thread. The amount of the loan is ï¿½5,000. I have a question of Admiral Scott Duncan on how the same process could be implemented on a commercial loan with the company I work had and fully repaid. Could the same process with the same bank be initiated on behalf of the company by an AUTHORISED ADMINISTRATOR? The loan was transferred from IBRC (IRISH BANKING RESOLUTION CORPORATION) to NAMA, (National Asset Management Agency) and fully repaid. If the promissory note can be successfully retrieved the impact on Irish and European Banking system may be substantial and also for the potential of the issuance of a large amount of Lapdancecoins :P",
