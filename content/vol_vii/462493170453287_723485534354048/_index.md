   "message": "Some of you guys may remember, back in april, I requested that the bank return the 20 000$ promissory note which was created when the PERSON contracted a car loan, a contract which was fully honored in may 2009.\n\nIt's taken a full 6 months, 5 or 6 registered letter communications, reminding 2 of their uncooperative agents what the law says, but it seems the last communication, sent directly to the Director of the bank's branch, made them comply :D\n\nI just got a short, 6 lines letter, sent to the PERSON by the General Director, explaining who to contac in order to go get that promissory note back.\n\nIs there anything I should be aware of and/or make sure they do or dont do when I go there to pick it up, except of course not ID ing as the PERSON ?\n\nOr would it be a better option to have them sending it back to the PERSON, registered mail ?",
