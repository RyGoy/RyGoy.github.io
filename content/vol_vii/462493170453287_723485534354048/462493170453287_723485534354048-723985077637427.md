   "message": "Greg, \n\nI actually sent them 6 or 7 communications over a 6 months period... This case, I started it all by requesting a simple account statement PROVING a loan contract ever existed, created XX/XX/2007 which was fully honored by the PERSON on XX/XX/2009.\n\nThey provided that account statement.\n\nI then asked if they still had the original PROMISSORY NOTE which I signed as CREDITOR, which they received, and was used as a SECURITY for the amount created.\n\nThey accepted to provide a CONFORM COPY of said document.\n\nAt this point, I had PROOF that - at some point in time - they did have that document in their possession. I played stupid and told them I might need the ORIGINAL document they just photocopied and stamped, so dont lose it...\n\nThen they said they COULD NOT provide to me the ORIGINAL document from which they made the CONFORM COPY they sent to the PERSON. A lady called, bullshitted me random crap like they never received a PROMISSORY NOTE, then that they did NOT have to return THEIR original, then they had to send it to a special place, crap like that... I insisted again...\n\nI told reminded them that the document was not THEIRS, that they HAD to RETURN it, and since it seemed they may be interested in making it THEIR ASSET, I conditionally offered to sell it to them and I included an invoice for full amount, which they had to settle...\n\nAt this point, they sent what seemed like a notary deliver a communication threatening to CHARGE the PERSON for all their expenses related to this case...\n\nAll that kinda was the easy part.\nAs I was telling Scott, I ALWAYS make sure I remind them of all the FACTS, rebut all their bullshit CLAIMS with FACTS, and remind them of every LEGAL obligation they have to honor and WHY I'm doing what I'm doing...\n\nI found that asking questions they are required to answer, tight questions, like\nBlablabla ? This (A) or This (B) answer ?\nBecause if (A), then blablabla, and\nBecause if (B), then blablabla, and\nIn both cases, you must blablabla... \n\nAlways cover all angles... These suckers will try to hide under every rock you may leave unturned...\n\nNow, I'm not here to give you the answers, but all the tools you need are in :\nBank act\nBills of exchange act\nFinancial administration act\nCriminal code of Canada\n\nThey also cited the \"Loi sur la protection du consommateur\" which we have here in Quebec, but even by that law, they were fucked by article 101...\n\nAs long as you understand that they illegally kept a NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT which is NOT THEIRS and which is worth WHATEVER AMOUNT IT WAS SIGNED FOR, you should be able to word your letter properly. \n\nWrite it up and post it here...\nOh, and Keep It Simple Stupid ! Dont be afraid to sound like an ignorant guy asking questions. Remember whoever gonna read that first letter is most certainly more ignorant than you are ! You dont wanna scare them too bad right off the bat ;)",
