   "message": "I did not... It was a 6hrs+ call... We discussed quite a few different topics... VERY INTERESTING call !!\n\nIn regards to this topic, Scott explained that they should be instructed to send the note back registered mail, and that ME walking in there would be accepting their jurisdiction...\n\nWe discussed that if they INDEED return the original note, that would mean they most certainly had to absorb a loss for the 32 fold fractionally reserved amount that'd now be backed by the note... And they'd be pissed, and they'll most certainly be on the lookout for that note to hit back the financial markets or see whatever happens with it...\n\nLet's see how things go from here !\nI'll obviously keep you guys updated on this :)",
