   "message": "For the first time while dealing with threatening letters from lawyers representing a toll road company, or any company for that matter, I'm actually quite annoyed... Before I may have been excited to try this or that and see what the outcome was, but now I'm pretty pissed off with their shit.\n\nMaking threats of legal action with no fucking evidence of surety in the matter... I've asked 3 times to provide evidence of surety and they've failed and now they threaten legal action?! I'm fuckin insulted!\n\nIf they can't show ME any evidence then what grounds are they gonna have to bring any legal action?! \n\nMuppets...",
