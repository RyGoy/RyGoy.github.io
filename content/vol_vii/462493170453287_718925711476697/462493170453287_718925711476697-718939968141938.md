   "message": "The fucking Judge said oh thats your name, I said its not about my name its about who is SURETY for name. I said you didnt answer my question and disrespecting me. I said i wasn't a ward of the court, like the other sheeples there. Thats when they escorted me out. So Monday I get to do it infront of a jury. The State attorney whispered to her partner drop the case. So most likely Monday will end it. I said I administer the name. It was pretty fun to see how much of a threat I am to save me for last. Then I overheard the judge say oh why wasn't he warned. He thought I was gonna say something to incriminate me....boy the look on their eyes was priceless.",
