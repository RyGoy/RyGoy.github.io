   "message": "My thoughts exactly and this example seems to confirm this beeeeautifully. I could go into the validity of the contract created by the driver's licence (namely disclosure) but that doesn't seem necessary if \"The Legal Name on the Birth Certificate with the sole signature of the government makes it the SURETY always.\" I had a reason for asking you my original question brother. It also makes me think about  Chris Evan and his experience up in Slave-chussettes. A different jurisdiction I know and a very different outcome. I just want to be certain my thinking isn't flawed here :)",
