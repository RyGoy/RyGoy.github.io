   "message": "No this time I didnt get a chance to mail it cause they wouldn't tell me who the judge was going be and I got my Birth Certificate late from NY so I only had that one chance before trial to get it filed. So I read it out loud and on the record in court. So funny was the judge advising me that state was present and that everything I say will be used against me... hahahahaha I said yes make sure your recording everything I have to say. Then the moment of silence in the court room. Judge was like who the fuck is this guy and I wasn't he warned. Hahahaha",
