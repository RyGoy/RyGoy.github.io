   "message": "<<coercion, threat and duress>> What the fuck is that? :/ Threats with words? Why would any sane man will talk to strangers with guns, that are violently looking to get information from you, to HURT you? Even if there is a gun to  my head, what is the point of talking or signing anything, if it will be used to HURT ME? Shame/fear of not responding/obeying? FUCK THAT! \n\nThese people are attempting to commit crimes against ME, demanding any information. Fuck their codefied slavery! Who says I have to do/say anything? By what authority?",
