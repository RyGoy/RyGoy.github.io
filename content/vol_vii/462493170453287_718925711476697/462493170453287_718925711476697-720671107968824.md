   "message": "Oh now that's some fucking interesting shit. Bare with me for a moment Michael because this is important. So following this line of thinking, that \"driver's licence\" with your signature and photo, became evidence that proved (no longer DEEMED or PRESUMED) that you were the PERSON named on that government ID. And yet you were abe to use the NOTICE OF MISTAKE to remove SURETY even though state agents used the Driver's Licence (previously refered to as the cheese in another post when compared to the Birth Cirtificate) to IDentify you. Fascinating! :D Do you see where I'm going with this Capitain Pete?",
