   "message": "That is another thing, IF driving, make sure your tags, insurance, and inspection are in order. An expired tag, broken tail lights, tinted windows, all that shit is like a sign saying \"STOP ME, PLEASE!\"\n\nAlso, if driving and you are not planning to comply with the codes or having a driver license, drive by YOURSELF, alone. Do not drive with passengers, family, or folks that will most likely act as witness against you, when confronted with questions from \"authorities.\" You may also put them in danger, if you are planning to go bananas on the cops. If you are with family or friends, have SOMEONE ELSE drive for you, problem solved.",
