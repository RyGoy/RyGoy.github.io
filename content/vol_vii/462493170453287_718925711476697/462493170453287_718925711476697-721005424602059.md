   "message": "Seeing as I was threatened with arrest by this \"supervisor\" no less than 3X and STOOD MY GROUND brother I know who I am and they knew it too. This was the point where I said \"I mean you no harm\" To which the lying bitch replied \"We mean you no harm either\". She even asked \"Why am I not being compliant?\" To which I answered \"Am I required to be?\" Ultimately I chose my battle and decided that a more controlled environment where my boy's safety was not at risk was wiser. This is always the RIGHT choice.",
