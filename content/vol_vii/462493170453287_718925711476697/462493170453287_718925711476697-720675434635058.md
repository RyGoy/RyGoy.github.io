   "message": "Oh I'm really fucking thinking now. I've read that the driver's licence is evidence of a contract, that not only did folks ask for this licence, they agreed that they were the PERSON named when they signed, and when they provided their signature they become SURETY. That this licence is evidence that YOU are the PERSON and is proof and no longer PRESUMPTION. Of course in Michael's example the \"driver's licence\" was used to IDentify him in a criminal matter, not a traffic matter. Does this really matter though? Am I thinking wrong or is this a shit stain?",
