   "message": "I was able to defuse the situation by telling both of them outside the car \"I mean you no harm\" with my recording device in hand. She noticed this and her entire demeanor changed. I also told her \"I do not recognize you\" to which she replied \"Of course you don't\". She knew exactly what i was saying :o I then handed them the documents telling then they were being provided under protest, threat and duress. Amazingly I drove away that day with an \"expired tag\" and one of their  NOTICEs.",
