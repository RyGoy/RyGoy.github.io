   "message": "It's possible but highly unlikely. Sounds like you got yourself a shitty old phone. You know, batteries don't last forever and neither does the hardware. They literally build them to break down. It's called planned obsolescence which helps the corrupted corporations create  cyclic consumption. That's a lot of C words but basically, it insures that customers continue buying their shitty phones every year or two. I'm guessing you're phone is a piece of shit and you got pulled over by assholes. Again, I'm just taking a stab in the dark here. If you've had your phone for around one year, you can almost bet on it breaking down soon. The next time your phone doesn't hold a charge, have a back up on hand.",
