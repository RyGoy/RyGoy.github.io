   "message": "My cell phone had full battery.  After the movie, the cell phone was dead.  20 minutes later, I was pulled over with emergency lights.  No recording device available besides cell phone, which didn't work.   I  was harassed, threatened, and assaulted by two policy enforcers and THEY told my guest he could go inside.  Virgin mobile says it is not possible for the cell phone to be affected from outside of their service without a warrant and such. My cell phone is fucked and I have nothing but serious  troubles the last few months.   Improbable my ass!",
