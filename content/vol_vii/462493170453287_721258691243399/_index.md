   "message": "(As I see it) With the signing of the FIPA, seeing how it is meant to \"ultimately\" coerce \"citizenry of CANADA\", as ignorant taxpayers, to eventually act (as public opinion) against the Treaty contracts with First Nations due to the inevitable and insurmountable tax funds extorted through \"secret\" courts and settlements, I have a question for Scott Duncan...\n\nEntity A has a contract with entity B first, then entity B makes another contract with entity C. If the B&C contract caused the contract of A&B to be devalued in someway, wouldn't entity A have recourse against entity B?",
