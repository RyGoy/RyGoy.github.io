The bank is headquartered at Commerce Court in Toronto, Ontario.[1] CIBC's Institution Number (or bank number) is 010, and its SWIFT code is CIBCCATT.\n\nThe bank's two strategic business units, CIBC World Markets and CIBC Retail Markets, also have international operations in the United States, the Caribbean, Asia and the United Kingdom. Globally, CIBC serves more than eleven million clients, and has over 40,000 employees. The company ranks at number 172 on the Forbes Global 2000 listing.[2] CIBC was named the strongest bank in Canada and North America, and the 3rd strongest bank in the world, by Bloomberg Markets magazine, in May 2012.[3]\n\nA chartered bank is an institution whose primary business is financial intermediation, meaning the bringing together of borrowers and lenders.\n\nQuestion:  Can this be done with any chartered bank or is CIBC used for a specific reason?",
