   "message": "Maximus Legis, Costa Rica does NOT have an army.  It has the smallest police force in the whole Americas. Minimal, but decent infrastructure, Internet, and is friendly to foreigners that settle there. There is a good number of Americans, and others living there. Fresh food, low cost of living, and access to land.\n\nVenezuela is not a place you want to be in the next few years, as a foreigner.",
