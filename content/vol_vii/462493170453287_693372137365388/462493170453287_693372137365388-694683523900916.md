   "message": "This guy is just doing it the \" 'Murican way\". How many times is there an advertisement about searching through the internet and finding information, putting it all together and writing some book of your own interpretation of it. Sell that shit for $4 for a pdf copy cause someone out there will buy that... c'mon. \n\nAnd, he purchased that information for a $4 book, like you couldn't figure that out yourself... \n\nAnd to succeed in those shitty book sales, he blogs and does the whole bogus internet \"I have value and Google says so\" bit...\n\nHe plays on what people want ï¿½to be free. For fiat.\n\nBottom line on this whole issue, HE FUCKING KNOWS where the Notice of Mistake came from... he was here, for a while. Where the fuck else did it come from? Some alien?\n\nGeeze.",
