   "message": "Trent Goodbaudy\n\nScott Duncan, I would love to hear your feedback! I am finally following\n\nYOUR advice and sending a notice of mistake. Yes folks... I am doing\n\nwhat Scott said (or at least my interpretation of it).\n\nI am using this for a child support allegation, but you could use this for\n\nanything!\n\nScott Duncan To quote a recent post...\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE is AWESOME!\n\nBoy, the guy who came up with that, must be AWESOME!\n\n�hmmm. That really does sound better when other people say it. \n\nJuly 1 at 1:22pm � Like � 4\n\nTrent Goodbaudy \"You\" is awesome! \n\nJuly 1 at 1:23pm � Like � 2\n\nScott Duncan That is actually very well done. It covers everything.\n\nJuly 1 at 1:23pm � Like\n\nTrent Goodbaudy Thank you, I try to absorb everything I can from\n\nthe \"black belts\"\n\nJuly 1 at 1:24pm � Like � 3\n\nTrent Goodbaudy The quality of the product is based on the\n\nquality of the instructor. I know that your ego doesn't need any more\n\ninflating, but sincerely... thanks for being there Scott, and all that you\n\ndo.\n\nJuly 1 at 1:45pm � Like � 2\n\nScott Duncan I'm just warming up, Trent! \n\nIt's going to take a bit of social-engineering, and a LOT of teaching, but I\n\nam building something HUGE. \n\nWhen thetenderforlaw.com is up, then I will start showing you how to\n\nsecure your freedom with technology. Not only that, I will show you all,\n\nstep-by-step, how to do EXACTLY the same thing. All the government\n\nstooges can do is tremble in impotent fury, while we construct beyond\n\ntheir understanding.\n\nI'm waiting for a declaration of \"crazy\" from the government, so I am\n\nfree to disclose EVERYTHING... including the very contract that bound\n\nme to keep my mouth shut. \n\nSo, I'm glad you appreciate it, and am overjoyed that you are actually\n\nUSING it in its proper manner. \n\nIt's not an ego-boost, it's reassurance that I'm not wasting my most\n\nprecious asset; My time.\n\nJuly 1 at 1:46pm � Unlike � 15\n\nTrent Goodbaudy You are DEFINITELY not wasting your time! That\n\nis something I CAN swear to!\n\nJuly 1 at 1:48pm � Like � 4\n\nJeffrey Dale Sarnstrom Keep up the great work Scott!\n\nJuly 1 at 1:50pm � Like � 1\n\nScott Duncan That never works.\n\nI'll Be doing it \"Kahn Academy\" style. 10 minute video clips.\n\nJuly 1 at 2:14pm � Like � 4\n\nTrent Goodbaudy I like that I got it all on one page.",
