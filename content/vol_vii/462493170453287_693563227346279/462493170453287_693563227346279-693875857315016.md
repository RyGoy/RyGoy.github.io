Good news is i don't make a habit of going to court, but i don't have any warrants out. Also, to those who think that i pussed out during my interaction with the cops today, i am not trying to be a gladiator and fight every one, i am a peaceful inhabitant and don't want to fight.. i didn't get arrested which is a success in my book.\"\n\nI wouldn't buy a slurpee from that guy...",
