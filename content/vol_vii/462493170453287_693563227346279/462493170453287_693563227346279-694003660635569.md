   "message": "It appears he was staying at someone's property who was out of town and he stated he had a key.  Although having a key to the property, it appears the owner wished for him to leave. \n\nHe interacted with the cop EXACTLY how he says NOT to.  Then the cop gave him 8 hours to remove his stuff from the property and to leave the key.  There is more posted on his page about this, but it's down for now.",
