   "message": "every letter to the lawyer was started with \"WHO ARE YOU?\"...funny when I went to the JP, i had to educate them as well. When I brought this up to them, they said \"he says here who he is..and its on letter head\"...I said it doesnt provide proof of anything Im looking for....he says he is  doesnt prove anything...and the letter head simply proves he works at this law firm...that still does not prove anything to me",
