   "message": "The ONLY reason to LIEN THE NAME is to SECURE it.\n\nThe BIRTH CERTIFICATE is now YOURS. The TRUSTed party liening it, has endorsed this. It is now a FACT IN LAW (No legal authority exists, outside of yourself, to challenge it) that you own your name. Look at the relationship between you and your BANK when you have a MORTGAGE. It's the same thing.\n\nThat's also means the TRUST has first rights of refusal, and that is LIMITED TO THE TERMS SET OUT IN IT.\n\nThat's why NOBODY will give you credit. Until COMMERCE trusts your TRUST (Or the corporation holding it) you had better have value to sustain it.",
