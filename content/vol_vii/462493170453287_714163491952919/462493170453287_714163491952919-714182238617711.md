   "message": "In his submission for the notice of application, he has spouted alot  including naming all as  \"sovereign man\"...about the (fraudulent) default judgement.....all that is just distraction and causing confusion? In my defence would I just acknowledge it and ask for relevance and or proof of his claims..and focus on what you've shared this evening as a defence..then do a counter claim against him for his fraud?",
