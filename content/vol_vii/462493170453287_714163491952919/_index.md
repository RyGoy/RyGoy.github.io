   "message": "Ladies and Gentlemen:\n\nWhat follows is probably going to be the most informative thread ever posted on THE TENDER FOR LAW.  I have come up with the ultimate format.\n\nYou see, dear members, a disgruntled AGENT with a prefabricated Facebook page that would make the most seasoned spammers blush, keeps messaging me privately talking about all the \"harm\" I'm doing; and keeps citing lies and half truths and a bunch of presumptions. He then brought Gail Marie into it. I'm not sure if anyone remembers Dan Wilson [ https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006985755010 ] \n\nFor thirty years I've dealt with different flavours of this ilk, but this is the first time I have ever been able to do THIS.  \n\nI'm going to respond to absolutely everything he says in private messages, in a useful, succinct and productive way so all of you can follow along...\n\nThis type of AGENT wields a double-edged sword of half-truths.  The dialogue is long and is ongoing, and to neutralize any accusations of \"editing\" I shall be posting screen captures of each bit of the conversation that I'm replying to.  This will teach all of you how to respond to \"ass-hats\" who use the same methods, and most of all it will show when a government agenda is in play.\n\nLet's start with his very first message to me:",
