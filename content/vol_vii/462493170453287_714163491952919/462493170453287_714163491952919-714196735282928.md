   "message": "This is, of course, the slogan of TODD, THE SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION LEMUR, who is of course, a much beloved Public Service Announcement (PSA) character, found on safety literature distributed throughout the AQUILAE Navy. Todd is endorsed by ALL the captains, INCLUDING THE WOMEN (Who are the only captains who really matter! There! I said it!) so  you know he's good enough for your daughter.\n\n...we also have a \"Pedo-bear\" version (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedobear) for those who refuse to take Todd seriously, even though they want gay threesomes with Smokey the Bear and Elmer the Safety Elephant. :P  ...and christian closet-cases. Ok that was gratuitous. Sorry. :(\n\nStill though... TODD!",
