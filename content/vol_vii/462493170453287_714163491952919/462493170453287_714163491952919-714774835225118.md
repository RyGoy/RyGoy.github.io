   "message": "In the previous claim made against GAIL, the documents sent to the court by the corp were returned to without cause and a default judgement awarded to him as if I didn't respond.  Anyone have any tips to ensure that the notice is accepted into the court file and not returned as if I didn't respond and then a default awarded against GAIL et al?",
