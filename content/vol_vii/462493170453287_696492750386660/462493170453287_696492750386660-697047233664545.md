   "message": "Not registered, but I've sent instruments, demands and inquiries via Xpresspost, regular mail, fax or a combination. Either they ignore them or send them back saying I didn't send an instrument that can be used for payment or that they don't understand the request. Maybe if you know negotiable instrument law and can enforce it something might come of it, but \"asking nicely\" didn't work for me.",
