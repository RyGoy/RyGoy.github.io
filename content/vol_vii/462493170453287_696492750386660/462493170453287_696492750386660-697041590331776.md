   "message": "With CRA I sent in several instruments and asked about settling a tax account \"without the use of public funds\" with multiple collection agents, the Minister of National Revenue, filed a Service Complaint, appealed to the Ombudsman, and was met with ignorance every time. \"A review of your file indicates CRA staff have clearly articulated what constitutes a negotiable payment over the years, both verbally and in writing.  In addition, the methods of payment are public knowledge and can be found on CRA's web site.\"",
