   "message": "Representative Cheri Bustos (IL 17th CD)\n1009 Longworth House Office Building \nWashington, DC 20515\n\n Dear Congresswoman Bustos, \nThank you for taking the time to read this correspondence and good day. I have in the course of seeking truth and answers to the many issues we as a nation face today come across some very shocking information and as such I REQUIRE that you my elected representative kindly answer some questions. I have been informed that law as we know it applies to PERSONS and there are many types of PERSONS in law. It has been revealed to me that I as a man have a PERSON, it is not mine, and I am not SURETY for it. I believe I have been misled along with the rest of the general public into thinking this PERSON was me! It seems to me I am a man, I have this PERSON and it�s not my fault. So can you please tell me is this true?\n\n It has also been revealed to me that I can use the SURETY of the PERSON I happen to have to DISCHARGE public debts sent to that PERSON. Is this true? If so how does one accomplish this? I can�t help but think of all the struggling families that would be helped by this information immediately. I�m sure you are eager to help them as well.\n\n I eagerly await your timely response regarding this matter.\n\n With love and regards,",
