   "message": "So, he contracts to work for the employer for a year, at the rate of 12$/month, and then the employer gives him 10.75$/month? The 15$ given upfront looks to be worked off in the first month and a bit, then he leaves (probably because he is being shorted by 1.25$/month) , then they charge him....\n(I'd leave too by-the-way)\nThen it appears that they deemed that he had the intent to break the contract from the beginning. How did they figure it was without just cause though?",
