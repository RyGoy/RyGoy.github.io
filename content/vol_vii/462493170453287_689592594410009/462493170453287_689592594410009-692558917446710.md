   "message": "Just another random thought here. I have in the past had my wife deposit a check into my account, all she needed was my account number.\nLooking on my utility bill, I see what appears to be a similar account number. If I had a valuable security and I wanted to deposit it into a specific account for which I had the account number, couldn't I just go to a branch of that bank and do it at the teller?\nIn Pete's case, they are not depositing (or giving it back), what if this took the choice away from them on depositing it?",
