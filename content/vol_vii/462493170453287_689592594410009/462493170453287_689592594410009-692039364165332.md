A number has the following form:\n\nXXXXX-YYY\nwhere XXXXX is a Branch Number, and YYY is an Institution Number. The dash between the branch number and the institution number is an integral part of the transit number. This format is only valid for paper-type transactions such as cheques.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_transit_number#Third_and_fourth_digits",
