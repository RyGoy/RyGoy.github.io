   "message": "just like when you pay off a loan you do not get the promissory note back even though its yours the same will hold true for a Bill of exchange . They are negotiable instruments............... the bank sells them and keeps the money ...But any money they get for it is yours you never bother to request the note be returned so thew bank gets paid twice once by the selling of the note and then by you paying off the loan",
