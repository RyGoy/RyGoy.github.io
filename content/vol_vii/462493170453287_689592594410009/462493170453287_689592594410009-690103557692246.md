I am honest, because I must be.\n\nNow look for all those who hate me.\n\nNOBODY likes truth. EVERYONE likes liars, because they, themselves lie ALL the time, so they feel better about themselves when YOU do it WITH them.\n\nNONE OF YOU like honesty. You just don't!\n\nWhy would you expect them to suddenly BE HONEST?",
