   "message": "Is there any truth to �96 is your fix�?\nNo. �96 is your fix� is an internet myth. A bill payment remittance, which appears at the bottom of an invoice, is a way for you to send a payment to that biller. It is not a payment to you.\nThe bottom portion of an invoice, or bill, referred to in the CPA Rules as a bill payment remittance, cannot be �redeemed� or �accepted for value� by the person who is required to pay an amount owing. Signing a bill payment remittance or writing any personal information on it is not a valid way to pay or somehow �cancel� the amount that you owe the biller. Not paying for goods or services can have serious legal consequences, which fall outside the CPA�s jurisdiction.\nTo pay a company to which you owe money at your financial institution, you give the financial institution the bill payment remittance along with a payment from your own funds. The information on the bill payment remittance permits your financial institution to send your payment to the company�s financial institution electronically, and the payment that you have made is then deposited into the account of the company that you are paying.",
