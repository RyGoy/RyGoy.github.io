   "message": "I avail of  free electricity, Replace 63amp fuse before the meter, as this is removed when one is \"cut off \" in ireland. Then your supply is officially disconnected and the electric company leave you alone. This works a treat in ireland as most main fuses and meters are in the house itself. So fuck off anyone who wants to check the meter !!",
