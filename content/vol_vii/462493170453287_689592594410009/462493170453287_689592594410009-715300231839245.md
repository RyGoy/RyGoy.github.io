   "message": "And folks need a refridgerator if they are going to keep the food from spoiling (nobody drys and salts their food much these days). A calculator isn't needed if you learned math and know how to calculate long hand but is handy. When the defecation hits the oscillation you better believe a radio will be needed (preferably crank in case there is no electric) :P \n\nI'm not seeing what a TV is \"needed\" for but the fucktards are mesmerized by it...It's like a God to them. And yet it's 11 o'clock, and they don't know where their children are (As Channel 7 News Buffalo started it broadcast of with in the 70's and 80's)... Lol!",
