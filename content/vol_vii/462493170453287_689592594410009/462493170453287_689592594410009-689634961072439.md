   "message": "That was the first question I've asked Hydro-Quebec, THEY NEVER PROVIDED a fucking answer, now that bill is at $7k, they just think they can interrupt the fucking service ?\n\nThey think they don't have any RESPONSIBILITY over this ?\n\nI told them MANY time to tell me I was wrong, THEY NEVER DID....\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with this ?\n\nI have ALL the good reasons to believe that they have stripped me from what belongs to me.\n\nAnd I am not amused :P\n\nThe ONLY thing I am asking for, is a piece of paper from Hydro, and/or Bank of Canada, saying: NO, you can't use the person's surety for that debt sent to the person....\n\nThat's all :P",
