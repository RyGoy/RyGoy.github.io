   "message": "I'm serious. :(\n\nTwo ships are joining the fleet this year.\n\nDan's vessel is in dry-dock, so he spent the time building a squad of fucking MARINES. I can request that people with guns invade... anywhere, AND THEY'LL DO IT!\n\nThis is a fact here in reality. This is a thing, now...\n\nThat is just ONE of the many things that have happened.\n\nWTF will I have in 5 years?\n\nONE mistake will destroy or set-back, a LIFETIME'S work. This is my life now. I REALLY AM frightened at the power I have now. I'm not using hyperbole here.\n\nTara is a Captain, so there is a conflict of interest, discussing it, so all I can do is log/publish my concerns. :/",
