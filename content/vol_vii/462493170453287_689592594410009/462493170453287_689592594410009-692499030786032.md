   "message": "\"They transfered the file in their COMPLAINT department, without me having made a complaint, and withou my authorization, and they now, want me to seek remedy\" \n\nThis is an interesting development Capitaine Pete. Kind of like playing hot potato! Looks familiar. When I sent the CRA an invoice for my tax collection services last year (after they assessed interest and penalties for late filing) they transferred the matter to Commisioner of Appeals without me even asking for an appeal. I declined this offer to APPEAL = gain jurisdiction since I had made it clear in previous correspondance that unless they intended to compensate me for my services they were to zero out and close the HST account. \n\nWhat do you think about sending HQ NOTICE that unless they return your property within 24 hours that they will be billed $1 per minute (or whatever you feel the continued ADMINISTRATION is worth) plus the VALUE of those BoE until  they are all returned to you?",
