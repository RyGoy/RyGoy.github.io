I am trying to decode the different numbers and such .....  and the 5 digit is apparently identifies the branch and 3 digit code identifies the \"institution\".  So we need the remittance to go into that account ..  .... not be drawn from it..... so that's why you are filling out your information to complete bill of exchange..... somehow it makes sense to me to send it to the person's bank...... and they can complete the Bill of Exchange. .... So how do we find the public trustee.....",
