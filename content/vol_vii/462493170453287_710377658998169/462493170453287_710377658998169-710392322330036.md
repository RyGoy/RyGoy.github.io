YOU ignore TREATY OBLIGATIONS, DOMESTIC OBLIGATIONS and most of your INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS. YOUR perpetual breach of the PUBLIC TRUST is intolerable.\n\nI no longer accept and/or consent to the burden of YOUR SOCIETY; it's customs and impositions. \n\nI decline to be re/presented as an ORGANIZATION, WARD, TAXPAYER, PERSON, SURETY and/or ACCOUNTANT and in fact tender my resignation as such.",
