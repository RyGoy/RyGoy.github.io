   "message": "From the Surety article:\n\nScott Duncan Make LOTS of NOTARIZED copies of your BIRTH CERTIFICATE. The court has the name there.\nMarch 23, 2013 at 11:43am � Like � 1\n\nScott Duncan ...they already have the \"person\". Kelleran Holman has it right. If I'm asked I tell them JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN is ALREADY in the court's custody.\n\nYou only need make NOTARIZED COPIES because you are identifying the security of the name. The BIRTH CERTIFICATE is NOT THE NAME, it's PROOF of the SECURITY OF THE PERSON. The number of copeis is irrelevant.\nMarch 23, 2013 at 12:32pm � Like � 2\n\nThen I thought you said they need an original to create a bond...\n\nScott, why did you say this?",
