And they have given them instructions that only the Vital Statistic Office can make certified copies of the birth certificate, and that they will \"loose their license\" if the make copies of a birth certificate. \n\nBUT, REAL surety bonds here are just $5 dollars per bond  from Vital Statistics, haha! So I do not have this problem. I can request up to 10 at the time. :D And it's not my fault!",
