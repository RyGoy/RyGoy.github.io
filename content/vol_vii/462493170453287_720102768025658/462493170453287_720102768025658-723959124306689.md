   "message": "Regarding a response to this I am thinking Do Not Call.  Maintain communication via Registered Mail.\n\nThe way I see it, there is no reason for Council to invoke the Privacy Act.  They have no reason to.  I have not asked for any details, whether personal and/or financial etc from anyone.  I have asked, what I consider, a general question.  Can the surety of the Person be used to discharge this public debt? It's a simple yes or no.\n\nI'm not interested in a discussion. I want an answer to a question.  So I am of the opinion that sending a response stating the above is the way to go..\n\nI think there is perhaps more in this response than what I am seeing.",
