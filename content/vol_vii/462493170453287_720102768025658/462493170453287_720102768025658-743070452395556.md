   "message": "Another response but this time to my third letter to Hume City Council regarding Rates.. Didn't hear anything back from the second but she does acknowledge receipt of it as can be seen.\n\nI'm curious that she doesn't know (Or claims not to know) about surety/security of the person.\n\nHere in Australia, we have no Bill and/or Charter of Human Rights (Those countries that do mention security of the person). I'm thinking perhaps this fact alone may have a lot of these people clueless as the rest of the masses and if so, why she may not know. If her response is genuine of course\n\nI'm a little bit stumped on how to reply to this.  Pete or anyone else have any tips??",
