   "message": "i always love it when they use the privacy bullshit .............. we all know by now it doesn`t exist and means nothing When you owe them money because they give it to a third person (collections). Its always best to let them know right up front before you sign any thing that you to have a privacy policy and the release of any of your personal information to any third party including law enforcement and gov`t  subjects them to a fee of 5000.00 for each offense",
