   "message": "I would be surprised if the Admiral predicted any timeframe to prepare for the worst (I read a comment where he said he could not predict). The truth is the plug could be pulled at any time without warning. I personally think it could be another 5-7 years (we're talking world war). Let me know if you want to join me in Las Vegas Michael Atkins for a firearms training course this fall.  If possible I would also recommend Krav Maga training. Martial arts training will not serve you very well in hand-to-hand urban conflict.",
