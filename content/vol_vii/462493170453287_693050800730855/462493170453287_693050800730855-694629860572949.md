   "message": "I hate to say this, being that I'm have no use for religion myself, but if you actually read any of those so-called holy books, you might find that Jesus didn't want to be worshipped...he just wanted you to \"think outside the box\". Clearly, those who profit from his so-called religion are the ones who wanted nothing to do with him, and had him killed. but i digress....it concerns me none. i hope that points you in the right direction. Scott is right, clearly it says so in the front cover of the book who's pulling your chains.",
