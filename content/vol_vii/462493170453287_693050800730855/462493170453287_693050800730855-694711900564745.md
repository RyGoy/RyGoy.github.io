   "message": "thats a good choice Pete, problem is, how do you help someone you do not know? I have given up on the old folks on this planet (including my own family), the youth of this world are the ones who deserve this information, specifically, those who don't trust the system. specifically those willing to do what it takes to improve the lot of us all. I see Rena growing in strength every day, she was very excited to learn and read but this event will only serve to disillusion her about the intent of the members here. she has come a long way in her short life and shit like this only brings back the abuse she has suffered her entire 23yrs in this hell hole. who want to revisit that shit. If joining 3 groups with the intent to learn as direct is a red flag then most of us would not be here.",
