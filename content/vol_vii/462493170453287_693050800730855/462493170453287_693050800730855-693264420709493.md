   "message": "A few tools to get out of the 'matrix':\n\n1.  Realise who you are (a man/woman), who HAS a person.\n      (NOTICE OF MISTAKE REMOVES THIS PRESUMPTION AND   \n      DEFLECTS SURETY)...change the capacity that you are acting in:  \n      SOLE AUTHORISED ADMINISTRATOR is one way to do this.\n\n      STOP USING THAT NAME WHEN ACTING AS YOU (MAN)...it is a \n      GIVEN name for YOU to use in commerce.  To avoid the  \n      confusion/surety, use a TAKEN name for yourself.\n\n2.  Realise that for all practical purposes (SURETY), you are deemed to  \n     be THAT person...somewhere in there, you are consequently \n     deemed to be a government employee...so you need to RESIGN \n     from this post.\n\n3.  Set up a corporation to act as a CURRENCY EXCHANGE/BANK:\n     It receives $, converts it into the internal currency of the corporation, \n     removing the liability(ies) attached to legal tender...ie:  If you don't use \n     their toys or play their game, then their rules don't apply to YOU.\n\n4.  As YOU are the only party that has added value (TIME and ENERGY)  \n     to the NAME, and you haven't been adequately compensated for it, \n     YOU may wish to have the value claimed/liened into a private trust, \n     held by the corporation in 3. above.\n\n     This SECURES the NAME into a different jurisdiction, one which is \n     controlled by a private trust, in a private corporation, with only ONE \n     shareholder....YOU.\n\n     The NAME has now been subjected to a civil death and no longer   \n     exists in their jurisdiction.  It will remain in your created jurisdiction \n     until the value of the lien has been discharged, a couple of days after \n     the 12th of never.\n\nFeel free to add details or tidy up any stainshits gang :-)",
