   "message": "This group is about an agenda. Is not about us, even if we get benefit.  Look at all the time it has taken to train just very few of us: 19 months. And every day we ALL learn something new in this group. So, is it very true that this group is NOT for a quick \"get out of jail free\" card, or how to discharge parking tickets.\n\nA lifetime of programing is not an \"easy fix.\" YEARS, and years of programing of believing that the \"quick, fast result\" needs to be attained. Like attending to a seminar, or two, will fix a lifetime of bullshit, and lies.\n\nThe information is NOTHING, if we do not know how to think. That is one of the most valuable things I have gained here. Scott has helped many of us to be able to use our brain in an useful manner, by thinking. He is NOT a spoon feeder. We have to fill in the gaps, and sometimes very wide gaps. \n\nI am glad to see new members reading, and making the right questions. I wish you find the value of the knowledge shared by Scott on this group.",
