The Bank of Canada is not a central bank and a commercial financial institution. Therefore, it does not take or accept deposits, bonds, securities or other funds on behalf of the public.

It pursues this objective by keeping inflation low, stable and predictable level. In addition, it issues banknotes quality that are readily accepted and counterfeit-proof, and ensures the reliability and efficiency of the Canadian financial system.\nSincerely,",
