   "message": "David-Paul Sip \"The GOVERNMENT has left that to the LAW SOCIETY to CLAIM so the GOVERNMENT can CLAIM its \"hands are clean\". The GOVERNMENT only has AUTHORITY over the NAME/PERSON. The GOVERNMENT has NEVER claimed AUTHORITY over MAN. The GOVERNMENT KNOWS about the DECEPTION but ALLOWS it to persist because they NEVER claimed authority over MAN (plausible deniability) so it's not their problem. The government has left the \"dirty work\" to the LAW SOCIETY.\"\n\nIf a man disputes this jurisdiction though, how can they prove that it applies?\n\nI wonder how a man would pre-emptively dispute that claim?",
