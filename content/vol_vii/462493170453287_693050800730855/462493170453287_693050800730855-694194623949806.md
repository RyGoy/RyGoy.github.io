   "message": "I agree with you Pete Daoust, I have had similar concerns:\n\nCompleting a bill of exchange on a mortgage for example:\n\nThey referred me to the section of the contract that says payments MUST be made by direct debit, unless otherwise agreed.\n\nThey accepted an over-payment by cheque 3 years ago, showing that they had agreed otherwise, so why not now?\n\nThey do not wish to return the completed bill of exchange either...\n\nMy out loud musings were along the lines of what Chris Evan was saying:\n\nEven though there are letters of instruction with the bill of exchange, the directions (in my case) did not form part of the bill of exchange.\n\nEven though I wrote asking for all means of administering account, to which I received no reply, the account statements (and the contract) clearly states what form of payment they WILL accept, so cash in an envelope (completed bill of exchange in this case), in their eyes MUST be a gift, just as a tip given to a waitress MUST be a tip.\n\nMy focus for now, is determining if there is anything I have/haven't done that is in MY control, to have these debts discharged.",
