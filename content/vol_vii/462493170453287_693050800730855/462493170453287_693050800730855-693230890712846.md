   "message": "These comments are only my thoughts Michael . They make sense to me but could also be one big shit stain. Feel free to share as I'm sure the Admiral will let me know if this is the case. I did read somewhere before that the CROWN was liable if they were unsuccessful in getting a MAN to admit to being the NAME. The LAW SOCIETY claiming jurisdiction over MAN seems to tie everything in this triad together. Not what I was expecting from this much anticipated article Admiral Scott. BEAUuuuuuTIFULLY done!",
