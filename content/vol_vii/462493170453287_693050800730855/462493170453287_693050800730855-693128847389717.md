   "message": "\"Using the LAW dictionary of your choice, you will find that \"INDIVIDUAL\" is distinctly a \"PRIVATE orNATURAL PERSON\" (One OR the other! NO LIABILITY or FULL LIABILITY), and the LAW SOCIETY CLAIMS JURISDICTION.\"  \n\nWhat the fuck! When ATTORN is considered with HABEUS CORPUS this makes complete sense. The LAW SOCIETY CLAIMS JURISDICTION over MAN! The only role of the ATTORNEY GENERAL is to hand a MAN (the body), which they have claimed jurisdiction over, to the GOVERNMENT so that the government has its SURETY for the NAME/PERSON that they created in their JURISDICTION. Yeah! They both make money so this must be a win-win. :/",
