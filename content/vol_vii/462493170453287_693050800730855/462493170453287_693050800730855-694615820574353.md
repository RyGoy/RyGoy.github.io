   "message": "Nothing \"personnal\" at all ;) just I remember not so long ago Scott seemed to imply you could be an agent, NSA he said if I'm not mistaken... Not that I wouldnt find that funny ;) And reading your posts DID seem like you came here somewhat \"prepared\" / or reallllllllly into investment / trading for someone to join a group opposing the banking cartel... I kinda got the same feeling reading Absalom Kobayashi Maru I had reading you... Except his posts seem more vague/evasive... Maybe that's just me.",
