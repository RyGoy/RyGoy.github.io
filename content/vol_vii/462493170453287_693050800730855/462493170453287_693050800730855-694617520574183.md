   "message": "I originally joined the group in June of 2013. I left and filed my CORPS and UCC 1 & 3 etc..  I worked for a few months, and I returned to learn more.

I know that I get honest and critical feedback in here. I don't care if it makes me look like a moron.  I can take honest criticism.",
