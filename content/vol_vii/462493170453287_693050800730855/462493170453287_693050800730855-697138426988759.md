   "message": "Enjoyed reading your comments Absalom Kobayashi Maru and agree with you and Chris that to know where one is going one must understand where they have come from. That said  we have been lied to and to attempt to decipher the truth when none of us were there may not be the best use of our time. Point: Aim to understand but do not allow it to become an all consuming exercise. Remember that there is nothing any of us can do to change the past/history. Ironically this triggered thoughts of a Scottism...what was it Mackximus Minimus? \"If it's hard then you're doing it wrong\" or something along this line.",
