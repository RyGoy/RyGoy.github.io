   "message": "My goal, is to NOT buy back public debts, and have the person's surety discharge these PUBLIC debts.....because, apparently, I have the RIGHT to the person's surety, and the reason WHY I don't want to buy back these debts is that I have good reasons to believe that PUBLIC TRUSTEES are STEALING from me....\n\nEVERYONE knows this, I am telling them as it is....\n\nNow, the BIG question is, Am I a slave and have no choice to buy them back ?\n\nOr, Am I free, and can decide for my self... :D",
