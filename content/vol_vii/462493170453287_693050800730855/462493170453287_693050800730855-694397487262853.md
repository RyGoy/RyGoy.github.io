   "message": "Pete....another idea.  :-D  For the future of course...I think you are doing the ONLY thing you can now.  \n\nLets say you complete an inchoate instrument and make it a VALUABLE SECURITY by identifying the 3 parties, writing out the dollar amount, dating...etc....whatever one does (buck o five, etc...whatever).  Then you affix the registered mail sticker to the BoE, then you send it REGISTERED MAIL to the PERSON.  It is now a REGISTERED SECURITY.  Then someone you trust, or YOU, HOLDS these Instruments and CLAIMS them.  Then they can be LEVERAGED for MONEY for EXCHANGE for future PUBLIC DEBTS.",
