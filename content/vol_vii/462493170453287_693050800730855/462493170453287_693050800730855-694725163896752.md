   "message": "'I have a cunt but I am not a cunt'...well said:\n\nThe guy equivalent:  'I have a prick but I'm not a prick'.\n\nThat's the concept 'I have a person but I'm not the person' in a nutshell...in the first few hours of being here.\n\nSeriously though, I don't know anyone's story to any great extent here, unless actively shared...that isn't my reason for being here.\n\nIt takes guts to get up again after life has handed out too many shit sandwiches...kudos for that.\n\nCome back & learn, do a bunch of reading & once some of the concepts are solidified, start asking questions.\n\nIt appears that no matter what has happened in the past, we are developing the tools and skills to call to account those who have caused harm...that can't be a bad thing.",
