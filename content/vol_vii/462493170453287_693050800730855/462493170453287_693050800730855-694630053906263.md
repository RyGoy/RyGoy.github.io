   "message": "People accuse ME of running a \"cult\"... that encourages critical thought... Hmmm.\n\n...oh and as the \"leader\" of the cult, it turns out I LIKE TO FUCK! I REALLY REALLY DO! A LOT! You have NO idea...\n\n...except I'm not really big on pretense. I don't need a \"god\" to brainwash women, and the sexual harassment complaints that cross my desk, are just complaints that I don't do it enough :D\n\nYou can call this a \"cult\" if you want, but I really suck at the whole \"cult Leader\" thing.",
