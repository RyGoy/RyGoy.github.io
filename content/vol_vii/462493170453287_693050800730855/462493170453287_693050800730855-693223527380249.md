   "message": "As far as I can tell Adrian this changes nothing. This is still a question of SURETY. When I refute the PRESUMPTION that I am SURETY for the PERSON/NAME with the NOTICE OF MISTAKE this creates a dilemna for the LAW SOCIETY since if the LAW SOCIETY claims JURISDICTION over MAN then they must also be ACTING as SURETY for MAN. This might be a shit stain but this makes sense to me from what I have learned from the Admiral thus far.\n\nWhat seems obvious to me is that the LAW SOCIETY does not want to be SURETY, they ONLY want to get PAID. So they will ensure that they OFFER up a MAN in their place who will ACT as SURETY in order to deflect it from themselves.  If the Man they attempt to turn over to the GOVERNMENT is not the SURETY (See NOTICE of MISTAKE) but rather, as Capitaine Pete said, the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for the NAME/PERSON their illusion crumbles.",
