   "message": "If you were lied to then is that not a TORT? Wherever you're going... if you do not know where you came from then no matter where you go you wouldn't be able tell if you actually went anywhere, and you may not have gone anywhere and only thought you had. \n\nI wrote this earlier in reply to someone else about indian treaties... \"The treaties were with the US but if the US is bankrupt and insolvent then the US is not even there to treat with. The 'asset' of the US is held in receivership (New Deal) to maintain services. But the Natives have no treaty with the international creditors, so if there are no such treaties in place do they have to honor what's not there? You cannot default on a contract which does not exist. The only way for a treaty to be honored is if the parties maintain and hold on to their solvency.\"\n\n1 U.S. Code � 1 - Words denoting number, gender, and so forth: the words �insane� and �insane person� shall include every idiot, insane person, and person non compos mentis;\n\nThat's like page 1 of their own code. So if you're here using their titles and law forum, benefits and privileges how is that operating with clean hands? How is it not particeps criminis? And here's an 'ism' for ya, Who in their RIGHT MIND would remain subject to or in collusion with an insane system of abuse and torture?; Who would NOT be competent to administer their own affairs? Maybe the only way to move forward is to cut the chains that bind you to the illusion? Maybe the only way to tell if anyone else is sane and competent is if this is what they are doing? Because if you don't then i can't tell if you really do not believe in the illusion anymore or not. You could be just saying that and lack conviction and participate in the illusion selectively.",
