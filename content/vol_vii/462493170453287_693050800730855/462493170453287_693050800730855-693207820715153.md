   "message": "One way to pre-emptively dispute the CLAIM of JURISDICTION is the NOTICE of MISTAKE. Do not allow them to PRESUME or DEEM you to be anything. FUCK them! Then there are these questions and I quote the following from the article: \n\n\"what evidence does this court have that I have any SURETY in this matter?\", and \"by what authority does this court attach ANY name derived from a PUBLIC DOCUMENT to me?\".  These two questions effectively remove any LEGAL PRESUMPTION as regards the NAME.",
