Just because they say something does not make it so. \"All men are equal before the law\" (a Maxim of Law if my memory serves me). Did the LAW SOCIETY create MAN? Did they LAW SOCIETY create me? Where they in bed with my parents when I was conceived? If they did not create ME than how can they OWN me (the CREATOR = the OWNER of that THING)? It is their CLAIM to prove and they can NEVER prove such a thing. All they can offer is \"because I said so\" so FUCK THEM!",
