   "message": "I Came across this GREAT video this morning -\n\nBatman has a discussion with a REAL fucking ass clown.. a FAR bigger clown than the joker\n\nI know I shouldn't be surprised but I'm actually amazed. Pretty much EVERYTHING Menard says is fucked up in some way. This chimp is ACTUALLY a guru??\n\nBetween Menard and Clifford, no wonder the FREEDUMB movement is in such shambles...\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the one with a brain in video is Batman. He knows to ask questions and request proof of claim. Very wise advice.\n\nI dedicate this one to Scott - enjoy the laugh, Me and Bev sure fuckin' did!\n\n",
