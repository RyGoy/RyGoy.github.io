   "message": "ok once again from the dept of learning as I go along....this was included in the liars package for the hearing related to his application to have the lien removed. I'm trying to figure out exactly what is going on with this.  It appears based on the court clerks comment that they have filed a notice of bankruptcy for GAIL AND LARRY.  If this is the case, they have done so without the consent of GAIL AND LARRY.  Of course this is yet another charge to the liar for unauthorized use of the name.. is anyone aware of a \"law\" that makes this action by the liar and the court clerk legal?",
