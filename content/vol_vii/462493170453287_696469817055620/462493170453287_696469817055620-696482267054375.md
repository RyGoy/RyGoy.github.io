   "message": "There apparently is a large oil field in the Gaza area, which Israel and the euro want to control.\nSame goes with Crimea.\n\nRussia currently is the world's #1 oil producer, and a strong power.\n\nThe US ousted Saddam and Gaddafi because both countries were oil and gold rich, a threat to the Saudis, US and Israel - Rothschild controlled - allies, business and most importantly both wanted to expose/oust the worthless USD as world reserve currency for oil which would bring the collapse... They want to clear Syria and Iran out of the picture for similar reasons...\n\nThe Ukrainian govt has ordered snipers to shoot their own people to blame Russia a few weeks ago, and now theres info that the MH17 plane could have been downed by Ukrainian fighter jets...\n\nThere are rumours out there that Russia cleared their debt to the Rothschilds and kicked them out.\nIT'S ALL ABOUT GOLD, OIL AND DRUGS, and controlling the natural resources of the countries which arent yet enslaved under the fiat / Rothschild banking cartel, through invasion, destruction, aid and DEBT...\n\nWith BRICS in the picture, there may be a very real threat to the euro/north american worthless debt enslavement system... WWIII could easily be sparked over this.\n\nWith the media propaganda / bullshit lies disinformation, a free internet is the only mean to share the information, and they wanna control that too...\n\nIt's people's tax dollars / man and women time and energy / at work ! Enslavement to further secure enslavement. This shit matters, whether it happens here or anywhere.\n\nI TOTALLY AGREE that we've got our own problems to care about, but when the bastard in charge of trying to enslave me through a person which isnt me clearly is a Rothschild / Zionist puppet is supporting fuckin war crimes, this shit must be exposed. \nHe doesnt represent ME. \nLet this be PUBLIC NOTICE !\n\nTime to think about sanctions for breach of public trust ???",
