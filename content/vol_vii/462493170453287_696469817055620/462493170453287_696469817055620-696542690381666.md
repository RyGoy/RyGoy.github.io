   "message": "That is why they have trespass laws in government buildings. You demand answers when you go to see them, they call security and cops to arrest you. You contact through the mail and they ignore. They don't care. They have no obligation in their minds to help you with anything other than PAY. I know how frustrating dealing with these fools (public servants) is. \nThe video where Scott goes to get transcripts should answer all questions to this.\nThe shit for brains who told Pete on the phone that he was there to help him pay and that's all.\nAnd then let us not forget about the circus act with Chris Evan!\nI have looked back at my post over the last few weeks and I see anger surfacing due to frustration.\nI have to take a short break from this.",
