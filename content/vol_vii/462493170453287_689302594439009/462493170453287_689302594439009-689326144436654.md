   "message": "1. I'm not an infiltrator.  2. I am pretty pissed about learning a lot of the things I have.  3. I spent a lot of time and money going to school for a profession now based on complete bullshit (marketing, international management).  So, knowing what I do now, about having a person has made me sloppy and more aggressive.  I joined the group closer to Feb. 2013.  I was using my first name Charles then.  I am now using my taken or middle name Jason.  I will not defend my comments, they were reckless and abusive.  Regardless, I did not mean anyone harm.  I apologize for any risk I have put on others.  Other than that, my time is better spent learning. Thanks",
