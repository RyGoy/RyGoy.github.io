   "message": "...perhaps it's a matter of scale. Perhaps your stultified mind is so sluggish, and restrained that it APPEARS to be \"rambling\" and your mind works too slow to parse it.\n\nI try my best to dumb it down to your level. I really do. The fact that you think it's \"rambling\" is a failing in YOU. I cannot dumb it down further. It hurts to communicate with your ilk at the level I do, and I simply can't go any further down. You're going to have to meet me a SMALL part of the way.",
