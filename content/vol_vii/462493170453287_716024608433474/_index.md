   "message": "This documentary is going to cause some anger and might get stuck in your craw. It is full of examples of what not to do as parents or accused. It also shows the \"railroad\" procedures of not just cops and judges but some of the accomplices who go along - pretending nescient - for a paycheck.\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2925642/\n\nIf I had children, I'd want to know how to be able to protect \"them\" from being Stolen, Abused, and/or Killed by the state's mob. I realize this is a large subject but am compelled to ask... Can I administrate a child's person? Can that person be in the same trust I have my person?, Would I need to create a separate trust for that person? Do I qualify as an administrator or am I about to be cannon fodder.   :/",
