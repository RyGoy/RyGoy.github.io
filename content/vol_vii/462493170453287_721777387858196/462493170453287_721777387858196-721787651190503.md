   "message": "The purpose behind this guy's campaign is to attach it TO ME.\n\nThey lie about what I've said, attach their made-up bullshit to Gail Marie, and say \"It's Scott Duncan's fault\". \n\nDan Wilson \nJohn Trew\nLindsey Davis \n\nALL THE SAME PERSON. Just so you know.\n\nThis is a LAWYER campaign. Notice when he uses \"free-dumber\" and it's pointed out that he's using a term I MADE UP, he just ignores it... Like they do in Court. It's all they know. They don't know anything else. That's how they are trained to deal with these ugly realities. Ignore, lie, distract. That's all they know. \n\nThinking, feeling men and women cannot and DO NOT think this way. ONLY LAWYERS DO.",
