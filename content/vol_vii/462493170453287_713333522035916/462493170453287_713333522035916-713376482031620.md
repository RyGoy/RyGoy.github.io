   "message": "Does the government have anything relevant to say? Pete asks a lot of questions and if you get pissed off over this little bit of pestering, you are in for a very rude awakening when you begin this battle with the Government. I think he is trying to test your resolve and your already getting all bent out of shape. If your looking for the magic words or a \"specific formula\" then you are in the wrong place as those don't exist . You had better know who you are and what you stand for and what you are willing to lose and also what it is you really value before you decide to don your \"mankini\" and enter the battlefield your wandering towards. It sounds like your just looking for some free stuff but in reality your going to find yourself stuffed in a hurry if you don't pay attention to what you should be looking for and researching to better your abilities to defend your rights. Pete is the farthest thing from lazy and your comments lack merit or substance. When you have put in the time and have been thru what Pete has done and endured, then and only then will you understand that your \"lazy\" comment fits what you want out of this more than what you think of Pete for not giving you the answer. Go look it up for yourself or are you too lazy and prefer to be served? Do we look like slaves here?",
