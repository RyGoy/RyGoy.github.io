   "message": "I owe you a thank you Ceit. I had a court date and was frantically looking for the notice of mistake.I came across it in one of your posts and printed it off and highlighted what I needed to say without putting my foot in my mouth (or worst). The case I had been fighting for 4 long and stressful years was dismissed and a previous order has been recinded and dismissed so that is all done! thanks to everyone for their help and advice,and especially to Scott for all the countless hours (no doubt most of them frustrating for him) that he has spent on the phone talking to me and helping me to understand .( My ass is healing nicely too in case any of you were wondering!",
