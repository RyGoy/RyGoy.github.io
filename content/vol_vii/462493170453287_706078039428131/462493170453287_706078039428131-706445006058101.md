   "message": "I was purged, despite having spoken up twice. Instead of getting butthurt about it, I simply joined again, and the Admiral himself accepted me back. I don't feel special.. He probably let me back in for his own amusement to be re purged . Glad to be back, at any rate. Much to read, learn, and do, and not much time to do it.",
