   "message": "The PLAY comes to \"life\" when others consent to the ROLES dictated by the DIRECTORS and PRODUCERS via the SCRIPT WRITER.  If you do not wish to be in the PLAY, do not consent.  Sure, they will do whatever they can to persuade you to participate; fear, fraud, promises (intended to be broken), harassment, and so on.  Fortunately, that still messes up their SCRIPT, which can not proceed as they had originally planned.",
