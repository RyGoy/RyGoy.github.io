   "message": "I think I'm sort of like you Tara, I really don't pay much attention to any \"drama\" on the net.  I just focus on the nuggets and tend to \"listen\" to the gurus and/or those who obviously know what they are talking about.\n\nI've been blocked or deleted (very rare) by only two people on FB and that was mostly for \"personal\" reasons, which really made no sense; I'm truly no threat to anyone.\n\nAs far as an admin blocking or removing a \"member\" from a \"group\", I'm not sure what to say.  I do not oversee a group myself, so I am of the simple opinion that if someone is running \"their group\", s/he can do whatever they dictate; it's their group (don't like it, leave).\n\nBUT, I don't see it really useful or necessary to quickly REMOVE someone, even if they are talking stupid shit.  From what I have observed in other \"groups\", most folks who really should just shut up, show their 'true colors' when attempting to debate in a thread... basically, w/o any help from anyone else, s/he hangs themselves quite neatly.\n\nNow, if that \"member\" is truly disrupting the group, purposely creating chaos and division (ie, troll, agent, or just some loser), well they need to be removed.  No different than in the \"real world\".  If I am in the company of an \"asshole\", I ask them to leave or I just leave the situation myself (most of my experience has proven that these type of \"people\" tend to stay away from me; cause I just ignore them, and most of the time, they are looking for attention).",
