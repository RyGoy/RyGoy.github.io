   "message": "The regular contributors are at the coal face, dealing with real matters in the real world in real time...the learning that comes from doing so is priceless...some have been caged & some have lost property & some have experienced victory.\n\nOnly a fool would block that kind of learning...much the same as only a fool would stand in front of a mirror and punch themself in the face...the regular contributors are fast tracking the learning of others who are not yet ready/confident enough to challenge the status quo.\n\nThe message of the regular contributors is becoming ever more consistent as we deprogram the stupid, learn who we are, what money is & the possibilities this provides...but none of us, with the exception of the admins, Admiral/captains/crew have access to what works consistently...we all have strengths and weaknesses, so the learning process is a collective one.\n\nBlocking Scott and/or other members who have significantly more knowledge and/or experience, in my opinion, takes a special kind of stupid and kind of nullifies the purpose for being in the group in the first place.\n\nThis group is a dictatorship, that is no secret.  We are here as part of an agenda.  We came of our own free will.  \n\nIf the Admins have access to information that shows who blocked who, and if this disrupts the purpose of the group, then the Admins can decide if the party(ies) doing the blocking need to be on the wrong end of the tingly feeling and/or fed to the fish.  I know what I would do, but that is not my decision to make.\n\nIn the meantime, I will continue to study & learn & be thankful for the opportunity to do so.",
