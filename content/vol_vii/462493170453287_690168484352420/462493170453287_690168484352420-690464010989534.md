   "message": "I think I like how the \"blocking\" is already handled. If there IS some one that isn't really understanding what is taught, is just wanting to call people names and/or make unsubstantiated claims, Scott seems pretty \"on it\". Sometimes I do find I skim through some comments, but I haven't found it necessary to block anyone but Adam. That was more because of what I was receiving in my feed than the fact that his comments were barely readable/understandable. \nOthers that block contributing members due to being \"offended\" will just slow their own learning and I don't feel it has effected my learning. I also have no clue who has blocked me except Dean Kory.",
