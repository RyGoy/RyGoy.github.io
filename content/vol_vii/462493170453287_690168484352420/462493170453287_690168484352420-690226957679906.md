Reading every member's post is part of the learning experience at the begining. \n\nAt first I couldn't tell what was \"Scott's way of thinking\" and what was not. After reading more and more I made my own selection WHEN I was reading instead of blocking members (because somtimes that member CAN have a bubble og genius and it would be a shame to miss it).\n\nOr, just imagine someone blocking Pete Daoust when he was just starting. What a waist that member would have had!\n\nI can see the evolution of everyone as well. And that is priceless in my view.\n_______________________\n\nSolution:\n\nLet things as they are.\n\nWho ever bans another, is his own loss.",
