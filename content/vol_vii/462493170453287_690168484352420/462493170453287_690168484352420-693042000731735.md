   "message": "Scott is obviously familiar with the meaning and use of their SCRIPT too.  So many \"believe\" that they can get up on their STAGE, pick their own CHARACTER, begin their own DIALOG and EXPECT that the DIRECTOR will \"go along\" with it.  No.  It does not work that way.  It never has (just look at real history).  The core is the STAGE itself, created by fraud and NOTES that many use, which \"allow\" them to orchestrate elaborate SCENES.  Without such resources, it would be more difficult for them to put this stuff together.  Many are so brainwashed to believe that their PLAY is the only reality that matters, that they continue to do whatever the heck they want.\n\nStop funding their STAGE, PLAY, AND ACTS.  When folks USE their NOTES, that consent perpetuates their FRAUD.  Simply stop.",
