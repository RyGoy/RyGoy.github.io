   "message": "TTfL is about as good as it gets on fbook if you ask me. The elite on here have a joke, the bilge rats on here have a joke, those who think they know something on here have a joke and those who know fukall on here have a joke; but all, at the same time will, when the shit hits the fan, help a member to understand a point that only TTFL can answer. Everything goes here within reason as far as I can see. Notice I only comment on articles like this because I find the other threads absorbing but I don't know enough yet to jump in and comment. Blocking and dismissal is the business of the Admins and they do a good job on those who are afflicted by imaginary friends whether that needs to be extended to others doesn't bother me and if I get the chop then I'll cry around the fire with the two kids for a while and move on.",
