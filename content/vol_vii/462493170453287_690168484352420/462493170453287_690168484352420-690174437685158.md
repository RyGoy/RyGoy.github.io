   "message": "I struggled with this one. Not because I care if someone blocks me (why would any? :P ), but because I have had to use censorship myself in order to have a better learning experience at The Tender For Law.\n\nI do not know how anyone feels about this group, and the knowledge shared, but I have come to take this VERY seriously. To the point of even travelling to Canada, and \"see stuff with my own eyes.\" \n\nBeing so many years under extreme programing, it is hard to \"erase,\" and move to new information, if you still are exposed to the same folks with flaw thinking, like free-dumb types, etc. Some others, like Adam Thomas, made it almost unbearable to read the threads.\n\nAs a result I found myself blocking a few members, like Adam Thomas, and I have had a MUCH better learning experience. It is harder to get distracted, or having to read comment, after comment of none sense.\n\nBut I the same time, I know censorship is not a good thing. :/\n\nThank you for making me THINK, Tara Duncan.",
