   "message": "I have become aware of a curious phenomenon on THE TENDER FOR LAW.\n\nSome of the principal members (don't get your knickers in a knot thinking there's a hierarchy, which there totally is), have mentioned being \"blocked\" by other TTFL members.  \n\nDisclosure: I don't know if anyone has blocked me - I'm sorry I don't pay that much attention.  I don't recall ever blocking anyone.  I have eventually virtually ignored the comments of some people as being functionally \"clutter\", but I'm not a big fan of censorship so I comment, or move on.  Also, FYI, I reject all friend requests to my personal Facebook page even if I like your name, your profile pic, your writing, the cute dog or cat on your wall.  Nothing personal - xenophobia is my bag, baby :D\n\nBut does anyone else see a problem here?\n\nIf you're in this forum it makes no sense not to be able to read the comments of regular contributors.  If you disagree with people's opinions and can't read a thread in context is there really much point in being a member?\n\nI know how I'd solve this problem, but I'd like to hear comments from other contributors.\n\nDo you think members should block other members?\nIf a moderator or regular contributor is blocked by a member, is there any point in the \"blocker\" remaining in the group?\nIf more than one member finds a particular member offensive (that is actually sort of funny), should a moderator remove him/her from the group?\n\nAgain...not a big fan of censorship or dismissal in general, so I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.",
