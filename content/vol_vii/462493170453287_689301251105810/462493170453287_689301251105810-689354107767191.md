   "message": "On June 21st, I said goodbye to my 99 year old grandmother for the last time...I had been saying goodbye to her pretty much every time I saw her since June 2013.\n\nWHY?\n\nBecause she was dying in installments...to use a theistic rationale, her life spirit/soul was leaving her body bit by bit over the course of 12 months.\n\nWhat i saw was an amazing lady slowly deteriorating physically, neurologically and mentally.\n\nIn her lucid moments, she had amazing clarity on life and what came after...she was raised a good Presbyterian.\n\nBy the end of of it all, she KNEW beyond ANY doubt that it was ALL bullshit...she said to ME (not ME to her), don't go wasting your time on any of that religion rubbish.\n\nWhat 'God' that deserves any form of edification would let a lady lose ALL her dignity, as well as her physical and mental faculties, bit by bit, and allow her to suffer needlessly?\n\nShe's gone...end of.\n\nThe only place she lives on is in our collective memories...and we are all cool with that.",
