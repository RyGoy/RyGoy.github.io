   "message": "Seriously though, the whole money is 'debt in transit' concept reminds me of a story I read/heard about the snipers picking off soldiers in the trenches in World War 1:\n\nIf I remember correctly, soldier 1 lights a cigarette, takes a drag, passes it to soldier 2, takes a drag, passes it to soldier 3, taking a drag...BOOM!\n(the cigarette can be likened to the debt in transit)\n\nSoldier 1 & 2, only harm is some ingested carcinogens and some brain, blood and bone fragments on them, but soldier 3, he suffers the full liability...\n\nThat's the way I think of LEGAL TENDER notes these days :/",
