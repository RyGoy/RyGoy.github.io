   "message": "@Marshall Stanton:I can PROVE there is NO GOD/CREATOR. You are all too ignorant at the moment. Most of you can barely add or multiply. You DON'T grasp the exponential function, to the point of hostile avoidance, so we will NEVER have a common frame of reference.\n\nMine is REALITY, yours is supposition and BELIEF based on ignorance. Reality doesn't care if you accept that. ALL BELIEF IS EVIL. Computer science proves THAT too.\n\nMath is the PUREST Science. There is nothing left to discover, only the infinite possibilities of what we know we can DO now.\n\n...or you can think there is a \"creator\" and ignore the begged question \"where did the creator come from\"?",
