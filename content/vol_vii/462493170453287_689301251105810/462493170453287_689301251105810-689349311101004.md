   "message": "'So no, not all theists lack critical thinking and not all atheists possess it by default!'\n\nI would agree with the second part of that statement.\n\nHowever, IF theists do not lack critical thinking, they have failed to apply it to their theistic 'BELIEFS', so it becomes a moot point.\n\nIf you possess it but don't apply it, it is for all intents and purposes the same as not possessing it in the first place.",
