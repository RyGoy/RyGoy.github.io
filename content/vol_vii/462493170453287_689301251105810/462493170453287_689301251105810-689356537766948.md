   "message": "'Show me where it says that mere use of FRNs makes me surety for them. It's not my name on the note. I'm not the one who signed it.'\n\n'This note is legal tender' is pretty clearly displayed (although very small)...we were not taught what that means until now.\n\nThe statutes are the result of accepting that tender.  The person you happen to have is subject to these statutes because they created that person too.\n\nI'm pretty sure you can find the statutes...so to use the analogy from above re the sniper and the soldiers...\n\nyou may just be ingesting some carcinogens, you may just get hit with a bit of brain splatter, or someday, when those debts are being enforced you may be the one whose head goes boom.",
