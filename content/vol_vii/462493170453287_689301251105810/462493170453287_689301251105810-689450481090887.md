   "message": "Im not disputing the tender for law attached to money... When I was last arrested 10 months ago the guards (cops) took ï¿½150 cash from my pocket when searching me in the station. However no charges were ever brought after not giving a name, address etc. \n\nCould my possession of said cash not have been grounds for them to charge me? :-\\",
