   "message": "A friend of mine is being shaken down by his x wife for more child support.  The original issue was settled out of court.  The agreed upon amount was 450 dollars per month.  When my friend is working he has volunteered to pay 700 when he is not collecting Employment Insurance.   Now his x wife has hired a lawyer and is demanding he pay 900 a month.  The lawyer is demanding that he submit his tax assessment from 2013 and 2014.  The criminal Fuck is claiming it has come to his attention that my friend has earned more than is expected.   He is being threatened with a motion in a competent jurisdiction.   I have some ideas but I'll wait for feedback from  the group.",
