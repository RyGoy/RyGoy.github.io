   "message": "The lawyer/liar as I mentioned sent a demand for payment to me for the hearing judgement and he has also sent a notice to my husbands work about garnishing his wages for the original \"default\"...I'm going to forward both to the owner. I would like your thoughts on noticing the liar about my actions. Here is what I was considering sending him. Should I notify him? Thoughts?\n\nRE: CV-14-511029 and 86466/13\n\nWe have administered and forwarded the default judgement and Justice Mew's endorsement to the OWNER (without charge to you,  this time only).As a result, it is our understanding that you should feel no further need to contact us in any capacity except to pay your outstanding balance with us.
