I've put together a notice for the owner and would love any feedback (additions, deletions, misunderstandings that I may have) \n\nNOTICE OF INTENT TO SETTLE COURT FILE CV-14-511026\n\nAttention: Jacques L'Abbe, Deputy Registrar General of Ontario\nCC: Court File CV-14-611026\nCC: Justice Graeme Mew, Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Toronto\n\nWe are an agent of the Sole Authorized Administrator (PPSA Registration Number: xxxxxxxxxxx) of the person known as GAIL MARIE BLACKMAN.  I write this in good faith with the intent to balance the Accounting of Court File CV-14-511026.\n\nThe Account, GAIL MARIE BLACKMAN, was charged and found liable. The woman, gail blackman, does not wish to act as the party with surety in the matter and has notified the Court (file) and Justice Mew. (See enclosed Notice of Mistake).\n.\nIt is our understanding that you are the PRINCIPAL DEBTOR, and as a gesture of good will and good faith, we are forwarding Justice Mew's Endorsement to you with instructions to settle/set off the account. \n\nIt is our understanding that to proceed against a party who doesnï¿½t have surety in the matter is, in fact, fraud.
