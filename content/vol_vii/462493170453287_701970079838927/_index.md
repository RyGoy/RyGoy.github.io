   "message": ".\n. . Any and all demands on me for service by dictators/policy-enforcers must not be forced on me without my consent. That would be slavery. Slavery has been abolished therefore forced service under threat and intimidation is criminal yet still billable. My right to bill for my services rendered whether delivered according to my free will . . or delivered by me against my free will . . is still worthy of my bill to the dictator/policy enforcer for payment by the dictator/policy enforcer. I am unaware of any enforceable law, policy, code, statute, by-law, act or rule that limits what I can charge for my services rendered. . .  SLAVERY HAS BEEN ABOLISHED !",
