   "message": ".\n. . . It's reported by a few so-called journalists writing for the judicial industry that clerks that provide the service of receiving, registering and archiving commercial liens cannot refuse to provide that process to anyone including \"terrorists\" as all commercial liens presented to them at the registry office must be so registered by them. Such clerks (public servants) are considered unqualified, by their colleges in the industry,to determine whether any specific commercial lien is legitimate or illegitimate.\n\nThe \"victims\" of \"bogus\" or \"false\" commercial liens established and presented for registry by the very scary and highly dangerous paper terrorists, seem to be frantically scrambling for relief from the dire circumstances these very fine and honourable \"victims\" find themselves.\n\n I'm thinking these poor \"victims\" either don't remember the various notices they would have received or they are refaining mentioning those documents and communications from the \"terrorists\" as a means of better preserving their angelic and innocent radiance.\n\nThis information I found of value as it enlightens me when considered as a strategic \"indicator\" regarding the power, scope and robustness of commercial liens as a lawful and legal remedy for those in need . . .  even for the lowly terrorist.",
