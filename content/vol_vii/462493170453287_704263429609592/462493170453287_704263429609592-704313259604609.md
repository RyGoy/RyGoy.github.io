   "message": "Let me qualify that. I understand SPELL as being a snap (duration) of time; and when I said \"I've got some wicked spells\" I was assuming that everybody knew. However I admitted some time back that I was born stupid and the Admiral said something to the effect that 'you're fucked, stupid can't be fixed' and of course as you and I know the Admiral doesn't act the Eejit, ever; so I kind of put the spell thing in there to coax John (Greco) to not be afraid to answer the Captains question as there is no mercy in TTFL, (mercy is christendumb sort of imagery); whereas an honest answer (though it may be incorrect) is always tolerated.",
