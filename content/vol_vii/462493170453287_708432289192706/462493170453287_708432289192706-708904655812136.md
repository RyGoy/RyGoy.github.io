   "message": "\"For instance, a \"gram\" (Latin root \"gramma\") is a LEGAL measure of weight.  It always has been. Long before the metric system, a gram was a measure of weight.  It changed over the years and only the NOBILITY standardized it.  Its history nothwithstanding, it is a LEGAL measure of weight - \"Mar\", Latin \"to harm\" - the WEIGHT OF WORDS made with the intention to HARM.  Every lawyer will tell you that good GRAMMAR is important!\"\n\ngram-Mar...i'll never be able to look at this word the same way again. Thanks for this.",
