   "message": "Mackximus Minimus : For 3 yrs playing and only learning that tune I don't mind at all how you like it. I know guys playing 25 yrs wish they could play like I can already on this shit Jupiter tenor. Send me a Selmer and I'll record a better version for you. Those recordings are only there for ex work-colleagues and friends to hear my progress because I couldn't play not very long ago.. Most of them seem to think I am doing incredibly well since I never had any lessons. My lessons are listening to Michael Brecker and David Sanborn. This is a better one:http://www.reverbnation.com/damienduffy/song/20565460-the-cat-is-king and this: http://www.reverbnation.com/damienduffy/song/20670020-both-sides . When I consider my playing to be mature I may return and then ask you your opinion.",
