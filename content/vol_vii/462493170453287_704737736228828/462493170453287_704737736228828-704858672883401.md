   "message": "No you would not use A.R. (authorized REPRESENTATIVE) Damien Duffy. Why do you say this? Do you think this means the same thing as SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for LEE EDGELY. What Lee Edgely has talked about is how to sign, not how to fill out an application. This looks like a shitstain. Nobody can tell someone  how to sign anything. Doing so removes any VOLUNTARY from signing. This is what is meant by \"under constraint\".",
