   "message": "Why? because it beng the best I have found so far. Better than signing AS THE NAME in any case. I have not previously encountered SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR. Yes it seems better than A.R. They will cut it out anyway. We are dealing with pirates. I seem to feel that certain paperwork must be in order to put \"SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR\" is that so? Or are we entitled because the NAME is a PRINCIPAL EMBODIMENT? If we are trustee of the birth certificate (state property) can we be administrator also? Which is it? principal embodiment, or state property? Is it state property by presumption only? I have looked at Frank O'collins \"general executor\" role and that indeed requires much process. Thank you for engaging any misunderstanding I may have transmitted.",
