   "message": "How can you apply under duress without a gun to your head? Regardless of the piracy of the DVLA, I think you might more correctly put A.R. because you ARE the authorised representative for the NAME, but of course when stopped you are NOT THE NAME. Of course you need to hold the license in case you ever need to operate in commerce under the aupices of the government, but when you are not doing so it is of no relavance to you. Except they won't taser you for not having one. What a load of crap the world is with these lunatics in charge. They will still cut the A.R. from the signature.",
