   "message": "\" Folks may have APPLIED for the DRIVER\"S LICENCE but it was not done with FULL DISCLOSURE. Therefore UNDERSTANDING what one was asking/CONTRACTing for would be impossible.\"\n\n Except that as the Scottism goes: \"none of this is hidden\". The fact that no one reads the MOTOR VEHICLE ACT before signing is simply ignorance on their part. Signing a contract without reading all of the fine print first is just a dumb idea.\n\n Since you all clearly missed it the other day, I'll let Kyle explain why that is :p\n\nhttp://vimeo.com/24782590",
