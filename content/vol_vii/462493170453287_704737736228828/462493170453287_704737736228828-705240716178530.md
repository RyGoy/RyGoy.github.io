   "message": "\"When you sign, you are agree to be the recognized as the person, an agent, surety, and to let them use everything you voluntarily give them to identify YOU as such.\"\n\nWhere in the Highway Traffic Act (HTA) is DISCLOSURE given saying that I agreed to be recognized as the PERSON, or an AGENT, or even as SURETY? I admit I would not have known what any of these things  meant then... I also agree that I had never read the HTA and that signing anything without reading the fine print is a BAD idea, but can someone show me where it explicitely DISCLOSES that these three things were being agreed to?",
