Therefore UNDERSTANDING what one was asking/CONTRACTing for would be impossible. This DRIVER'S LICENCE is used as evidence allowing GOVERNMENT/COURTS/POLICE to take the presumption that a man IS the PERSON and present it as a FACT. This is IMPOSSIBLE and is the core of the ACT of deception and is a LIE. Since \"mistakes can be corrected\" how does one correct this mistake then?",
