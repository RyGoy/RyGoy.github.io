   "message": "Filing a UCC or PPSA, evidence of a lien, without a valid contract recognized by the courts is frivolous and an abuse of the system. If you have a valid contract you likely don't need a lien because you can sue and get a judgment then garnish wages and seize assets with the help of the court and sheriff. The only time you might need a lien is if the target has a statutorily-protected asset, like a principal residence, and you need to wait for them to sell it to get paid.",
