   "message": "Three of Toronto's finest who recently verbally accosted me, responded to my \"I don't want to enter into contract with you. If you force me into contract I will expect you to pay me for my services rendered. Do you understand what I said?\" . .  with blank looks on their faces. But they all left me at peace after uttering hollow threats of  \"charges.\" It will be good if I can serve a forceful, intimidating policy enforcer's employer, bank, tenant with garnishee documents based on a commercial lien that I have processed regarding my fees for services rendered in a \"forced\" contract. I will investigate!",
