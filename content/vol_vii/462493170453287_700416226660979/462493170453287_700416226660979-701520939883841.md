   "message": "Gail Marie et al.  . . Hiding & shielding assets . .  Not to mention offshore secret accounts in Swiss, Turks & Caicos, Cayman Islands, banks etc. in the past I've brought those who owed me fees, rents and such to court. Most didn't show up and thus I secured a \"judgement\". I paid other fees to get garnishee based on the judgements. I would call the banks near their workplaces and homes to inquire whether they had an account there and also wait out to see them leave their homes for work in the morning to follow them and find out where they worked. I would serve the garnishee documents on the employees and banks and then receive what was due. I am investigating whether I can get garnishee documents based on a commercial lien.",
