   "message": "Satement: A monthly report sent to a debtor or bank depositor.\n\nThe BOTTOM part of that statement, is a Bill of Exchange with a DEBT attached to it, announcing that some books needs to get balanced\n\nI can see the BENEFICIARY of that bill, which is TELUS\nI can see the DRAWER of that Bill, that has been scratched with a marker\n\nI have NO IDEA who is the Drawee, that information is missing on that bill.\n\nSomeone have to buy that debt and PAY for it, unless there is another method to discharge that debt. TELUS should know if there's another method :D",
