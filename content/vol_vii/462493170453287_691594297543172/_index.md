   "message": "My son went to Central America for a month and when he was there, his phone got stolen.\n\nWhere he was, the internet connections were not available. So as soon as he got back, he called Telus and told them about it.\n\nThey said: \"you should have called when you lost it\"! despite the fact that he explained that it was impossible to do so where he was, they said he owed them ï¿½ 3000$ for the account! :(\n\nSo he dealed a settlement with them reducing the debt a little bit.\nBut at the light of what he learned, he then sent a letter asking for the different methodes of payments available to him to take care of the debt, in the delays required.\n\nToday he got cut off.\n\nHe called Telus and asked WHY they had cut off the phone since (explained what he had done) and of course they did because he hadn't PAID.\n\nSo he went down to his mail box and saw that he had a coupon from the postal office saying that he had received a Registered Mail Letter and that it would be available for him to pick up tomorrow.\n___________________________________\n\nSo we are wondering, since he want to PAY what he used (his package price) but doesn't want to mix the PAYING part and the ADMINISTRATION part, can he call them and PAY what he used and deal with the rest by Mail?\n\nAlso, can he fax them a NOTICE saying that they do not have the right to cut him off because he was in his delay and that he will pay, the usage he did of it by Credit Card?\n\nCan someone guide me on this?",
