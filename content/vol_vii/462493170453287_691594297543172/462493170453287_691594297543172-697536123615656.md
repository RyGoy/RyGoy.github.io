   "message": "Pete, I,m just reading the definition again of the link I just posted above, and this sentence:\n\n\"writing by a party (maker or drawer) ordering another (payor) to pay a certain amount to a third party (payee). It is the same as a draft. \"\n\n... makes me think that the criminal charges are not to be aimed at HQ but to whom ever didn't OBEY the ORDERS. \n\nSince the DRAWER is ORDERING the PAYOR, wouldn't it be correct to say that The Bank of Canada is the one you should be focusing on?\n\nEven the guy from HQ told you to notify the Bank, didn't he?",
