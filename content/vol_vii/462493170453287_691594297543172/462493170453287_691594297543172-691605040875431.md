   "message": "When the local internet network was hacked and they stole upwards of 160 gb per day, I contacted Videotron, explained them who I was, that I had a PERSON, that that PERSON's been a customer there for 15 years and always administrated the account FLAWLESSLY, I told them I didnt want them to have to pay for that theft / fraud, but neither was I going to pay for that. When something gets stolen, you call the police, and it so happens that the police in Quebec is the SURETY du QUEBEC... \n\nSo any theft or fraud must be a matter of surety, and you have the RIGHT to your PERSON's SURETY...\n\nWe played ball back and forth for 3 months, then they finally decided to ERASE THE DEBT... Go figure out !\n\nSo if I were you, I'd play this honestly, you MUST act politely until they treat you like shit first, you must tell them you'll do everything to make sure they dont have to absorb any consequences, you can also tell them that it's not like they sell cars and you stole a few of those, they sell AIR, and they ADVERTISE to get new clients SO they should be able to absorb the extra data transfer... \n\nBut first call and ask them to get the service back right away, explain you didnt get the bill sooner or whatever, remind them the bills have always been paid roght away, be nice with wthem and tell them that you're going to be administrating this matter immediately. Explain EVERYTHING, that its not your fault, etc... And stamp the shit out of the bill they will send, birth certificate, registered mail, ASK QUESTIONS, ask them to REBUTE ANYTHING YOU SAY THAT COULD BE WRONG OR NOT TRUE and wait...\n\nWrite your letter down, and when you're done, if you wish I can show you what I sent VIDEOTRON, so you can compare and learn / tweak / whatever if you're not sure what to say or how to say it or in what order...",
