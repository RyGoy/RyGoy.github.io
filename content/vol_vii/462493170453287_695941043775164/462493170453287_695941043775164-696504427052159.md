   "message": "I have a book here called \"the Canadian Legal System\" written by a sack of shit liar, Gerald L. Gall, third edition, (you think that after the first 2 he would get it right) and in the foreword, written by another sack of shit \"Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, Charles D Gonthier, he uses the word \"JUDGE\" and \"JUDGES\" exclusively when referring to the cross dresser on the bench and then quotes Justice when referring to a specific sack of shit. This trend is carried on through out this club house doctrine. \nChapter nine: The Role of Judges and Lawyers.\nJUDGES: 1 The appointment of Judges\n2 The removal of Judges.\nLinguistically Deceptive, indeed.\nThese fucking Liars should have a facebook page dedicated to them and how to fuck them up! The reason we need an international kick a lawyer in the groin and then stomp their fucking heads till they stop moving. Or something similar.",
