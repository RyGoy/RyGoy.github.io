   "message": "As the Law Times reported, Superior Court Justice Ian Nordheimer said Ritchie�s actions would leave an observer �with the distinct impression that that trial judge had predetermined the result of the � application, if not the likely outcome of the proceeding as a whole.� Remember that it is very important that no observer be given this impression, even though this is the REALITY, since it undermines the entire ACT, credibility of the system, and all the ACTors playing in it.",
