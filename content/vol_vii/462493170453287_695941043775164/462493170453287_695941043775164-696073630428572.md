   "message": "\"Toronto constitutional lawyer Rocco Galati\" in my opinion is out of date when he refers to justices as judges as according to the Admiral (I feel a peeper peeping and I hope he doesn't come out and cause a shit stain) there are no judges only justices; forgive me if I'm wrong folks. but why would a lawyer call a justice a judge?",
