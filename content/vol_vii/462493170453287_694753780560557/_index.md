   "message": "Anyone familiar with estate law? My question is, as executor of my mother's will I wish to sell the real estate to a buyer. There are 6 beneficiaries to the will myself included. Do I need to register the beneficiaries as owners first then sell it on or can I transfer ownership directly from my Mother's name to the buyer along with a notice of assent from the beneficiaries... \n\nI know the legalities will differ from country to country so I've added the section from the Irish act that pertains to it... The legalese confuses me though so if someone could translate please... :/",
