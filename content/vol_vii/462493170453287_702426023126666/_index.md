   "message": "Exciting times ahead. It's moving day :) out from under the many thumbs that would stear my vessel to shallow shoals. No lease, no utilities to pay, studio/bachelor in the market of my berth. \n\nI will first get comfortable.\nThen I kill my person, resign via extreme detachment. New accounts for ESC CTRL and FAR ARDEN. I never want to hear THAT name again.\nThen I gather the folks I need to build a wireless mesh network, no permits, everything off the shelf pirate radio style, encrypted.\nRunning in the back ground, the answer to everything. Learn and apply, Ethereum, Maidsafe, TOR and coding. \n\nThis is the greatest adventure I have ever been on, and its just beginning, thank you all, forward we go",
