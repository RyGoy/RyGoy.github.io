   "message": "Please correct me if I am wrong.....\n\nIt is my understanding that a corporation is a type of company or business entity which is entitled to treatment as an artificial person which can sue and be sued in a court, and which has liability protection for its shareholders and officers.\nWhen I look at information on a Limited Liability Company though, it looks like a much better setup to me in terms of privacy etcetera, but I am not seeing anywhere that it can be treated as an artificial person and able to sue/be sued.\nIs it the case that an LLC is NOT an artificial person?\nIf it is NOT a person, then it follows that it cannot create a trust?",
