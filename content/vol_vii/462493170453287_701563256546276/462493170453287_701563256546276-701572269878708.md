   "message": "An LLC and a trust both provide benefits to the owner of REAL PROPERTY.  Using both a trust and a LLC is the best combination of liability protection and estate planning. To do this, the owner should hold the investment property in a single member LLC, with the living trust as the sole member of the LLC. Here, the trust is the owner of the company and holds all of the interests of the LLC. This form of ownership gives you an added layer of protection from the LLC as well as the additional estate planning benefits of a trust.",
