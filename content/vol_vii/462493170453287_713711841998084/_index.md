   "message": "Talked to a nice man yesterday. He informed me that in Detroit there are kids with semi automatic weapons that are apart of gangs that roam the streets and scope out on rooftops.\n\nI replied \"You're kidding...\"\n\nAlso, the city shuts down power to blocks and blocks of homes at night. Because the city is \"so broke\".\n\nI guess I didn't know how bad things were really getting in the US.\n\nFrom Norah Holloway.",
