   "message": "Alright Pete thought I should share this :)\n\nThis is after a third letter to QRA about using the PERSON'S SURETY vs income tax...\n\nTalked to 2 ladies at QRA over the phone yesterday, who both seemed pretty lost, even though they DID seem to understand that I was NOT the PERSON, that I wish they dont call me MISTER \"FIRST NAME LAST NAME TITLE\" (one of them even said \"ok William but this call is being recorded and I must say \"VOUS\" and \"MISTER\", to which I replied \"then each time I'll have to correct you on this\"), that I HAVE a tax payer but I'm not the tax payer... I even had that girl lookup the legal definition of SURETY and read Article I of the Qc Charter while over the phone, I literally explained EVERYTHING to her... and at some point she said \"I dont think I'm able to answer this question, but here's the number to talk to an agent who will be qualified to do it...\" (Second lady)\n\nSome times I wonder what those ladies tell to their man and kids when they get home about that guy who called and said he was not the person ?\n\nLong story short, they left a voice message this morning :\n\"Unfortunately, we cannot handle your request\"\n\nWhat's so hard ?\n\"Is it TRUE that I have the RIGHT to administrate those public debts through the PERSON's SURETY ?\" \nYes or no ??\n\nSo I guess I'll soon be preparing a preremptory notice... Just after I'm done writing up to Heath Insurance \"hey which date of birth they want on your form ??\"\n\nAnd I know I know I need a new phone with a recorder app :/",
