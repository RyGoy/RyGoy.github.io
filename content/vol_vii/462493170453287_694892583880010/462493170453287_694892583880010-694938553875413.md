   "message": "I have seen this same thing Pete from the ONTARIO COURT of INJUSTICE (OCJ) regarding a date for trial in TRAFFIC COURT. There are three possible TITLES beneath the signature line but no name, no one specific title and a squiggle for a signature. I imagine that HQ like the OCJ does not want its agents to be identified lest they end up being sued personally. Makes you wonder what they're afraid of?",
