   "message": "Michael Atkins : \"We all think that they were originally paid by Bank of Canada. Then you filled out the Bills of Exchange correctly and those were also sold. So now are these con artists going to somehow sell this presumed debt to HQ to a 3rd party.\" Michael forgive me I'm new but that is only presumption. Why would HQ collect twice on this transaction and then cut of PETE (THE PERSON)'S electric? This is a great deal for them so far according to that presumption and if Pete also payed on top of this as surety for the PERSON it would be win win win for HQ so cutting him off would have been a stupid move? I don't know but there is something sinister going on here perhaps??",
