   "message": "Funny, received this letter today from HQ, basically saying that they are finished with this and it's up to me if I want to COMPLAINT to the regie of energy.\n\nThe subject of this letter is:\nYOUR BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND THE SERVICE CUT OFF FOR NON PAYMENT.\n\nOf course they haven't sent back the negotiable instruments, and this envelop was sent regular mail, so of course I videotaped myself while opening the envelop, to make sure no one will affirm that the instruments was in it.\n\nAnd this wet ink signature of a no name agent caught my curiosity, Scott, WHY a no name agent would sign this without his name written on this thing ? :-\\",
