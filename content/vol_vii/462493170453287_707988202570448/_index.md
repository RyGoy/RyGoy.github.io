   "message": "So I renewed an expired driving license today... Very difficult to consciously request permission from the club to do something having learned so much here and being of a nature that loathes the presumption of authority over me ... :/\n\nIt also got me thinking about checkpoints/road stops by cops on the roads.\n\nThe legislation that they are acting upon is all passed by \"The Oireachtas\" (The Irish Houses of Parliament). It is then signed into \"law\" by their president \"The President of Ireland\"...\n\nThe OIreachtas is a company listed with Dunn & Bradstreet...\n\nSo, are all state departments merely a form of sub-contractor for the Oireachtas? Carrying out work as per the legislation and taking a cut for their services? i.e. A Guard/Cop checkpoint...\n\n(I've also added a snippet from the application form for the license... You can imagine how it felt so wrong filling this thing out but I need to have no hassle on the roads for my job)...",
