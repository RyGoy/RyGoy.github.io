   "message": "Pete stated the following \"If you QUESTION, and point out the birth date of that LEGAL NAME, being different from the MAN's birth date, you will create some MISUNDERSTANDING from you the man, in regards to the SURETY of the PERSON, whoever/whatever PERSON created from the FOUNDATION document, which is the Birth Certificate.\n\nIn other words, you don't understand WHY the man's birth date should be used, instead of the person's birth date. You use the registered mail system to QUESTION this matter, so you have a RECORD that the question has been addressed, and never answered, that will give you extra tools, for future fuck ups.....\"",
