   "message": "All <they> (highway robbers masked as Peace officers - be sure to reserve all rights and the unlimited right to counter-offer)   want to see is the driver's pilot's full liability insurance, which can be in your commercial entity's name.\"\n\n Professor Webb has put the position this way (\"Regulatory Offences, the Mental Element and the Charter: Rough Road Ahead\" (1989), 21 Ottawa L. Rev. 419, at p. 452):\n\n\"The fact that a strict liability offence is a component in a larger regulatory system justifies the assumption that as a pre-condition to engaging in regulated activity, regulatees have been made aware of the standards which they must meet, and accept that should their conduct fall below these standards, they may be subject to penalties pursuant to procedures which reflect their special position as regulatees.\"",
