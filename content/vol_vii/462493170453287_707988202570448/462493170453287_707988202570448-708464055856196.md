   "message": "Eamonn, \n\nI know what you mean, and I understand your position\n\nIt�s ok to do what needs to be done, in order to stay alive�\n\nBut since you now HAVE this LICENSE, and it�s SAFE to drive on these roads, that seems to have been highjacked by some BANKERS, nothing prevents you to ASK a question to those who sold you that perrmit.\n\nHere�s what I am thinking about,\n\nDear permit sellers,\n\nRecently, I applied for that permit, and now I just discovered that I have put MY date of birth on it, and since it�s very clear that this permit and/or license has been delivered to the PERSON I happen to have, which is EAMONN O�BRIEN,  I am just wondering if the date of birth of the person EAMONN O�BRIEN should have been the one to put on this form, instead of MY date of birth.\n\nEAMONN O�BRIEN was created the XX of the month XX, 19XX, and I, the man, was born a few days before, the XX of the month XX, 19XX.\n\nSo, since I want to make sure that there�s no fraudulent information on this form, and want to avoid any MISTAKES, could you please confirm to me that I have not put the wrong information on this form.\n\nMy Date of birth is XX/XX/XX\nEAMONN O�BRIEN was created XX/XX/XX\n\nThanks for your quick reply,\n\nSole Authorized Administrator for\nEAMONN O�BRIEN Registration no. XXXXXXXX\n\nSo that way, if EAMONN O'BRIEN receives a public debt, from some OFFENSE, you will have an UNDERTAKING, and will be able to DISCHARGE that public debt through EAMONN O'BRIEN's surety :D :D\n\n:D",
