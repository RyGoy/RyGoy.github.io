   "message": "Good morning. Following from my previous posts from a few weeks ago, I have submitted my application form to The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade this morning. The application was accepted and my signature was questioned, \"Why have I signed it Sole Authorised Administrator\". I responded, 'I am a man and the passport is for the person I happen to have'. No response from the other side of the window :-). I also questioned which date of birth I was supposed to use and the woman just filled my date of birth not the persons. I also stated the birth certificate is an important document and she just smiled at me without saying a word. All going well I will have by 3:30pm today. Thanks",
