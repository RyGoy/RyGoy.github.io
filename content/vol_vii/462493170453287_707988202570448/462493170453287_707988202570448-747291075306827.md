   "message": "The new Passport I have for the PERSON I happen to have, BARTHOLOMEW JOHN FOLEY, has no signature on it. My old one did. There is a panel, but not on the machine readable section which has a dotted line and signature on it an a little 10 over it. Every line has a number over it. How would you suggest I sign it Scott Duncan and or Tara Duncan and or Pete Daoust. Should I just sign it SOLE AUTHORISED ADMINISTRATOR?",
