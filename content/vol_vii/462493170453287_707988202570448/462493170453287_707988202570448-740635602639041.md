   "message": "Since I am changing information that will appear on the new passport of the person I happen to have, I have to submit the birth certificate that I am the beneficiary off (I have a letter of authentication, certified by an authorised officer, birth certificate is on security paper, with an embossed seal, and it has a watermark containing the four harps ). I have an appointment to get it notarised at 3:30 pm today. I asked can I get several notarised copies and they stated that they will email me the one notarised copy which I will have for my records and be able to print off for all future needs and / or requirements. Cost ï¿½45. I will also need a notarised copy of my birth certificate when I change my driver licence etc. B",
