   "message": "If not longer! I still feel bad as I cannot give him that time back .I offered throat lozenges cause his throat must have been sore from yelling at stupid me for so long but I deserved every bit of it and more! You all don't realise how much time and effort the Admiral puts into what he does for us. I know it serves his agenda also but it is a lot to deal with the \"the sleeping stupid\" on a day to day basis. And for this , I offer my sincerest gratitude ! THANKS Tara for taking care of the admiral and keeping him in good health , we the \"stoopid\" are truly grateful!",
