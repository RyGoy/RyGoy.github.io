That was a long time ago.\n\n I'm really thankfull to be in this group.\n\nWhen you keep in mind that's it's all about SURETY and ACCOUNTING, the world we live in starts to make sense.\n\nI know i don't say much, but i'm in here everyday reading.\n\nTrying to explain this to friends and family is what helps me to understand the things that are taught in here better.\n\nUnfortunately most folks (most of them with beliefs) look at you like:\" Are you crazy?\". \n\nI kind of understand now why Scott wants to kill us all. :D",
