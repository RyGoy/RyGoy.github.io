   "message": "Dru Klotz there is no space to be double minded. You cannot possible be liked by everyone, especially is you stand by the TRUTH. Not everyone has to be your friend. Feeling pressured to be liked makes you tell LIES, as telling Trent (even after being in this group) that you found VALUE in his stuff. And that is a LIE! There is NO VALUE. You would have to explain that one here, and I find that a very difficult task to do.\n\nBeing around the same people that are not thinking right, makes it harder to leave the programing. If you are in Sui Juris, and Freeman groups, you will be exposed to information that will keep re-enforcing the programing. And being \"friends\" with people that mean HARM to folks like ME, and others here, makes you an enabler.\n\nYou do not get to have a perfect cake (The Tender for Law), and then put shit frosting over it. Because, in REALITY, you will still end-up eating a shit frosted cake. It's not a real dessert.\n\nIt's MANY years of programming, it does not get shaken down just by admitting you are programed, and keep doing the same things. I had to shut down those windows of distraction, and it has served me well.\n\nI know you want to learn, Dru, but it's time to step-up the game, if many of you want to remain here.",
