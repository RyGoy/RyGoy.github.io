But man, you guys rock with the knowledge.  I enjoy reading posts here, and continue to learn.  So I remain silent, keep reading, listening and soaking it all in.     I know what a person is \"one who wears a mask, primarily an actor on stage\"   Time I wrote my own script and give life to me, not a fictional entity. Thanks guys, and it is an honor to be part of this group.  and oh ya, has anyone noticed on you're bith cert, it says \"bank of Canada\"? on the back in really small print?  hmmmmm ever wonder what the bank of canada wants with you're BC? once again, thanks for letting me be a part of this group",
