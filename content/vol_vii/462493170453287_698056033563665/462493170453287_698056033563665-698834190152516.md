   "message": "I've been here reading, studying and re-reading. Filling in the blanks of many missing pieces. Oh and getting rid of the stupid little by little.\n\nMy only reason for getting on facebook anymore is this group. So over all the other BS. I have been quietly observing. I didn't want to leave any stains of shit for others to stumble over. I find the Information here very valuable. Many questions have been answered in the comments in past threads. Just trying to get my dots connected and head wrapped \naround things better. Reading up more on trusts and administrating.\n\nI would like to thank Scott and Tara for the brilliant writings and sharing them with us. I will do my best to teach others what I learn and/or re-learned.\n  \nThanks to Pete, Ceit, Mackximus, Chris, Beverly and others for all the comments, questions and points of view to help adjust and re-think my thinkings. Looking forward to the upcoming articles and to participate in the group soon.",
