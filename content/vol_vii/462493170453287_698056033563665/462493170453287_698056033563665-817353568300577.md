   "message": "The Quatloos lawyers have never presented a case against \"Scott Duncan\". The best they can do, as I have read quite a bit (I like reading Quatloos, by the way. You can learn a lot, not only of what they say, but mostly what they DON'T say), is throw crazy punches like: \"AB ORIGINAL, the typical freeman of playing with words\", of something like that. I have NEVER read them say \" SURETY? What the fuck is that? Scott is wrong!\" It's always things to make Scott look like a childish brat, that fights online with Robert Menard, and brags about being \"always right\". But when you distill everything they say, they've got nothing.",
