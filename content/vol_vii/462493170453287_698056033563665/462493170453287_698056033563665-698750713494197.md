   "message": "\"The Tender for Law group is VERY precious to me\" Pete Daoust\nREAD THIS sentence above again. Then let it sink in. \nI don't know that any \"dedicated\" member could feel any other way, especially if you have been exposed to FREE-DUUUMB lies previously. \n\nI've read a few comments here from passengers doubling as baggage who are too afraid to step up because they feel fucking vulnerable in the knowledge that they are IDIOTS and part of the problem. So they \"lurk\", contribute nothing, and sponge off the energy of others. How is this any different than the majority of fucking debtors that surround us? \n\nThe TTFL is as real as it gets and if you free time is not consumed by the upgrading and reprogramming made available to folks here then you are not serious about changing that you THINK WRONG and value the wrong things. This and this alone is to blame for this system that is designed to harm mankind. The information offered here is about MUCH more than any of us. \n\nIf this does not motivate you then you should not wait to be PURGED and willingly go back to that pathetic state of normalcy that most folks accept as reality. But do so knowing that you have only missed everything that would have made a diference. This rant was not intended but I needed to get this off my chest.",
