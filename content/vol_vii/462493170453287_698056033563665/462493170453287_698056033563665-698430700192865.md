   "message": "Cristian Cambiazo, the evidence is pretty plain to see.\n\nIf you haven't yet seen it, go on a brief journey of discovery:\n\nPull out the birth certificate.\n\nLook at the top to see who owns it (the one I hold says New South Wales Dept of Births Deaths and Marriages).\n\nSee where YOUR signature appears or where YOUR creators (Mum and/or Dad) signed it: they didn't, you didn't...so unless someone else can enter into binding contracts on your behalf, then that thing isn't yours.\n\nThe date of its' creation is not the same as the day you are purported to have come in the world (the one I hold was created 17 days after I arrived).\n\nThe only signature on it appears to be from the registrar.\n\nThe fact I hold it and no one else can hold the same certificate, means that I am the sole authorised one to hold it: ie: sole authorised.\n\nWhy am i holding it?\nIf it's not me and it's not mine, then I MUST be doing something with it for the owners:\n\nEither: 1.  Buying back debts accrued against that name.\n2.  Acting as an administrator for the name.\n\nThere really aren't any other possible scenarios.\n\nBUT; if you're still hung up thinking it's yours (along with YOUR drivers licence and YOUR passport), try selling it to someone else to use...the consequences of such an action will make it VERY clear VERY quickly that it is NOT YOURS to sell.\n\nSo, You have it to use, even though it's not Yours.",
