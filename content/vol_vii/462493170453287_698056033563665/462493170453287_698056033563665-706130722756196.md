   "message": "Happy to be welcome here and I appreciate having access to the truth.  Against my better judgement I dated a Christian once, even though she took off her jesus necklace when we banged and kept her beliefs to her self I just couldn't take it.  I had a conversation with her parents once about beliefs and how I didn't have any.  They couldn't understand how I could have no beliefs.  The truth is what I've always been after, as far back as I can remember :-)",
