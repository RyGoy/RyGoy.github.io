PLEASE FORGIVE ME.\n\nI spend a lot of time here, the only thing of VALUE I have, and yet.. \n\nde�lin�quent \nadjective  1. failing in or neglectful of a duty or obligation; guilty of a misdeed or offense. 2. (of an account, tax, debt, etc.) past due; overdue. 3. of or pertaining to delinquents or delinquency: delinquent attitudes.\n\n... again, PLEASE FORGIVE ME.\n\nI APPRECIATE all the time and effort that is put into this group, by the active members.\nPete Daoust's simple methodical approach shows why he is at the top of the class. Mackximus Minimus, Ceit Butler, Gail Marie, Chris Evan, David Vilaca, Beverly Berta Braakschmack, Eamonn O Brien, Stuart Stone, Will Bed, Tara Duncan, Kent Barrett, Aladdin Sane, Jesse Alexander and others..\n\nI admire Scott Duncan very much. He directs me to focus on the right things. I haven't said a word in here and yet I think about this place often.. when I'm not here reading.\n\nI'd like to continue learning.",
