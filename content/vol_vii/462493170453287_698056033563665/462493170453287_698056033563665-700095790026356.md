   "message": "I truly appreciate being here. I've come to learn that I was a deluded \"know it all\" that in fact could barely tie my own shoes. What a relief it's been to discover what a valueless idiot I've been.\n\nI have largely been silent on this forum since my return as I'm aware that I still have a fair bit of catching up to do and wish to avoid creating purge-worthy shit stains. But that doesn't mean I'm not devouring and hanging on for dear life to every bit of info presented here.\n\nI do appreciate everything that you, Tara, and the admins (as well as many of the \"regulars\") offer here, as I find it has REAL VALUE for me and others; value that simply cannot be obtained anywhere else.\n\nI've been in a few scary scenarios before, but few have matched the fear that I get at the thought of NOT being able to continue to learn from you Scott (and others mentioned above).\n\nI am studying everything I can get my hands on regarding TRUSTS and have recently designed a legal seal.\n\nMy posts elsewhere on FB will demonstrate just how highly I think of you Scott. I praise, respect, and share your knowledge and insights all over FB and am a regular contributor/sharer to/of Reasons We Need A National Kick a Cop in the Face Day.\n\nIn brief - you're way better than Jesus and his Sky Daddy. :D",
