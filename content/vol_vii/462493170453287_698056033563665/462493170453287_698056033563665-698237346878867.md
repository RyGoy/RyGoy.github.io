   "message": "Thank you Admiral Scott and the crew of the tender for Law. I have been apart of this revolution only a short period of time and I have done very little else for weeks but read, learn and recondition my way of thinking from all the freedumb nonsense i have expended so much time on in the past,  knowing something was not right with it. I am so grateful and humble for the immense work undertaken by Scott to teach people how to become the sole authorized administrator of the person they have and to start fixing the inequality in the world. I hope to continue learning Admiral / Sir into the future.",
