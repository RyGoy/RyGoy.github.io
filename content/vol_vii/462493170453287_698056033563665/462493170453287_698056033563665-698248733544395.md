   "message": "I do not desire to be liked by everyone, we agree on that. I also agree that inaccurate and imagined concepts not backed with FACT cause HARM.\nI find value in every experience. Sure, that dog on the other side of the fence, is wagging his tail and has his tongue hanging from the side his mouth(the Polite Believer). But the moment you allow BELIEF to fill you into entering the yard without FACT(the owner of said dog). That, what you believed was a nice dog wagging its tail, becomes a very functional detriment to the believers well being(The HARM of BELIEF taking place). There is value is finally realizing that you were thinking wrong. \nMuch like the when the Admin of The Tender For Law group allow believers of Imaginary Sky Daddies into the group. The VALUE is in exposing the depth of the HARM that said belief does to those it has contact with. As well as showing us newbies how to address belief.\nSince being allowed into the group, The Tender For Law group has been THE source of my KNOWLEDGE. It has VALUE unparalleled.",
