You HAVE a PERSON.\n\nThis was NOT a choice you made, and it's not your FAULT!\n\nYou have the RIGHT TO \"SECURITY OF THE PERSON\"! THIS DOES NOT MEAN WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS! THIS IS A LEGAL DECLARATION.\n\nNOWHERE does it say the GOVERNMENT has the right to \"SECURE THE PERSON\".\n\nYOU DECIDE what happens to your person, just like YOU DECIDE what happens to that $10.00 bill in your wallet, even though it's NOT YOURS.\n\nIT'S YOUR RIGHT !!\n\nScott Duncan",
