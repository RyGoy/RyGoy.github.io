   "message": "I will also take this opportunity to publicly apologize to Scott for taking away quite a few hours of his life that he will never get back helping a retard like myself . A word of advice to all the newbies and anyone else that doesn't realize it like I didn't until after my \" ass \" surgery by Scott . Every single word in his writings and posts by others that are allowed into this forum are extremely valuable and need to be treated as such . I am now taking my time and deciphering what every single word means and re reading everything I look at a hundred times if I have to until it sinks into my big fat skull and stays put ! Thanks Scott again, I appreciated that talk more than you will ever know !",
