   "message": "Thank you, Mackximus Minimus, I sure did. I also said (this I cannot quote as I am not as certain of the exact wording) that I found it odd to be selling the truth. The theme of my conversation was leading to discrediting Gougebaudy, albeit in a mild mannered fashion, and surprise surprise Trent banned me before I could put the delicious coconut oil icing onto the cake.\nI will not be so time consuming in the future. \nIf there is one thing that I have learned from The Tender For Law group it is that the TRUTH need not be gentle or subtle. Mother Nature sure is not; 99.9999(with some more 9's)% of everything that has ever existed has gone extinct. Mother Nature does not hold back any punches; that bitch loves to kill the unworthy(unfit).",
