   "message": "But, is not a \"human being\" a kind of PERSON? A NATURAL PERSON, defined as a \"real human being,\" is ENTITLED to those benefits. A man is not ENTITLED to PUBLIC BENEFITS, right? \n\nI just cannot see the MAN being ENTITLED to a \"right\" that was created by other men. :/ There is NO discussion that MAN is not part of the equation here, to ME. \n\nIf there is such thing as \"rights,\" mine do not come from other men. But the REALITY is that a MAN is in this world, just like any other animal, on his own!",
