   "message": "Admittedly, I felt panic when I first heard of the purge, as I had finally found a place that, while holding you accountable for your shitstains, and not being nice to idiots( who cares about nice), you ( and by YOU, I mean ME)actually tells you the truth. Assumed authority lies.. Gurus lie... Idiots lie whilst believing it to be truth... Maybe I'll get purged.. Maybe I won't. The truth is still the truth, and if the desire and drive is there, any path I take will eventually lead me there. The only problem I can foresee is not enough time to take the scenic route( too much time to wade through the bullshit)",
