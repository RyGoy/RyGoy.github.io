   "message": "Dear Scott Duncan:  I would very much like to remain a member of THE TENDER FOR LAW.   On the plus side I have a very cute icon, can read and can also \"conversate\" pretty basic.  On the negative side I did once run over a family of skunks, but I was much younger then, and in fairness it was a mistake.  Please forgive me.  Again on the plus side I have a very small carbon footprint.  Also I like cats.",
