The best way to learn is to stumble and get back up. Posting something that may be wrong which you believe to be true and getting an answer that'll help you understand what you got wrong can only help you.\n\nTheres nothing wrong with being wrong, as long as you're willing to learn and/or understand why and/or what you think/got wrong. We've all been there and I - for one - would like to hear from more of you... And at least get a clue I'm not the only guy here who still gets somewhat confused every once in a while..?",
