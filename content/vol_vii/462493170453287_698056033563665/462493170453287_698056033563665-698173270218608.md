I have not posted before as i don't want to be wrong in what i post don't like to be wrong or persucuted for being so. My knowledge is getting better as i remove some shit. I read as much as i can between slaving and sleeping. I hope to continue on my journey out of the fog and into the light, and no i don't have any imaginary friends ?. Well i hope i survive to see a post or thread another day.",
