   "message": "The Poor Quatloos folks don't know what to make of the Admiral. The \"Crazy\" answer is the safe one, because they don't want people looking TOO close, yet have \"plausible deniability\" when it turns out I'm right... which is always.\n\nI know for a fact that at least ONE of them knows EXACTLY who I am; and has tried to \"bait\" me with the lie that we \"struggled to pay a mortgage\" knowing it was a blatant lie.\n\nThat's a debt I will collect later. Lying about me costs, and I am FREE in 2016. I can then start \"Aggressive Kinetic Debt Collection\" :D",
