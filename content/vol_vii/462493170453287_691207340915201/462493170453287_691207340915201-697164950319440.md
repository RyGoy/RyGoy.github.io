Is there a reason why you have them separate?\n\nHere are the stamps that you suggested in another thread:\nAccepted by: (in black)\nBank of Canada (in black)\nSee back for endorsement (in red)\nBill of Exchange Act (in black)\nAccount number 26X-XXX-XXX (in black)\nInscription number 1196604XXXXXX (in black)\nDate: ________ (in black)\nVOID (in red)",
