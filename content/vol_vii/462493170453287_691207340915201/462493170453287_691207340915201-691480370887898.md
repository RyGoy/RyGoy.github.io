   "message": "Wow $28 is an excellent price for 3 stamps. I will need to order a separate one for me and my wife. I recall reading Pete mention that he has 7 stamps (including VOID which is rarely used). The last line is new information for me. Does what follows after BILLS OF EXCHANGE reference a particluar section of the ACT or just the actual name of the ACT e.g. BILLS OF EXCHANGE, BILLS OF EXCHANGE ACT?",
