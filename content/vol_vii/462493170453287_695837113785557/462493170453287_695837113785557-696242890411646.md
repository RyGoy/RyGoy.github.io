   "message": "Ummm:  Questions to ask based on the below quote:\n\n'When I got to Brandon the notary asked me to meet at his office to discuss Dean�s case. He informed me that the Law Society had sent out letters regarding �sovereign citizens� and how they are a nuisance and taking up unnecessary court time. '\n\nBesides an oxymoron, what is a sovereign citizen?\n\nIs that similar to the oxymoron 'courts of justice'?\n\nHow does one become an oxymoron such as a 'sovereign citizen'?\n\nWho deemed/profiled Dean to be this oxymoron?\n\nAs there are no synonyms and/or homonyms in law, I'm absolutely certain that oxymorons would most definitely be a nuisance that would take up court time unnecessarily :P",
