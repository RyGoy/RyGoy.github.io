   "message": "These \"Feel Good\" types are people who mean you harm by even existing. The feed the programming you already have and mean you harm by their very nature.\n\nThis is the result of NO critical thinking abilities. Truth is lost with these people, and they protect their bullshit violently. It takes a special kind of stupid to embrace such a mindset.
