   "message": "I have sent a letter, yesterday to the health care services, telling them that all this is their fault, because since december 2013 I am trying to have a simple answer to a simple question, four times I have asked, and they just don't answer, so I can't fill that renewal thing, because I am waiting on them to give me an answer.....\n\nI copied the Minister of Health Care Service, Gaetan Barrette, and this morning, I received a letter from his attachï¿½ politique, saying that : Rest assure that we have red your concern with interest, and they have reached our PROFOUND consideration, and they will follow up on it :D\n\nFuck, I HAVE ONE SINGLE FUCKING QUESTION :-o",
