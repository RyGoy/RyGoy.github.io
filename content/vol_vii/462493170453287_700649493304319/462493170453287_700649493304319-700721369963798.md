   "message": "Focus on getting better the rest will come. My boy broke his arm, needed emergency surgery and hospital stay ambulance rides and follow up visits. I planned to be responsible for all expenses even though I had no I idea where I could get the money to pay it off. I stayed positive and know the universe will never give me more then I can handle. With that being said, a week later we got a letter in the mail, apparently from some company bc I hadn't been able to add my boy to my company insurence. They ended up waiving all bills. I paid out 500$ on a 40k+ bill. Trust and believe",
