   "message": "\"Do I put March the 6th on that renewal form, which is the person's birth date, or do I put feb. the 19th, which is MY birth date\" Capitain Pete\n\nOmg, I'm turning into a terminology Nazi! :o The PERSON is a VESSEL and has a birth date or DATE OF BIRTH. The man has a birthday. BIRTH DATE is the ADMIRALTY term akin to passPORTs, BIRTH certificates etc. Am I wrong?\n\nI can't help but laugh wondering if the Minister of Health Care Service would NOTICE the difference if asked \"Do I put March the 6th on that renewal form, which is the person's date of birth, or do I put feb. the 19th, which is MY birthday\"",
