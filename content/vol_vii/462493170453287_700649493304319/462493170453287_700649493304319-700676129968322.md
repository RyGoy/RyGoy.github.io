   "message": "Ok.....here is the story....\n\nDec. 2013: I receive a letter from the Health Care departement, asking  to renew the insurance health care card, and to renew the picture of my face on it. On this renewal form, there is a section where they ask DATE OF BIRTH.\n\nDec.2013: I send them a letter, asking to confirm to me in writing, which date of birth they want, mine which is feb. the 19th ? ....or the person I happen to have, which is March the 6th.\n\nThe reason I asked that question is because, it seems to me, that it's the PERSON who is insured, and not me the man.....I literally explained that to them, in writing......I also told them that I will NOT argue what they will put in WRITING, I am just going to do EXACTLY what they are telling me to do...",
