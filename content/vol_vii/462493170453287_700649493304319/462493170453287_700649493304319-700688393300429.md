   "message": "When my wife went in to a private clinic for an ultrasound she was asked for her health card. Being a little shit I asked if they had a fee schedule if I did not have a health card. \"Yes we do\" and they told me they charge the same fee that they charge to the province. This seems to me to suggest they could charge a different fee if they choose.",
