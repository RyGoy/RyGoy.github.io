   "message": "ONLY $50, 0000 for damage against your PERSON....you're  nice guy Pete. I would have started at $1,000,000. I would include a fee, say $1/minute that HQ remains in possession or refuses to return your property, these VALUABLE INSTRUMENTS, from the date service was disconnected. \n\nJust my thoughts but you want to get HQ's attention so HQ can't IGNORE the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR. I also discovered in some commercial lien research that a perfected lien can be sold at adiscount. In order for it to be marketable it needs a large value attached to it. \n\nThis may be a shit stain but why lowball your claim? I think my PERSON is worth much much more since the PERSON I have is necessary for my survival in this FUCKED UP system. What is your life worth?",
