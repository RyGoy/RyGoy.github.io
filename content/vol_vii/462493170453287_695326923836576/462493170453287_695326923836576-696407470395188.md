   "message": "Declaratory Judgment is an alleged way to gain recognition by the courts/government of your superior control/ownership of the PERSON and everything in/attached to it. \"If you can get this on, you're free, you're outta there man. Just put a certified copy of the judgment in your pocket and go to town.\" I'm skeptical a court would make such a judgment, though. From what I've seen they do not recognize a man separate from his PERSON.",
