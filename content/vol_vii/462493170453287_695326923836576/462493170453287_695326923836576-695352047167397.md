   "message": "From the SEC: on Qu�bec \n\n\"Jurisdiction and Enforceability\n \nWe will appoint the Delegate General of Qu�bec in New York, One Rockefeller Plaza, 26th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10020-2102, as our authorized agent upon whom process may be served in any action based on the Securities which may be instituted in any State or Federal court in The City of New York by the holder of any Security, and will expressly waive any immunity to service of process regarding any action to which the Delegate General of Qu�bec might otherwise be entitled. This appointment will be irrevocable until all amounts in respect of the Securities have been paid, except that, if for any reason the designated agent ceases to be able to act as the authorized agent or no longer has an address in The City of New York, we will appoint another person or persons in The City of New York as our authorized agent. We will expressly accept the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any State or Federal Court in the City of New York or any competent Court in Qu�bec in any action based upon the Securities instituted in any such Court and will irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any immunity from the jurisdiction of any such Court to which we might otherwise be entitled.\n \nWe may be sued in the courts of Qu�bec, and no applicable law requires the consent of any public official or authority for proceedings to be brought or judgment to be obtained against us arising out of or relating to obligations under the Securities.  In addition, no immunity from suit is available to us in any action in those courts, irrespective of whether a party to the action or the holder of Securities is or is not resident within Qu�bec or is or is not a citizen of Canada.\n \nAlthough any judgment obtained in an action brought in the courts of Qu�bec against us may not be enforced by execution, applicable statutes provide that whenever we are condemned by a judgment that has become definitive to pay a sum of money, the Ministre des Finances et de l��conomie, after having received a certified copy of the judgment, shall pay the amount due out of the money at his or her disposal for that purpose or, failing that, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Qu�bec.\n \nIn enforcing a foreign judgment in foreign currency, a Qu�bec court will convert into Canadian currency at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date the foreign judgment became enforceable at the place where it was rendered. There is no currency indemnity in the terms and conditions of the Securities to make an investor whole for any difference in the exchange rate between the date the foreign judgment became enforceable where it was made and the date of its enforcement by a Qu�bec court.\"",
