   "message": "David-Paul Sip Court is a legal tool, just like liens/PPSAs. If you get a judgment against a person or entity with no income or assets then yes, you might not get paid. Neither might you get paid if they have income or assets and you fail to apply to the court for a garnishment order or hire a sheriff to appraise, seize and auction their property. Whatever authority you 'cede' by using a court you cede the same by using liens/PPSAs, because it's the same jurisdiction.",
