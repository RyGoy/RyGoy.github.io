I can send them a friggin piece of used toilet paper, IF THEY KEEP IT , its agreed as accepted and settled. If i write 1000000 on it and sign, they keep it, its agreed its good for settlement. Retention is key here. Know how to hold your contract. its simple stop getting so god damn complicated and focusing on public laws and statues and this and that. If they keep it we got ourselves a binding agreement. Bills of exchange act can be good to keep them in line but just know, if it is kept its good as gold. who knows what benefit they got out of the used piece but i dont really care. If they send it back, they discharged the account to zero. Its a win win people !!!!!!!!\n\n:D ....",
