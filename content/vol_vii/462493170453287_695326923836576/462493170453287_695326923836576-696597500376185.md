   "message": "\"That's why CORPORATIONS should lien, not YOU\" Ahhhhh....now there's the key. For some reason the Admiral commenting on ONLY being the PLAINTIFF in court is coming to mind with this. \n\nWithout causing a shit stain, is it accurate to say that CORPORATE PERSONS have more POWER than INDIVIDUAL PERSONS?\n\nCourt is a legal tool, just like liens/PPSAs\". This gave me some good insight  John . In my experience with \"small claims\" 20+ years ago the expectation was that I would somehow have the information needed to garnish a PERSON's wages (you need a SIN for that).",
