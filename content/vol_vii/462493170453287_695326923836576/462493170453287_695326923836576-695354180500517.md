   "message": "Pete Daoust this section could be useful: \n\nAlthough any judgment obtained in an action brought in the courts of Qu�bec against us may not be enforced by execution, applicable statutes provide that whenever we are condemned by a judgment that has become definitive to pay a sum of money, the Ministre des Finances et de l��conomie, after having received a certified copy of the judgment, shall pay the amount due out of the money at his or her disposal for that purpose or, failing that, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Qu�bec.\n \nIn enforcing a foreign judgment in foreign currency, a Qu�bec court will convert into Canadian currency at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date the foreign judgment became enforceable at the place where it was rendered. There is no currency indemnity in the terms and conditions of the Securities to make an investor whole for any difference in the exchange rate between the date the foreign judgment became enforceable where it was made and the date of its enforcement by a Qu�bec court.",
