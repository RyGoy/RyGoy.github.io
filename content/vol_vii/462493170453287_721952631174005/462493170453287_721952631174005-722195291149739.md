   "message": "For those who don't know, Larken Rose and Marc Stevens are philosophically close - Larken wrote The Most Dangerous Supoerstition, Marc wrote Government: Indicted.  One particular difference, though, is that Marc has more court room experience and specifically seeks to help people deal with mala prohibita accusations.  marcstevens.net has a huge (and often very entertaining) collection of Calls of Shame and previous No State Project radio show recordings.",
