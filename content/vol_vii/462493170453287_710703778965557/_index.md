   "message": "I have questions about resignation. Since I don't want to hijack Chris's thread with them, I will ask on a fresh one.\nAs someone who does electrical work, I have gone through the system and acquired \"red seal\" licenses for that trade. In order to get those licenses, I had to show \"government ID\" in the form of a drivers license. So, these licenses have been issued to my person, and not to ME. \n\nIn order to resign, I would have to send those back, correct?\n\nIf I intend to operate in commerce through the use of a fresh person (corporation) that I control, how would I do that without those licenses?\n\nThe license does not change any of my abilities/knowledge/skills in the field of electrical work. The problem as I see it boils down to insurance. If the customer wants a job done, they call a guy to do it. He then gets a \"permit\" and does the work. The work then gets \"inspected\". If there is no \"permit\" the customer risks their insurance being void.\n\nIn order to get around this, the corporation could simply \"hire\" a person with a license to satisfy the customer's permit requirements. That would allow ME to practise electrical stuff. But, this seems cumbersome.\n\nDoes anyone have anything that they could comment on this? \nAm I not thinking of the right questions? If so, please comment...",
