   "message": "Lee, in the US, we have 3 different forms of birth records.  \n\n1)  Hospital form with baby footprints (I forget what this one is called).\n\n2)  The long form is issued from the State of Birth and it's call a \"CERTIFICATE OF LIVE BIRTH\".  This one can be ordered from the State in certified form.  \n\n3)  The short form is issued by the State of Birth and can be printed out at the local county health department.  It is called, \"CERTIFICATION OF BIRTH\".  It has the NAME, SEX, DATE OF BIRTH, CERTIFICATE NUMBER, COUNTY OF BIRTH, FILE DATE.  It is a shortened version of the long form.\n\nAlso, these may vary slightly from State to State.  This is an example of the ones issued for my PERSON.",
