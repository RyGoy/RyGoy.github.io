   "message": "What is the story with being born around or before 1960(ish) and having a long birth record. I do not know if it states on the Long Birth Record: Birth Certificate.\nIf it does not state Birth Certificate on the Long Birth Record, would that mean you can not use the Long Birth Record as CONSIDERATION?
