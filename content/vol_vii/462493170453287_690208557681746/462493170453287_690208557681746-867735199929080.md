   "message": "There is something mildly suspicious about this document.  The word choices, sentence structure and presentation, make it difficult to believe it was written by a member of the judiciary.  Without further verification it falls into the \"close but no cigar\" category for me.  I suspect there are circumstances where following the advice verbatim could result in an extended unpaid \"vacation\".",
