   "message": "I had a similar experience. In the end the guy chucked what he fraudulently tried to pass off as a court document on the floor just inside my lobby. I took the document to the police and asked them to return it to him with a warning of trespass the next time he ever came to my door . The cop agreed the document was not from a court and agreed to return it to the twat with my warning. That was several years ago and he never came back :-)",
