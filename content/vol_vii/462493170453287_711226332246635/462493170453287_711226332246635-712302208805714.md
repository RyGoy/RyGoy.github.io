   "message": "The one question this young fellow asks is damn good \"What facts do you have that support your Legal conclusions or opinions? This one simple question has the traffic case prosecutor and the Asst. KY AG madder than hell. The second thing he does is his use of the Statutes-At-Large as positive law, when the code comes into conflict with the Statutes-At-Large, the Statutes-At-Large are controlling law, the intent of the Congress. \n\nHis suggestion of giving Judicial Notice first, then making them abide...then going back to the Statutes-At-Large was a good idea.\n\nThis kid gets the banking problem, not quite \"Money as Debt\" but darn close.",
