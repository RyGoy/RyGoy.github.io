   "message": "This is a fun one - SO i had a friend administer my 2011 tax return a few years back in Holland. The tax return paid out 10.x. in my favor since one box for \"double tax\" was clicked in the online application (having paid tax in Holland and in my home country) The calculation was made by the software, online for this amount and was stated that this is what i would receive. \n\nThe person received this amount in bank account. The person used this money to survive for a year without work. Since, returned account to state of zero!\n\nThe Tax office somehow thinks there was some kind of \"MISTAKE\" and sent a letter 2014 - Te Betal (To Pay) 10,500 Euros - Asking for said  'tax-back-mistake' money back.\n\nHow to administer such a request ?\ngiven that:\n1. Person is Expat living in Holland - without dutch skills\n2. Person is broke, without assistance from government\n\nI've been told to Administer that shit ... \nI expect to: \n1. Notice of mistake \n2. Bill for goods and services\n3. ask if surety covers the debt\n\nis this correct? \nDo i need to have a registered company to administer the person?",
