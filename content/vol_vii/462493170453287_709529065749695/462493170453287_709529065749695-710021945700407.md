   "message": "I just got billed 50 extra euro for failing to respond to another public debt ... this time it's only 254 euro for compulsory health insurance that can't be paid from a zero bank account ...  which is trying to be collecting by the debt collectors. The only reason why i waited is because i need a translation into dutch language. \n\nToday at the free legal advice office i confused two lovely people with - sole authorized administrator ... and surety. \n\nI still don't have a translation for \"surety\" and those guys were confused but they listened very carefully as i explained that i was not that person!",
