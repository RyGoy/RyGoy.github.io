   "message": "Aug 24th, 2014 NOTICE OF UNDERSTANDING � NOTICE OF INTENT � NOTICE OF LIABILITY\nRE: Events that occurred by creating File # 14-149711\nOPENING PREMISE: [on Police unaccountability] This raising of Tim Felger case by the SCC [at face value] seems to be offering us a ways and means to get to the SCC on Short Leave. AND at face value, VPD are probably relying on Tim Felger's case law, as the reason why they can abuse our rights.\n4. The big difference in our EDA case is that: Our Party is running lots of candidates for City office this fall and we are definitely fielding candidates in lots of ridings in the next General Federal Election.\n1. Our contention is that if they get away with criminalizing our IC75-2R8 /10 protocol, then they will definitely drive the final spike in destroying Democracy itself, and our marketing plans for opening lots of cannabis coffee shops in Vancouver, as one of our other campaign strategies to get elected.\n2. AT FACE VALUE: The fastest way to achieve our need to basically get a Tax ruling is by 1st filing a Motion with the BCSC on this new file #, and seek an injunction to carry-on until we file as '3rd party interveners in the Tim Felger Hearing, because Tim actually wants us to intervene in this case.\n5. ON THIS: We are actually not surprised at the total refusal from anyone in City Hall and VPD to communicate because [at face value] they are somehow forbidden [under the founding principles of Sec 9 of the BC Police Act - for example] to recognize [let alone � respect or honour or stand-under] our declaration to hold a genuine right to form Private Clubs' that operate under our claim of right to hold real common law protection, because that means they can't tell us what to do, under common law\n1. Enabling the return of common law rights to any landed Canadian is the exactly what Harper is trying to destroy, and somehow we become a prey for defending that enough is enough \n6. There's no way around it: we can and are in this club that's called: �the Supremacy of Parliament'\n1. The VPD can whine all they want BUT they must respect and protect our right to gain all kinds of voter participation with our IC75-2R8 loophole - especially during any City Election Campaign.\n2. Police simply are in direct violation of their fiduciary trust by obstructing us from getting our right to access the voters at any public event in any park [period]. This duty Sergeant knows that it's a criminal act to extort us into doing anything and frankly deserves to be criminally charged for extortion for threatening to confiscate our goods, when he is directly prohibited from doing that. \n3. NAMELY: Just like in Tim Felger's case, no Police Officer has a right to take anything from us because they are directly prohibited from robbing us of our guaranteed rights to express freely that we don't like what this City's uncivil servants are getting away with, especially when the reason behind what he's doing is basically, he doesn�t care what our rights are, [under Part 9 of the BC Election Act], all police MUST be empowered to do things that ordinary citizens cannot do. \n4. As we see it: this corrupt Sergeant is inviting himself to be the case law standard on how to deal with the extortioners that run the VDP goon squads that want Harper's perverted martial law society\n7. As we see it; Under the circumstances we really cannot expect our campaign to swing into full gear, until a BCSC or a SCC Justice recognizes our Constitutional guarantee to achieve thru lawful means, a ways and means to fulfil the only reason our Party exists NAMELY: to legalize marijuana thru Peaceful political means, and let's face it - in politics - timing is very important.\n1. [in our case] our political guarantee of our Freedom of Expression during an election season is clearly being violated by lots of City Officials, who are shocked by our campaign plans\n2. [in our case] the thin blue-line that they insist on crossing is inexcusable because their oath demands that they must protect our right to shake things up at City Hall, which includes all kinds of changes at VPD, because the principles of a Free and Democratic society are Sacred. \nON CONCLUDING THIS NOTICE: \n3. This Notice is being filed with Vancouver Elections and a plethora of high ranking Officials \n1. We are seeking a face to face meeting with Officers with Police Professional Standards\n2. In the event that we cannot get satisfaction by noon on going back to the PNE that evening, will result where we are filing in the afternoon for a ruling and injunctions on this open file.\n4. We accept that VPD just might have unwittingly have set us up AND they just might also want an injunction in order to know what they can or cannot do, because at face value they need to address the fact that whenever they obstruct what we are doing, simply makes things worse.\n1. If not now � then when? If not here � then where? We're not shrinking from their evil intent.",
