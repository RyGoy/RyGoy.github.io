   "message": "Notice from Marc Boyer\n\nI must be doing something effective because YouTube has blocked me from uploading my last video and now scribd(.com) just blocked me from uploading my last legal notice. So i'll try posting this 2-page NOTICE on my wall\nWHAT DOES COMMON LAW PROTECTION MEAN? IN OUR CASE IT MEANS THIS.\n1. Under the Elections Act, we can hold any authority [Police or Justice] to protect our marijuana beliefs, During an election campaign, all authorities are actually duty bound to protect our right to do things and promote things that the majority in power don't want to happen. In fact, they are directly prohibited from obstructing our campaign. No one with a badge can say that: Since they really don't want these reforms to happen, means they can obstruct our positive law initiative from attracting voters. \n2. Under Sec 1 of the Charter, it's reasonable to expect that the Marijuana Party can insist that the BCSC(British Columbia Supreme Court) and or the SCC(Supreme Court of Canada) must protect our right to legalize marijuana thru any means that we can conjure up.\n3. Our strategy has been transparent, and it appears to be working: We just act like we have the right to be Free [which we do] until Police obstruct us from expressing our ways and means to attract voters.\n1. Strategically, [due to the fact that we expected and got a negative police response] means we acted when it was the best time [if not the only time] to press /implement our program of legalizing cannabis by restoring our common law rights, which is during this Election Season, \n2. AND on August 22nd, our strategy of Peacefully pushing the limits of police intolerance, worked \n3. IN SO DOING, we just won a huge little mini victory for our cause, by campaigning at the PNE(Pacific National Exhibition)\n2. Here's what went down: On Friday evening, we are set up at the entrance to the PNE with our campaign cart full of cookies and smoothies AND we started handing out 'Vote for Marc Boyer' pamphlets, and attracting people to contribute to our campaign by using IC75-2R8/10(Canadian Revenue Agency form for political fundraising) protocol to attract voters \n1. We immediately were confronted by a PNE attendant, who brought his boss over within the first 15 minutes of being there. He stated that he was responding to a complaint that we were selling pot cookies and smoothies. He actually liked our explanation that what we were doing actually looked like we were selling, but we were just collecting contributions under a clever Elections Act loophole. \n1. After a 5 minute conversation, he admitted that he had no authority to stop us and said good luck \n2. About an hour later, one Duty Sergeant and 3 VPD(Vancouver Police Department, British Columbia) Officers show up and tell us to leave, because we were trafficking in marijuana. From the get-go this Sergeant was not going to accept a 'no' from us, but we were able to convince him that the IC75-2R8 protocol could protect our right to sell cookies, \n3. BUT they insisted that it was a criminal act of trafficking to give smoothie samples away, and because Marc Boyer was doing this, meant i would be charged with trafficking and my goods confiscated \n1. [this is important] They told the 3 agents that came with me that they would not be charged because they never gave any samples away, and they would be free to go, if i was arrested.\n1. In law [if it wasn't Election Season] this Sergeant can only make an offer to go away, and he knew i wasn't intimidated by his, when i said: 'I just might have to take you up on that offer'\n2. I then made this counter offer: I'll leave Peacefully when you give me an 'incident report file # '\n3. In law, he had no choice but comply, so i was handed a file # 14-149711 and i said: �thank you, we know how important this # was� and that we would start filing against it the next day'.\n4. The next day � i called VPD and i was told that this file # gave me the right to have The Police Professional Standards investigate my claims, and if they don't act to our satisfaction this morning that we'd be seeking remedy in BCSC criminal court for resolution in the afternoon, \n1. in law, we can get a ruling on really short leave [as in the next morning] because the standard of a week later can't apply BECAUSE the PNE is over by the time we get a ruling.\n2. In law, short leave means 'right now' because later [in our case] is obstruction of Justice.\n2. In law, no Justice in the BCSC or the SCC can deny our EDA the right to use IC75-2R8 protocol to attract political participation AND they must rule on a huge 'mistake' this VPD Duty Sergeant did when he used the excuse of �I had it was trafficking to give 3/4-oz smoothie samples away''\n1. BUT the last time [on June 15th] at the Car Free Days event, the reason stated for confiscating and robbing us of $3000 of goods was the exact opposite. NAMELY: \n1. it was OK to give the smoothies and cookies away, BUT it was trafficking to sell the cookies \n2. This PNE event excuse is the exact opposite excuse used at Car free Days and that means a Justice must address that they can't dream up excuses, in order to obstruct us, when it's actually every Police officer's duty to protect our rights while electioneering on any issue that they don't approve of. In this case � No Justice can ignore this situation where the Police are literally saying 'i don't care if he has rights; It's a crime for Police to censor our right to Campaign against Harper's plans to trash our Constitution, during an Election.\n1. Constitutionally our defence is bulletproof, regrettably we are not.",
