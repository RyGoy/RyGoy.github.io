   "message": "A local contact in the \"industry\" emailed me this recommendation awhile back:\n\nHi Mike,\n\n     The only laptop I will ever continue to use or purchase in the future will be a Mac Book Pro with OSX 10.9 etc..etc...(Mavericks)\n\n     I prefer that if you choose to get one, it should have 8 gb or RAM standard and expandable to 16 GB if possible.\n\n     The hard drive is not as essential to be concerned with because you should always have an 3 TB external anyway.\n\n      If I have to choose how much hard drive space in the computer standard, I would like a 1TB internal preferably a solid state...\n\n      Your core processor should be an Intel I-5, I-7 or better.\n\n      Duo core at minimum and Quad core prefered and expandable as well.\n\n      The screen can be 13\" or I prefer 15\"... anything bigger is obnoxious in my opinion and should have a Retina display or better.",
