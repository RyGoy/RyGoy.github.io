   "message": "Think about a Mac compared with Tara's post here... it is SOLD to you by HEARSAY... Every question relates either to hearsay or truth. \n\nMac's USED to have this \"superior processing power\" for graphics/animations, etc. It was only because they had the SOFTWARE to do certain things. Nothing had anything to do with processing power.  When I finally had enough dough to purchase a Mac (can't even bother to remember what it was), the guts were all \"generic\" ibm: video cards, hard drives, memory... \n\nIt was stupid.",
