   "message": "TT4L tshirts thread.\n\nI need new tshirts. We all need tshirts.\nI hate to shop for clothes - cant recall the last time I actually PAID for a tshirt... \n\nShopping centers are full of zombie slaves whoring for the latest majority fad, working more to spend more to look more \"majority\" at work because they're too brainwashed to have an opinion and want to avoid being associated with the majority because... THE MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG (and that I've know for 17 years now, #1 thing I learned in college)\n\nAnyways : i'm a graphic artist. I have a good silkscreener friend. I've been thinking about getting tshirts made for a while, but qtys are an issue.\n\nWould you guys and girls jump in if we could produce tshirts, maybe 5 different prints, different colors, on high quality tshirts / tank tops (tbd)... Usually front and back one color incl. top quality fit/fabric is under 15$...\n\nThrow in ideas !",
