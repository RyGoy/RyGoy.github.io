   "message": "\"Why not just go away and shut the fuck up ??\" You know I was thinking about this last night too Captain Pete...very fucking strange :/ And SEEMINGLY out of nowhere. What IDIOT gives away their location when they know a sniper is waiting with his finger on the trigger? There is no making sense out of nonsense. The comment you made seems to explain this nicely. Makes me wonder who else is lurking in these 300+ members that needs relief from their SUFFERing. Happy hunting! :D",
