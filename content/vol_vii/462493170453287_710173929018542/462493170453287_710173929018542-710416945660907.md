   "message": "It's a shame this Piece-of-Shit-Christian cannot see how real, and FAST his \"prayer for relief\" was answered. Most likely the first time in his life where he actually prayed for something, and got it right away. \n\nAll your \"prayers\" will be heard, and answered at The Tender for Law! Having suicidal thoughts? Call the Suicide Hotline, and someone will help you finish the job. Everyone knows you are all cowards anyways.  :D",
