   "message": "I regretfully ask that the Admins remove me, or I will leave the Group. As an Honest Man, I'll not hide the fact that I believe that without God the creator, I the the Human would not be here. As much as I learn, and now begin to realize The legal side of things, The actual \"freedom \" I can have. I'd rather not be \"found\" or thought to be an agent or \"spy\" or law enforcement or any other enemy. Merely seeking The truth of my actual \"rights\" as a Human as well as being able to break free from the Name. Thnx.",
