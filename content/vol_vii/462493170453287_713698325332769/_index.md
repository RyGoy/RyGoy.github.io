   "message": "So I am planning to order a seal so that I can ADMINISTRATE for my lady and am wondering what information I use on the seal since she does not possess a Canadian Birth Certificate (being born in another country). I recall reading that the number on the Citizen-SHIPCard would be used in this case(can't find the thread however). Is this correct Admiral Scott? \n\nI also noticed that unlike the Birth Certificate (which has two signatures the back of this citizenship card only has one signature (which reads MINISTER) and that her signature is on the front. This lead me to ask \"Who exactly is surety?\" since it is clear that this card is evidence that a new person was created. Is this similar to the scenario with the Driver's Licence where the woman IS PRESUMED to be the person because of her photo and signature and does this make her SURETY? \n\nI recall the recall reading that the GOVERNMENT OF CANADA becomes surety when that PERSON is tranferred from the old jurisdiction. This seems like an opportunity to provide deeper insights for those who were born in a jurisdiction different from where they currently live especially when it comes to ADMINISTRATING such a PERSON.",
