   "message": "Interesting...one difference is that my lady and I were married in a CIVIL (must look up this word) ceremony then a year later we were married in a church. The document I have is a Certified Copy of the Marriage Licence so the same PERSON, acting as Dupty Registrar General, signature appears twice (first on original, and second on certified copy). There is a registration number, a certificate number, and a licence number.",
