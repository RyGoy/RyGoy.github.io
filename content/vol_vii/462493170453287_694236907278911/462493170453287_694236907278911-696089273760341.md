   "message": "Natural Person is a bijural term, such as Natural Person in my private capacity. OR  The Bank Act 15. (1) A bank has the capacity of a natural\nperson and, subject to this Act, the rights, powers\nand privileges of a natural person.\n\nSo Graeme Berke doesn't make much sense.  I can be a PRIVATE PERSON or a NATURAL PERSON IN MY PRIVATE CAPACITY, I don't think there's a difference there.  So how do legal entities, ie, the government, get recognized as PRIVATE PERSONS by the courts?",
