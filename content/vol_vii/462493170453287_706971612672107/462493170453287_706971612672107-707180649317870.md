   "message": "Any evidence that points to the bifurcation of the NAME as bifurcated from the living man must not be exposed in open court. That attacks the root of the perceived integrity of the court system itself, which those BAR members have sworn to protect at all costs. It ruins their ability to generate revenues, so the system will strive to avoid proving the remedy in the public arena. This would probably work best if served privately on the Clerk and serve the magistrate Judicial Notice and let them settle the matter honorably in private.",
