   "message": "Staying away from their meeting is the goal. After the parking ticket I was pulled over for an expired tag (could not renew because of the unpaid parking ticket). I return the NOTICE marked in red \"No Consent, No Contract\". This likely meant nothing now that I understand the whole driver's licence trap and surety. So a court date was requested by filling out a form as the representative, by SPECIAL APPEARANCE, crossing out the word defendant (which they also IGNORED and listed the PERSON as defendant anyway), and signing V.C. (Vi Coactus). No matter they still scheduled the PERSON as defendent for their business meeting, lol!",
