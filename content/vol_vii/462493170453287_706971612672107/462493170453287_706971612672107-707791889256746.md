No response, Second notice,\nNotice of Fault, 7 days, no response, Notice of Default, filed into the Public\nRecord�most of you remember the Drill.\n\nI gave Notice in the form of a Notice and Demand to the\npowers that be. All property Federal and State belonging to Cesar was so\nreturned to their agencies and departments. Driver�s license, plate ect. a photo-copy\nof my new license plate was sent, same as the above�.never a response.\n\nAs of late I have filed a resignation letter, resigning as\nthe Registered-Agent for service of process for that �name, instrument, entity\nect�, sent Registered-Mail, to the Kentucky Secretary of State, Vital Statics\nand the KY. AG.  \n\nBTW mates, did I mention I did it all by Registered-Mail,\nthe kicker is, I did it on 1 or 2 three cent stamps, not to sound like a braggart\nmates, leave that to Captain Scott, friend, pal and all around good egg�G.  \n\nIF, Jimmy Stewart in miracle on 34th street can use the �Post\nOffice� to get Santa off and save Christmas, why can�t I use the \"Post Office\" to\nget me the hell out of United States Jurisdiction? I am attaching Self Address\npostmarked three cent Registered-Mail to this location. The Group thoughts are most welcome.\n\nIn closing mates, give me a little time to read Scott�s �Must\nReads� and members posts to catch up with the doings of the group, ole dogs and\nnew tricks�don�t you know.\n\nChase",
