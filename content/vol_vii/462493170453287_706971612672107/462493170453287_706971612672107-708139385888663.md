   "message": "If we want something better for all of us then the fence sitters and Administrators  had better realize that extreme detachment is the only solution, killing fiats by exchange and creating value to be held in a private trust and Administrated by a 3rd party IS the only option. Thereafter, understanding the new systems BEING PUT IN PLACE will ensure the survival and value of the Trust. Scott needs bodies for specific actions, it is THESE ACTIONS that will forward our evolution and usher in an age of logic and reason.
