It is generally considered bad form to \"defame\" the primary contributor to a forum and you may be \"invited\" to correct or recant.  Interestingly your response will likewise influence readers' perception on the nature and veracity of YOUR character.  \n\nStating a fact does not make you a braggart any more than a graceful retraction of words ill-received, diminishes you in the eyes of the viewing public.\n\nChoosing your words carefully, and the forum in which you express them, is all about perception; or so I perceive.",
