   "message": "Shepard Smith : Congratulations, you have succeeded in ticking me off! This is NOT a position that you want to find yourself in...\n\nIn earlier comments, you stated this:\n\n\"...not to sound like a braggart mates, leave that to Captain Scott, friend, pal and all around good egg�G.\"\n\nLet us take a moment to delve a little deeper into that sentence, shall we?\n\n�\"Braggart, adjective:  a loud arrogant boaster.\" \n-Merriam-Webster\n\nHmm, that doesn't sound good! Shall we dig further?\n\n-\"Arrogant, adjective: exaggerating or disposed to exaggerate one's own worth or importance often by an overbearing manner <an arrogant official>.\" \n-Merriam-Webster\n\n-\"Arrogance, noun: an attitude of superiority manifested in an overbearing manner or in presumptuous claims or assumptions.\" -Merriam-Webster\n\nOut of those three options, I'd like to focus on this one: \"Arrogant, adjective: exaggerating or disposed to exaggerate one's own worth or importance\".\n\nThis is how you describe the man that you then, in the same sentence, refer to as \"friend, pal and all around good egg\"? If you feel that Scott is \"exaggerating  his own worth\", then why are you wasting your own�and the rest of the group's�time here? \n\nAssume that that last question was rhetorical, as I already possess the answer. You are here for the same reason every other NON-infiltrating member is: because you recognize that there is VALUE. You are here because of your recognition that Scott's knowledge, intellect and abilities PROVIDE that value. \n\nSo, here is a question that I must insist that you answer: Why is that other people's awareness and acknowledgment of Scott's knowledge and insight is a sign of their intelligence and good judgement, yet his own awareness of who he is, and what he is capable of, is labelled \"arrogance\", \"ego\", and \"conceit\"?\n\nThis is not the first time that I have witnessed this rather slimy behavior from you. You are quite adept at disguising incredibly offensive comments under a steaming pile of \"Good Ol' Boy charm\". This demonstrates a tremendous lack of character, and reveals you to be a disingenuous man. \n\nMight I suggest some personal reflection; examine the close relationships that you have formed, decide which you truly VALUE, and why, and start VALUING them more! Actions speak louder than words, and your words are so smothered in spurious charm that they are barely audible.\n\nYou are either someone's friend, or you are not. You are either WITH them, or AGAINST them. Until you demonstrate ANY evidence that you actually ARE Scott's friend, I have just one thing to say: Fuck your easy-going, laid-back, Southern-thing!",
