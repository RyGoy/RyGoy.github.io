   "message": "I was THINKING a lot, these past 2 to 3 weeks, and I KNOW everything I need to KNOW, to use a PERSON I trust, to lien PIERRE DAOUST, and keep it in a private trust, and let the person I have full trust in, administrate the shit out of PIERRE DAOUST, and live my life....\n\nBut there is something inside of me that prevents me of pressing the send button, I really feel I have NOT pushed as hard as I could to make these FUCKING PUBLIC trustees to do their FUCKING job....\n\nI hate it when this happen, I fucking feel like I haven't done EVERYTHING that needs to be done, I really hate that shit.....is it fucking BELIEFS that still sit in me ? ....or is it REALITY that tells me, HEY PETE, you can do more.....\n\nYou see the dilemma ??  :D",
