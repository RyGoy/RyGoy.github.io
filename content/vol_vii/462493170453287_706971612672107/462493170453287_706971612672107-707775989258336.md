   "message": "I have asked for a proper bill from these TRUSTEES in parking ENFORCEMENT and all the do is IGNORE it. They say PAY and we can give you a receipt but can't give you a BILL. I point out that their notice meets all the requirements of a Bill of Exchange and ask them to provide the Bill. They just IGNORE my registered letters and tell me the only option is to request a court date. I refused, they IGNORED and voila the result is a \"conviction\". I think it is also called a default judgment.",
