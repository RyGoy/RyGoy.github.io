   "message": "Thanks for the CORRECTION Admiral. I fucking know this too. :(  I think the fact that it is a FOUNDATION document is why I've heard it is not not be used as ID. Excuse that avoidable shit stain.\n\nI know that Capitain Pete. I resisted providing the Driver's Licence. I even advised the officer (and recorded it) that the driver was not operating in the capacity presumed by the driver's licence, is not a government agent or employee and did not wish to contract today BEFORE providing the licence. His reply: \"I don't care what capacity you are operating under\".  Another officer showed up and tried to force her way into the car.  Then of course began to force compliance with  threats of taking my property, kidnapping my little boy, and even arresting me when I would not return to my car.",
