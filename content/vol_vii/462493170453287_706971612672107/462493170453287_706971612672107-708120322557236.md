   "message": "This supposed elite is super powerful, but is afflicted with weak strength, in fact they are few and must rely on accomplices from the people. Some are aware as they enjoy enormous privileges, as bankers, military leaders, politicians, top officials religious leaders, bosses of multinational etc. Other accomplices are unconscious, it is the mass of people who choose to believe lies rather than reassuring Truths, who refuse to challenge their limiting beliefs and further propagate preferring to remain in the comfort of nickname ignorance. So we are all responsible for this state of affairs, the minority of rulers and the majority accepts that consciously or not to be dominated.",
