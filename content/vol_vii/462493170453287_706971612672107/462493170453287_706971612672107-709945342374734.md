I have some paperwork for the court, Bailiff, would you hand these to Ms. Burk? The Bailiff gave the Judge the paperwork, and she started to read it, her body language changed, I had hit a cord or something�.Scott has a point, sometimes things work, right or wrong�not saying I did this right, just saying the way Ms. Burke looked showed something had happened�long story short, she stated she wanted to look over the paperwork and set a hearing for October�I asked her if I needed to be there since the release was filed with the court, she respond Yes Sir, I would like you to be here.\n\nI know you good folks don�t like these �Persons� and with\ngood and just reasons, there is an old saying, that appears to work for me,\nKeep your friends close, keep your enemies closer.\n\nGood or Bad, right or wrong, we�ll find out come October,\nuntil then, I am way pass due on reading group posts and Scott's must reads�IF this bugger goes South, then its my own fault and responsibly, which I accept�If it goes the other way, then I got lucky, either way I�ll keep the group posted on the outcome.\n\nBTW, as to the statement, Christ is my witness, has no\nbearing on this man�s beliefs, however it does have meaning before the court, besides I believe were all on/in a Holodeck�G.\n\nUntil next time, best wishes to us all.\n\nChase",
