   "message": "The mafia lost the \"organised crime\" war. Technology beat them. They are just dealing in scraps now. As a Noble, I ACTED as a \"Good Citizen\". I paid my bills, and all my taxes... AND I DIDN'T GET WHAT I PAID FOR.\n\n...so I resigned from government service and am building my \"criminal\" empire.\n\nIf their signature appeared on a document with my name on it, I intend to have them grievously maimed and I intend to take their stuff...and give it away to strangers.\n\n...I'll be sitting in jail when that happens.
