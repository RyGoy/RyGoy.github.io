I think the ORIGINAL Silk Road had been open for a week, before I went shopping.\n\nThe Silk Road YOU are used to, is the SECOND one... It hot hacked and 80,000 BTC was stolen from user's accounts.\n\n...they paid it back to each and every user out of their own pockets! I LOVE that the people I broker assassins with, are ethical, and have a conscience. :D",
