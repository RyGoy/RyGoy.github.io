   "message": "Hmmmm, This:\n\n'Scott Duncan That is an upcoming article: THE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF PERSONS.\n\nTHE PERSON on ONE ticket, is NOT the PERSON on the other. They are SEPARATE PERSONS, but the SAME surety.'\n\nSeems to tie in quite well with this:\n\n'The Doctor: He's me. There's only me here, that's the point. Now let's get back. \nClara: But I never saw that one. I saw all of you. Eleven faces. All of them you. \nThe Doctor: I said he was me. I never said he was the Doctor.\nClara: But I don't understand.\nThe Doctor: My name, my real name, that is not the point. The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it's like, it's like a promise you make. He's the one who broke the promise. {Clara collapses} Clara? Clara! He is my secret.\nThe Old Man: What I did, I did without choice. \nThe Doctor: I know.\nThe Old Man: In the name of peace and sanity. \nThe Doctor: But not in the name of the Doctor.'\n\nThere are a few/several holes in my comprehension that are preventing me from tying these bits of information together...I am eagerly awaiting the article :)",
