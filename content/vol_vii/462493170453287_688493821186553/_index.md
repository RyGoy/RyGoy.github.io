   "message": "Remember the day Dean was Arrested?\nLou Manotti went off to the seminar (NO he DIDN'T PAY!) to chat with Dean Clifford, but ended up making sure Norah Holloway didn't get swept up in the mayhem...\n\n...he's really heroic when it comes to women, but the guy will totally bail the helm, when we are careening toward a million-dollar yacht. (Save us Admiral!) :D \n\nAnyway I announced the seminar a THE PLACE TO GO if you wanted to avoid me. Aquilae had 2 OFFICERS there that you DON'T know too, so even though I wasn't there... I was there.\n\nBut THE NAME OF THE DOCTOR was playing that day, so I thought to myself, \"Fuck their rights and personal liberties! They'll still be stupid after, and I know what's important\"!\n\nSo, now that the \"shock\" has died down, you might want to experience that day from my perspective :D\n\nHere is THE NAME OF THE DOCTOR. Watch it before the thing gets pulled :D\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByAyYx2cx8NDXzYtb2FrVU1mS00/edit\n\nThe \"end\" that gave me the \"feels\", for the TL;DR crowd:\n\nClara: Who's that?\nThe Doctor: Never mind. Let's get back.\nClara: Who is he?\nThe Doctor: He's me. There's only me here, that's the point. Now let's get back. \nClara: But I never saw that one. I saw all of you. Eleven faces. All of them you. \nThe Doctor: I said he was me. I never said he was the Doctor.\nClara: But I don't understand.\nThe Doctor: My name, my real name, that is not the point. The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it's like, it's like a promise you make. He's the one who broke the promise. {Clara collapses} Clara? Clara! He is my secret.\nThe Old Man: What I did, I did without choice. \nThe Doctor: I know.\nThe Old Man: In the name of peace and sanity. \nThe Doctor: But not in the name of the Doctor.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByAyYx2cx8NDXzYtb2FrVU1mS00/edit",
