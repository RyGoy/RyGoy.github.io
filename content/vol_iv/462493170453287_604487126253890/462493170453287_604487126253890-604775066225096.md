   "message": "Since the government is a trust. It is administrated by the corporation of the govt IE: Govt of Canada corp.  The Value of you is determined by you.  They assessed us based on a lifetime of labor.  Only we are not privy to that info.  There is no one to stand and rebut for the govt. No person, it is a trust administered by corporate officers thru charter.\nSo do an appraisal of skill set and what would be market value for accounting or administering the person since birth about 70 years including retirement.\nIt is your value what is it worth to you?",
