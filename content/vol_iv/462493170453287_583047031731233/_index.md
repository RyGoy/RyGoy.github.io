   "message": "Heading to the Million Mask March tomoz guys, might have a bit of an issue with the whole Assembly topic. here is a copy from the state of Victoria, Australia law hand book: UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY\n\nIn Victoria unlawful assembly is not defined in an Act of Parliament but is a common law offence prohibiting an assembly of three or more people with an intent to commit a crime by open force, or with intent to carry out any common purpose, whether lawful or not, in such a manner as to give reasonable people in the vicinity reasonable grounds to fear a breach of the peace.\n\nAlso, under section 10 of the Unlawful Assemblies and Processions Act 1958 (Vic), any person who attends and takes part in an unlawful assembly, as defined by the Act, which includes any political demonstration, is guilty of an offence. This charge is very rarely used, but it does illustrate the power that governments have to stop \"political\" actions if they wish to do so.  I'll keep you all posted on what happens, we all have video recorders etc, My belief is that if our \"tax\" dollars pay for it and it's public property then we can basically do what we like, the police cannot tell us where to go otherwise that is contracting with them..",
