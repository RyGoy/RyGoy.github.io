   "message": "The Post Office and Judicial Courts were established before the seat of the Government.\nOn Thursday, Sept.  17, 1789 we find written, Mr. Goodhue, for the committee \nappointed for the purpose, presented a bill to amend part of the Tonnage act, which\nwas read the first time.  The bill sent from the Senate, for the temporary establishment\nof the Post Office, was read the second and third time, and passed.    The bill \nfor establishing the Judicial Courts  . . . , for establishing the seat of government\nOther references to the Post Office support my theory of the founding\nforefather�s views:\nPOST OFFICE. A place where letters are received to be sent to the persons to whom\nthey are addressed. \n2. The post office establishment of the United States, is of the greatest importance\nto the people and to the government. The constitution of the United States has invested\ncongress with power to establish post offices and post roads. Art. 1, s. 8, n. 7.\n3. By virtue of this constitutional authority, congress passed several laws anterior\nto the third day of March 1825, when an act, entitled \"An act to reduce into\none the several acts establishing and regulating the post office department,\"\nwas passed. 3 Story, U. S. 1825. It is thereby enacted, 1. That there be established,\nthe seat of the government of the United States, a general post office, under the\ndirection of a postmaster general.  [259]\n We need to take notice where the commas are placed on that last sentence.  That\nthere be established, the seat of the government of the United States, a general\npost office, under the direction of a postmaster general. When I set off a clause\nwith commas, I make sure that the sentence makes sense without that clause.  Taking\nout the set-off clause, we read, . . . the seat of the government of the United\nStates under the direction of a postmaster general.\n The creation of the Post office occurs before the creation of the seat of the government, and is placed in authority over the seat of government.  What is the effect of these\nlegal techniques?  The stated position of an object and the sequence of events play an important role in the Universal Legal Technology.  The effect is that the Government�s later bankruptcies in 1859 and 1929 have no legal effect upon the solvent Post Office.\nWe can make a case that the formation of the Post Office before the formation of\nthe government�s operations is a stroke of dumb luck.  Perhaps it is ingenious,\nsince communication has a higher value than government itself.  If any government\nfails, the people still have a need to communicate with one another to form a new\ngovernment. And to this day, the Post Office is still solvent and operational, ready\nto fulfill its duty to help the people in their communications; to set a new government\nshould a complete break down of the existing governmental structures occur in the\nUnited States.  Sounds like a very good back up plan. \n The formation of the Universal Postal Union in 1874 has another legal effect that\nis very important to the Universal-Legal-Technology.  The Universal Postal Union\nunites member countries into a single, worldwide postal territory.  We have\nalready learned that any litigant is going into international jurisdiction every\ntime he goes to any court.  Since the litigant needs to establish that his papers\nare official, he uses a dollar postage stamp on the face of the first page.  The\nstamps also invoke postal statutes and the Universal Postal Union jurisdiction. \nCurrently in the U. S., the stamp of choice is the fox U. S. dollar postage\nstamp.  The stamp is not drawn in a box, making the forty-five-degree lines unnecessary.\nThe litigant does, however, need to autograph across the stamp, then date the autograph,\nfor two reasons: to comply with postal regulations concerning private mail carriers,\nand to make a continuance of evidence that the process (paper work) is mail.  The\ncontinuation of evidence is less of a factor, since the definitions of mail\nand delivery can include a clerk at a grocery store handing a customer a receipt\nfor groceries.  \n( Heres's my question!!!! Are we/I missing something, as far as the SEAT of Gov,as mentioned?? Help me understand this, Can the PO, be used as a court??) Read the Part about where the comma's are placed!",
