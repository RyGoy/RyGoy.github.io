   "message": "This question is for Scott Duncan, yet if any feel you can better contribute than Scott (good luck with that), and/or you are certain of the answer, please feel free to comment ... at your own peril, of course. \n \nBack in May, in a civil matter for debt collection from a local bank, for a small amount ($3,000.00USD), a municipal court send a NOTICE OF HEARING for August.  \n \nThey all received back a NoM, voided orders, new originals, with the BC/SURETY BOND attached, meaning the \"DEFENDANT/DEMANDADO) is already in the custody, via registered mail, plus it was filed in the court file as well. \n\nShorter version of the story, The trial  was \"held\" last October 9th, and the sentence was \"WITH PLACE, WITH TRIAL IN THEIR MERITS, Fund. 43\" \"Status\"; RESOLVED, INACTIVE SINCE 09302013 \"  Now, \"Fund. 43\", what the heck is that? \n\nThe PERSON never received notices  after NOTICING the MISTAKE, but their website say they did.\n\nDoes that means they settled the accounting and closed it, as per the NoM, or does that mean the PERSON better cough-up the \"money\" quickly because they railroaded HIM? It's seems they still PROCEEDED. \n\nIt's hard to tell, because I don't have any documents from the court. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
