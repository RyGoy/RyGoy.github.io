   "message": "That is EXACTLY what I had concurred. It is not MY NAME, is in THEIR custody, I AM not SURETY of HIM and I splashed evidence all over them, is not my place, is NOT OF MY FUCKING BUSINESS what do after that. \n\nBut I wanted to bring this question up, because as part of our \"programming\" WE LOVE TO BE ATTACHED to that fucking NAME! And I have found myself sometimes, and seen some friends here at TTLF, still lingering  for some kind of magical \"approval\" from our rapist, after correcting a MISTAKE.\n\nPerhaps not the best analogy but, I think of it as this: \n\nOne receives a letter in ones mailbox, for our next door neighbor (which happen to be a government employee), Oops! Thats a MISTAKE, thats not intended for ME. So I kindly RETURN that offer to open someone elses CORRESPONDENCE, and and give it back to the REAL party with surety, for its not for ME. \n\nNow, would it not be DELUSIONAL to, after returning a correspondence that is not for YOU, still wander, and wander about what the fuck that letter said/was for? :D \n\nThanks for answering my question Scott! I'm sure a couple of smart ones will appreciate what you just clarified.",
