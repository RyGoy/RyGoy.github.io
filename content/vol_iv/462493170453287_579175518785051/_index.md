   "message": "\"... is forfeit to Her Majesty the Queen in right of the province of BC... ...The Civil Forfeiture Act\"\n\nThe owner of a house repeatedly visited by the police in recent years has been ordered to pay $200,000 to the provincial government.\n\nThe civil forfeiture judgment means that, not only will the owner have to pay, but if there is any illegal activity there in the next five years, the government can simply take the house in the 7300 block of 208th Street.\n\nRobin Joseph Krayem, one of the owners of the property, has been convicted of unauthorized possession of a firearm and of possession of instruments for forging or falsifying credit cards, said Langley RCMP Cpl.

Murray Power, operations support officer for the\n\nLangley Mounties. \"Residences such as this one become a significant drain on police resources and often a daily nuisance for those living in close proximity.\" The property has in fact been a magnet for police since at least 2009.\nCont....\n\n",
