   "message": "It sounded as though he did not put up much of a fight. He apparently had not responded to the court documents. I guess 200k doesn't mean that much to him.\n\nI have never heard of this ACT before this. If \"ignorance of the law excuses no one\" and even people who have dedicated their lives to law cant know it all, then how is a layman supposed to know, especially while being dumbed down with disinformation from day one?\n\nThey require us to be more informed then they themselves are.\n\nAnyways, this makes me sick.",
