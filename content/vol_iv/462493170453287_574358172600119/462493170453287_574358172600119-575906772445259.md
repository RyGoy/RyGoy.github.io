   "message": "Lets see what happens to shooter Forcillo, he clearly had the intent to murder Sammy Yatim. His supervisor who for shits and giggles come along after the fact and tazer'd the kids dead body has not been charged with anything. This fact leads me believe there won't be much if any consequence. The police services, as most us in the know, know they have nothing but contempt for civil society. They are trained to be deceptive and violent to peaceful individuals who choose to not do business with those doing business as Police Services.",
