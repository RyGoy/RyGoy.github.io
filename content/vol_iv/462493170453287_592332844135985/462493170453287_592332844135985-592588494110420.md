   "message": "I wont tell you the name...i travelled over the m50 a few times. i missed a few notices. i rang to ask why a motorway has a dual carrageway speed limit. and where were the non government signs that non government companys must use. i was told to speak to a judge. \n\nthe company NTR will take payment from me as the user of a car but they wont listen to a problem from anyone but the reg. owner. \n\nSo if the car happens to be crashed into the power supply/meter on the m50. is that the reg. owners fault?\n\nif a car is driven over a child is that the reg. owners fault?",
