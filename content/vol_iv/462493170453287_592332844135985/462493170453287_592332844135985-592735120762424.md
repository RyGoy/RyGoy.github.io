   "message": "ALERT: Derek Moran has been FREED.\n\nHeld all day WITH his consent, while receiving intermittent verbal-lashings of being told he THINKS wrong while being fed cake-coffee-water-and-pizza by his captors while Derek willingly suffered from The Stockholm Syndrome and an over-exposure to LENS FLARES, the night ended without incident, as now under The Spell of the AQUILAE-PROGRAMMING, escorted-and-accompanied THE CAPTAIN onto Dry-Land and into downtown Toronto, whereupon there, his ORDEAL finally came to a conclusion. That being said- he looks forward to the next time being beaten by 'Billy-Club' Butler.\n\nOh...and the Birth Certificate, is a BOND, that announces one is able/eligible, to engage/conduct themselves in COMMERCE.",
