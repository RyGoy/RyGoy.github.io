   "message": "Oh...just remembered.  In the seminar, Dean Clifford definitely went into detail about beating up a cop.  He said he grabbed him, threw him off a couple cars, etc.  Then he said he got off on the charges.  I think he was talking about the Feb 2 incident.  I wonder if admitting that publicly was part of this problem?  Scott?",
