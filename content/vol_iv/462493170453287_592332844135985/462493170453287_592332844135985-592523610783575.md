   "message": "Mo Chara Do Chara. Charles Allen owner of Rodolphus private family trust fund. Himself and Ben Gilroy(DDI) had bench warrents issued against them for contempt. They have been a holding company for people in arrers on their mortgauge. They have been telling the sheriff that he comes from old english time but since 1922 Eire has its own constatution and their is no mention of a sheriff in it. The cases are proceeding in court weather the summoned party are present or not.....\n\nIrish law is fucked up...I went to court and told a judge I was the person who might have broken the law and the name on the summons was an innocent party. I was then told it didnt concern me and that I could observe but stay quite... I was almost done for contempt when I continued to question the judge on the evidence that was in front of him. I am not a freeman or any of that but a judge should judge facts and not just carry on by inforcing deffered payment while acting with undue influance for a non-government, privately owned company..",
