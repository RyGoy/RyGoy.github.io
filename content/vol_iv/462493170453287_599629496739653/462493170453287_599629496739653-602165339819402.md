   "message": "**blinking furiously**\n\nBy way of TRUST, and my own DETERMINATIONS, I know the following to be true:\n\n1. Scott Duncan is always right.\n2. Scott is happy to share the fact that he has an exceptionally large penis and women who wish to view/get slapped in the face with said penis, get extra points, if they visit him in a �Naughty Schoolgirl� outfit. \n3. The preverbal shit is about to hit the fan in a way that perhaps none of us can imagine. \n4. Drones and an array of the neatest gadgets are being readied, and, or, are already standing by. \n5. Ceit Butler makes the most amazing pancakes. \n6. Tara Duncan is the coolest chick, and, she has arguably elevated this page into the realm of a compelling and fascinating novel, worthy of many accolades for generations to come.\n7. If you want to �know� why, the answer just may be: �Fuck Off! That�s WHY!�\n8. On Ghost/Baby/Zombie/Rapist day, some of us are certain to receive stupendous gift(s). \n9. The �Second Coming of the Admiral� TM will take place in the not too distant future. (Please do not take offence Scott, I am aware that: enlisted men come, and officers �arrive�, but the phrase works so well in the context of this page.)\n10. While ironically, he hates us all, a number of us have grown to love him for all that he has done for us!",
