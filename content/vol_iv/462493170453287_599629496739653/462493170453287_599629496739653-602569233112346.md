LOL!\n\nLou Manotti You are never jailed but rather WAREHOUSED. LOL!\n\nLou Manotti a THING can never be a MATE aboard THEIR SHIP, that is why THEY refer to you as an INMATE when you are warehoused aboard (the jail).\n\nLou Manotti THEY can only OFFER youthe PRIVILEDGE/BENEFIT of being recognized as being their PROPERTY/THING-so grow some balls and WAIVE it!!\n\nLou Manotti ANY court that fails to provide remedy due to a mistake is operating under FRAUD! therefore for and on the RECORD the ORDERS/ACTIONS/ENDORSEMENTS of the court are of NO FORCE/EFFECT.",
