   "message": "GOOD QUESTION, Pierre. I suspect the SIGNED Bill of Lading, CONFIRMING that the GOODS/CARGO were in fact actually DELIVERED to our Tire Store, was PROOF (PROOF = SIGNATURE), that the CARRIER, had performed HIS obligation, barring any OBJECTIONS of course from us, thereby the CARRIER-driver RETURNING the Bill of Lading, to the SHIPPER/Michelin, would now constitute cause for Michelin to fulfill their OBLIGATION next which would be, to PAY THE CARRIER for performing HIS obligation",
