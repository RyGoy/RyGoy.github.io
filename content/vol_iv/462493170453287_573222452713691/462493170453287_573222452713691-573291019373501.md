   "message": "I submitted to the courts the same notification of a Title 18 violation, I haven't had any calls from the FBI.  However, a friend of mine who has issued several BoE's and a notice of a Title 18 violation with a traffic ticket did receive a call from the FBI.  They wanted a phone interview or to meet face to face with him.  He asked the agent to mail him a certified copy of his oath of office along with a copy of the questions that the agent wanted to ask. He told the agent once he received his oath and the questions, had a chance to look the documents over he then MIGHT be willing to speak with them.  The agent declined, and my friend hasn't heard from the FBI again.  It's been over a year.",
