   "message": "The pictures of the Berlin \"gates\". I never understood (as my father once pointed out), why do the horses face the people who couldn't enter if it is an \"entry\"? But everyone just takes pictures of it... with no realization of what it is/was. They were just there! YAY! And NOW... I don't even see that picture with that ENTRY as the same reality.",
