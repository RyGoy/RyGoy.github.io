   "message": "Sovereign \nA chief ruler with supreme power; one possessing sovereignty. (q. v.); \n2. In the United States the sovereignty resides in the body of the people. \nVide Rutherf. Inst. 282. \n--Bouvier's Law Revised\n6th Edition, 1856 \n\n\"[It is] the people, \nto whom all authority belongs.\"  \n--Thomas Jefferson to Spencer Roane, 1821.  \n\n\"There is no such thing as a power of inherent Sovereignty in the government of the United States. In this country sovereignty resides in the People, and Congress can exercise no power which they have not, by their Constitution entrusted to it: all else is withheld.\" --Julliard v. Greenman, 110 U.S. S. 421 \n\n A piece of paper does not give people the right to walk the earth as one of God's creatures. People have that right without the Constitution, without the Amendments some people call the \"Bill of Rights,\" and without a Birth Certificate. \n\n No Political or Royal figure can give one the right to be free or take that right away. The idea that one is \"given\" what one already has is an illusion created for the purposes of control, power, and manipulation. Such an idea exists only when people allow it to exist or are ignorant of their rights.",
