   "message": "you aren't asking me Chip, but I'd like to contribute (hopefully not a shit stain :/) the corp/trust idea as I try to comprehend the big picture, is the best solution because there is no honour left in the system. So the corp/trust provides us with an opportunity to manouever though the system with a protection that we don't have as long as our legal name is fair game to use in the public. I see alot of things/letters/tools that have resulted from the recent Apostolic letter ..which may be all good IF the club house players cared and followed their own laws. If given the choice to be protected by a corporation vs a letter , the better choice seems to be a corporation/trust that is created for the purpose of my and other beneficiaries welfare.
