   "message": "The-Person's Administration Thread :P\n\nI received a few PM recently concerning the person I have in my pocket is administration.\n\nAnd all of these questions directed to \"ME\" by some members in here were related to: BY WHAT AUTHORITY I DECIDE TO BE THE ADMINISTRATOR of the person I happen to have in my pocket. Like, who gives me the authority to do this :/\n\nIt's in my pocket for fuck sakes, and I have not stole it... :/\n\nLike if suddenly, I am doing something WRONG because I say I am the administrator of that person :D\n\nI see with this type of thinking, where Scott Duncan is leading us with his famous: You think wrong, and value the wrong thing :)\n\nWe have ALWAYS administrate that person, HELLOOSSS!!!! :D\n\nIt's not a new thing I am doing, I always been the Sole Authorized Administrator of that person, I was just a bad administrator, or worse, I had no clue that I had something in my pocket that needed to be administrate :P\n\nSo, here HOW I see this....\n\nI was born :P\n\nThe government created a person and put that thing in my pocket, no explanations, no signature from my part, no understanding from my part, I was 3 weeks old for christ sakes .....\n\nSo they've put it there, They've signed as surety, and made sure I don't get to learn all that shit.....they've taught me to get a good education, to have a good job, and to act as surety for that person. Very simple plan :D\n\nAnd today, I am aware of all that shit, so I will STILL be the Sole Authorized Administrator for that person, like I've always been, but will administrate a little, very slightly different :D\n\nUntil they decide to REMOVE that person from me :D\n\nThink about that, the government shows up at your place to take away the person, because they don't feel very good with the administration methods you use...even though ALL that you do is completely LEGAL.......HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!\n\nThat would be an AWESOME DAY for me, they would ADMIT by doing such a thing, that we are ALL slaves.....a get out of the closet type of thing :D\n\nAnd I don't have to advise them about a sudden intent of me wanting to administrate the person.....I just start administrating a new way, and let them know in the process, WHO I AM.....\n\nwho cares about what they will think, in fact, I am not even sure that they will think :(",
