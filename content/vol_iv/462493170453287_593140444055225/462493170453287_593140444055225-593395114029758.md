   "message": "As for your \"magic document\"....the Notice of Mistake is the closest you'll find, for IN court. But ONLY if you all start fucking using it properly! It's NOT just a document. \n\nIf at ANY time while you're speaking, you feel you've stepped into their jurisdiction by accepting SURETY, you throw out a VERBAL Notice of Mistake: \"If I have led this court to believe that I am a paryt with SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE. and please forgive me\".\n\n And responding to \"You\" is the biggest one. Let them know right from the start that as the Sole Beneficiary of the BIRTH CERTIFICATE BOND, you wish to solely be addressed as \"insert regular old first name here\". And ANYONE who doesn't address you by THAT NAME ONLY, EVERY time that they speak to you, you respond \"Are you addressing me? As the SOLE BENEFICIARY, I wish to solely be addressed as:___\"",
