   "message": "Then you work on your first document. Notice of Questions for the Court. \n\nAddress every question that you need answered in order to UNDERSTAND the NATURE and CAUSE of these PROCEEDINGS. Also include your Affidavit of Status with this document. \n\nHave everything nicely organized with tabs seperating each document, a cover and spiral-bound at your local copy place. \n\nIt's a LEGAL DOCUMENT...so make it fucking look like one. You don't want to be treated like a joke in court? Then don't give them ANY excuse to.\n\nInclude the Notice of Mistake in a tab marked EXHIBIT #1 in the back. It has already been submitted when you sent the DISCLOSURE back by REGISTERED MAIL (with NO return address!). Give them 10 days to respond,  have your documents NOTARIZED and mail it in.",
