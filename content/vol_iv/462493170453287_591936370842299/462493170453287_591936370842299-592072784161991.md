   "message": "So the free dumb thing is a trap...\nClaiming something created by them in their courts leads to them claiming what is theirs, the Name created at the time of the charge and the person it is derived from to which surety is attached, the rope guys were acting for the accountants. Through consent after a conviction. So by inference there was consent previously given in some way, shape or form for them to have the authority to grab him stemming from charges that surety was attached by consent?\nSo someone is lying and it is not the rope cops, cause they are doing a duty as set out in a contract.\nStayed charges were converted and guilt was established in absentia?   Or upon release he was given certain conditions ( parole)... \nbut this rope thing is based on a conviction?  \nConvicted of what? \nServing time for what?\nWhat are the specific lies?    \nah... it is none of my business, \nso the lesson....\nBuyer beware after all.",
