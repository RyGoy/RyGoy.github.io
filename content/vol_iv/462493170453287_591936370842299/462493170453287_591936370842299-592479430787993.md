   "message": "The circumstances of the arrest are important, but more for me is WITNESSING that it is BULLSHIT that we have \"RIGHTS\", \"natural law\", and that all this peace and love bullshit is going to fly, is delusional.\n\nWe deserve this. We have let ourselves become LESS THAN ANIMALS.\n\nWhen does a lion, or any other animal, before a fight/ go look for another fucking lion to fight for him/them? \n\nWhen does a lion, after killing another lion, lets a group of other STRANGER lions saying: \"Oh, no. YOU killed a lion. Let's \"JUDGE\" YOU! YOU are going to Lion's Federal 'COURT\"! YOU are \"GUILTY\" of \"MURDER\" of a lion? \n\nWhen does a seagull lets other STRANGER seagulls say: \"Hey... YOU need a license to fish now. YOU are going to Municipal Seagull's Court!  We are going to JUDGE YOU! YOU are \"GUILTY\" for \"fishing without a license\".\n\nWhen does any animal \"thinks\", before being attacked and/or getting killed: \"I better not attack, or make any \"funny moves\". Maybe the other wolf will back up, \"PEACEFULLY\", and \"HONORABLY\".\n\n??? \n\nSo we deserve it.\n\nBut, I know what the fuck to do now. Not before.",
