They just said \"come with us\". DEAN SAID NOTHING.\nTHE HAMILTON Police were TOO \"non aggressive\". Where was the \"STAND BACK\"s and the \"DO NOT INTERFERE\"s you NORMALLY get? Did the cops suddenly become all \"peace and love\"?\nThis is a STAGED EXIT.\nNO ARREST IS EVER DONE LIKE THAT. EVER.\nYOU ARE ALL BEING PLAYED!",
