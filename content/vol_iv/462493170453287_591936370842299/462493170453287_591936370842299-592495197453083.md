   "message": "If he just lied about being on Bail, the cop probably warned him and negotiated the \"peaceful extraction\". They waited until The Fender (My Agent) was FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM DEAN before they grabbed him.\n\nThe Fender provided TOP NOTCH SECURITY the WHOLE CONFERENCE and DIDN'T LEAVE DEAN'S SIDE!\n\nThe other two agents I had there remained invisible. All did their job perfectly... except Dean Clifford.\n\nHe said NOTHING.\nThere was no \"Are you Dean Clifford\"? Just \"Come with us\".\n\nNo search, pat-down, or frisking. Nothing. This is confirmed by ALL trusted sources, and I dare say ALL sources that saw it.\n\nNO arrest is EVER executed like that. EVER.",
