   "message": "REMEMBER:\n\nDean Clifford wasn't cuffed.\nHe wasn't searched.\nHe was placed in...a PICKUP? NO BARRIER?\nMALL COPS DO MORE IN AN ARREST\nThe ROPE cops did NOT identify themselves. They just said \"come with us\". DEAN SAID NOTHING.\nTHE HAMILTON Police were TOO \"non aggressive\". Where was the \"STAND BACK\"s and the \"DO NOT INTERFERE\"s you NORMALLY get? Did the cops suddenly become all \"peace and love\"?\nThis is a STAGED EXIT.\nNO ARREST IS EVER DONE LIKE THAT. EVER.\n\nTo the cops reading this... Have YOU EVER detained/arrested somebody and executed it like that?\n\nDo you sit beside your UN-CUFFED, UN-SEARCHED PRISONER? We'd really like to hear about it! I have MANY questions about this innovative new arrest method!\n\nQuestion 1: WHY AREN'T YOU DEAD?",
