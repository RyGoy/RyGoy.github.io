   "message": "So, I find this whole scenario strange. Nobody has stated what Dean said, what the STRANGERS said... Dean just goes with them like \"no problem\" and the STRANGERS actually wait until his final day, right to the end to grab him. As far as I've heard, they did not give him any reason to take him and nobody knows where the hell he is? \n\nThis is weird.",
