   "message": "Nowadays, Atlas Shrugged and similar modern literature is reviewed in the same way Christians \"review\" their Bible.; They speak as experts and don't ACTUALLY READ THE FUCKING BOOK!\n\nThey then lie, when you point out the reality, by saying \"you're taking that out of context\".\n\n...at this point the discussion is best handled by bitch-slapping the speaker of such bullshit.",
