   "message": "Wow...\n\nThis is truly appalling to read. In fact, I may NEVER read another article by Salon.com again AND boycott Alternet.org as well.\n\nEVERY single word of this article is a blatant and outright fabrication. The \"message\" that they are claiming that the book sends, is LITERALLY, the EXACT opposite of what is actually written! \n\n(How do I know this? Because I'm reading \"Atlas Shrugged\", RIGHT NOW.)\n\nAnd people will believe this! Alternet has a reputation for being a reputable, cutting-edge news source. The vast majority of readers will see this article and accept every word as truth, without ever taking the time to pick the book up and investigate for themselves.\n\nThis is despicable in ways I can't even begin to describe. \n\nI was angry enough, just reading this book. A piece of literary fiction, written more than 50 years ago, that has been heralded as being one of the great books of our time, read the world over! But the further into the book I get, the more disgusted I am by the fact that people praise Ayn Rand as being a visionary, raved about this book...yet here we are, in 2013, LIVING in the world she describes and every one is too blind to see it\n\nFucking sheep...\n\nI'm too pissed off to say anything more.",
