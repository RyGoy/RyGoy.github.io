   "message": "oops ...my very bad...I'm cursing myself. Really. Just as too many think of the \"father, son, and holy ghost as one entity\" ready to serve them, i have a hard time, far too often, breaking up the identities of the person, trust and corporation as I think of them (in the back of my mind at least) as \"me\" (or there to serve me) which I repeatedly realize is wrong, hence your earlier warning of my need to be absolutely accurate, lest I screw myself royally. I should have said... if THE TRUST liens (\"my\") the Person, I want to be sure the TRUST is getting paid... Sorry. :(",
