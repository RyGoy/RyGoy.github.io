   "message": "Is there a repository where every instance of the PERSON is recorded and kept?. Can I access the info, or do I not bother worrying because it's not really my business unless they try to force me onto the seas of commerce. My thought is that it might be prudent of me to manage the affairs of my estate and address every account concerning the NEGOTIABLE  security interest in my wallet. <-- I'm also wondering this because, if I liened \"my\" PERSON, I want to be sure the TRUST is getting paid from every account with \"my\" PERSONS name on it. This also relates to my role as Executor of an estate. I need to find every existing account to determine the value of the estate before I can settle it. Obviously, I can't send registered mail to every business in the world where there may be an account.",
