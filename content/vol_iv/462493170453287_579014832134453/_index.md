   "message": "I�m not sure if I�ve had somewhat of an epiphany, or, if the following is a shit stain that will never get posted. Here it goes:\n\nIf I understand this correctly, from my new TTFL perspective, it is important that I understand that in a system which uses money of ACCOUNT, \"money\" concerning the Security Instrument in my wallet, can ALSO be realized/created WITHOUT my signature. \n\nAn accountant for example, can magically �create� a negative amount of money by registering a NEW ACCOUNT in a ledger, and by identifying the SECURITY INTEREST I have in my pocket/wallet, they are investing in a gamble that I will be willing to become the SURETY for the NEGATIVE amount of money they created. They are hoping that I won�t choose to discharge/set-off the debt, and, that they can trick me into providing them with money of EXCHANGE. \n\nIf I don�t provide them either my signature (which accepts SURETY), or MONEY of EXCHANGE, the ACCOUNTANT who �signed off� on the ledger entry, and, or, the UNDERWRITERS who BONDED the actions of the PUBLIC SERVANT PERSON who \"signed off\" on the requisition/order to the accountant to make the entry, will surely be held ACCOUNTABLE. If the accountant entered/created a large enough negative number, AND they don�t get ME to act as SURETY for the PERSON they recently CREATED in their new ledger entry - jobs will be lost, vessels will be sunk, as  BONDS become LIQUIDATED to settle the account.\n\nAND, if I have been smart enough to follow Scott�s advice, and have previously liened the name of the SECURITY INTEREST in my pocket/wallet, the credit applied (and intended to balance out the account), is mine to claim and enjoy through the TRUST which is handled by my corporation. Once I claim it, they have to create/source even more money to settle the account.\n\nSuch a scenario therefore, serves not only my financial interests, but it also servers my AGENDA (and perhaps Scott�s agenda) in that it undermines every institution which chooses to operate and act in such a manner. It punishes them for their complicity in this global fraud.\n\n**************\n\nScott, I recall you saying something about half of all math and the number zero. Were you referring to the fact that in a ledger dealing with MONEY OF ACCOUNT, half of all the numbers entered will be negative (on one side of zero), while the other half of all numbers entered will be POSITIVE (on the other side of zero) in order to balance the books (get them to RETURN TO ZERO)? \n\nAm I way off track with this train of thought? Tips, corrections, and constructive advice/criticism is welcome as usual.",
