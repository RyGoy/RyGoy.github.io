   "message": "I keep telling a friend of mine that just because some one phones you or sends you a piece of paper with a number on it doesn't mean you just send them money. Some people are so easily sucked into that scam it's no wonder they believe the piece of paper or phone call from the \"Oso Powerful Government\". I've been there. They just happen to have a lot of stupid bullies that work for them. Seems asking questions makes a lot of these pieces of paper somehow just vanish.",
