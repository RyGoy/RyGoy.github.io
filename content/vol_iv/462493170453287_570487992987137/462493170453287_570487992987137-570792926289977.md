   "message": "Okay Jeff, I just want to make sure I've got this straight. So you hate cops for all the evil, cop-ey things that they do, right? For infringing on peoples rights, behaving violently and basically, just using their badges and guns as an excuse to bully and inflict harm on innocent strangers?\n\nAnd you're SO sickened by these violations of basic human rights that your solution is to harm innocent children? Babies that did not ask to be born and have NO knowledge, hand or say in ANYTHING that their parents might be involved in?\n\nYou're telling me that you, as an honourable man, have decided that the only remedy here is to become an even BIGGER monster than the ones that you are facing?",
