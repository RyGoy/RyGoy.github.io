   "message": "Sorry \"Jeff\", but this is my last point, promise! I want to talk about the confusion a few comments back, the incident which led to this: \n\n-\"nevermind I thought you were talking to me it's obvious that you're talking to someone that I can't see them because they're too much of an idiot and have me blocked.\"\n\nI'd like to examine and discuss that statement, especially that bit at the end. We can extrapolate several things from this, the first being that someone has found (I assume, just) cause to block ALL communications from you. \n\nSecond, as you are unsure of who the person might be, one can therefore reasonably assume that there are MULTIPLE someones who have found (again, I assume, they're just) causes to obliterate your digital presence from their online world.\n\nNow I can't speak for the rest of the people reading this but personally, if I had MULTIPLE people in an online forum, complete strangers at that...people with NO vested personal interest or emotional attachments to me, go out of their way to block me just so that they wouldn't have to read the things that I post...I don't know that my assessment of the situation would be that *THEY* are the idiots here.",
