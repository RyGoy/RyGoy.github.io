   "message": "I don't know if anyone has noticed, but a number of you have gone to some lengths to prove my point.  I'm not actually annoyed.  \n\nThe closest emotion I can identify is embarrassment.  While you all swear you are eager to learn or to develop as people, you work tirelessly to prove that you are a) not learning anything, and b) seem fixated on causing disruption or focusing on hurting others.  \n\nI resent that you waste my time with your idiocy and endless fascination with your genitalia.  I'm not against having fun, and I'm for witty banter - occasionally blowing off steam is a healthy thing to do.\n\nAt this point, unless you have ANYTHING else to offer, be advised I'd cross the street not to have to deal with any of you.  I really hope this isn't the best you've got.",
