He says plenty of intelligent and often witty things. \n\nHOWEVER,\n\nSimply memorizing said witty and/or intelligent things and then indiscriminately regurgitating them into random threads does NOT make YOU appear witty OR intelligent. In fact, you'll find more often than not, it has the exact OPPOSITE of the desired effect. (Not pointing any fingers here or anything, \"Jeff\")",
