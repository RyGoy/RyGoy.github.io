   "message": "Actually, that is exactly what it means. If the ONLY thing you have to interject into a conversation oh, say, 90% of the time, is an EXACT quote of a \"Scottism\" that you have read IN THE EXACT SAME FUCKING FORUM, then YOU have injected NO value into the thread. \n\nYOU have put no thought into it...you are simply parroting something clever that you heard someone else say in the hopes that YOU will now appear clever.\n\nMost of the time, the quote you use isn't even relevant to the thread you're using it in. If you agree that Scott is right, try focusing on WHY he is right. If you understand the mechanics BEHIND the catch phrase, then YOU can converse on that. Explain the IDEA...don't just throw out the phrase without being able to back it up in conversation.",
