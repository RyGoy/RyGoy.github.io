   "message": "Stop typing and start thinking. This is the SIMPLE solution to your problems. \n\nThis whole shooting-babies-thing is a prime example. There are really only two options with that one; either you are a baby-killin-psychopath...or you're a sad man who's just telling people what he thinks that they want to hear, in a desperate attempt to fit in and be \"part of something\". \n\nSeeing as how your immediate reaction once the shooting-newborns plan was not met favourably, was to message me privately with a thinly-crafted lie about \"screening methods\" in a kind of pathetic attempt to back-pedal...my money is on Door #2.\n\nRather than worrying about \"saying the right things\" to impress the Admiral, try working on acquiring the knowledge and skills to be useful instead.",
