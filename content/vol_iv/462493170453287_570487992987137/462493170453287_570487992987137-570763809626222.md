   "message": "In case anyone missed the point of the original post, you were asked to consider using your brains as a consideration to yourselves and others.  I'm not telling you what to do.  I'm drawing attention to the fact that you post information which is not logical.  People respond to this non-information emotionally because now everyone is an expert in everything and can obviously parrot one or more sayings they have heard that might solve a problem.   \n\nDon't ask a question unless you can articulate the problem.  Have a goal.  Be brief but thorough.  Don't waste your time on the irrelevant or on pointless conjecture - here at least.  I don't really care what you do elsewhere.  \n\nThis request does not just apply to this arena; it will serve you well in every facet of your life.\n\nAnd stop it with the pointless drivel - don't pee on my thread.",
