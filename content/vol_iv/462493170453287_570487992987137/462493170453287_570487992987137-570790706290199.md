   "message": "Forgive me. I too, especially of late as I have started to become more comfortable with members, have come to enjoy the camaraderie to the point of participating in gregarious and almost mindless bantering far too often. I do however, take notice of your reliable guidance and insightful input Tara Duncan. I thank you for it. You are ceaselessly a breath of fresh air in here. We certainly would all benefit by treating this page more like a place of learning and less like a social club. Complete thoughts, proper sentence structure, correct spelling and staying focused on the topic at hand can only improve the threads. I do appreciate that this isn't a game show where we have to race to hit the button first and blurt out the first thing that comes to mind. As you indicate, the development of these skill-sets, combined with self discipline, can only serve us in the greater arena of our lives. I will do my best to do better! You have my word. I commit to demonstrating this to you and the group. Thanks again. :)",
