   "message": "the proper question:\nseems a man was stopped at a fork in the road where there were two others.\nthe man not knowing which way to go to get somewhere was told he could only ask ONE question. one of the 2 ALLWAYS lied, while the other ALLWAYS told the truth. Well sinse the man needed to go to see the king, he couldn't ask which one told what.\n(if you know the olsd story please elaborate)\nWhat was the question he had to ask?\n\nok, so 2 roads and 2 parties, is 4 answers, only one is correct. So the man asked one of the parties, what way would the OTHER say to go? (the correct question).\nthe answer from either is ALLWAYS going to be the wrong way.\n\nthis is part of the think wrong series. discuss;",
