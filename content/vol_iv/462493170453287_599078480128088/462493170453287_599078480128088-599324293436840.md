   "message": "i'm catchin up, at \"nees\" . i see what Fb code translates is 0174 �. 0169 �. thats ASCII code. it was/is part of pre windows (a grafic user interface, but also after writing machine language code which is only numerical. everything you see and/or do on a computer is translated from a numerical code either interacted as hexidecimal, decimal, binary, all things numbers translates interchangeably with any other number system language, but hard drives can only store data in binary (base 2) code in clusters bits/byte's (8 bits) etc, but RAM memory where a conputer does all its work is in hexidecimal (16) base 16.\n\nbinary, base 2 is 0 or 1, like a light switch its either on or off.\nhexidecimal is 0123456789ABCDEF, A=10, F=15 and if you want 22 you write that as F7. binary is simple and dumb, hex writes huge numbers in small spaces.",
