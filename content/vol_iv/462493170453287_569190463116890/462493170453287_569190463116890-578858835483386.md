   "message": "Now I'm really laughing. \n\nI can almost piss myself laughing  when I entertain the  \"fact\" that Pete is so very SURE that his SPIDY SENSE is always 100% accurate and yet doesn�t seem to realize the obvious: his statement is based ENTIRELY ON BELIEF.  \n\nFYI For those that give a hoot, my son and I have been fortunate enough to learn from and spend a number of hours in person with the Chief - not to mention time spent on the phone. I�ve even been fortunate enough to help him succeed with his legal pursuits on one occasion. I am confident that the Chief's \"SPIDY SENSE\" of us will reveal, should he be asked, that he doesn�t think my 10 year old and I are some kind of cop duo tag team. BELIEVE AS YOU WISH. I do find your and Pete's BELIEFS so very entertaining.",
