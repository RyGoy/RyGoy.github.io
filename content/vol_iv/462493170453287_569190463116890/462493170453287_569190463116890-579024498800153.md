I particularly liked  your comment on the one where you served noticed to the police, where you commented: \"Shine the light of truth, cockroach scatter\". So true and funny! Many hate the truth. But that is to be expected as anger is one of the stages of the ego dying and trying to protect itself in defense of it's bullshit and \"non truthing\" ways. BTW Great Park performance. Did you put that together?",
