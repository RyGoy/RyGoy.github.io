   "message": "Scott, as you've probably heard, there is another 'Town Hall-meeting' coming up at City Hall. This time about 'carding'/street-checks by the police, making these 'contact-forms' with people they do ID checks with out of the blue. Something tells me that somehow-someway, they are able to turn-a-buck out of this for themself. Are the police able to somehow generate revenue for themselves by conducting these 'carding' practices?",
