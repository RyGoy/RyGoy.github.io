Deposits with Chief Financial Officer.\n[Amended 2005-04-14 by By-law No. 331-2005]\n\nDuly executed copies of all agreements, including all insurance and certificates thereof, all contracts, BONDS, letters of credit and other SECURITY for the DUE PERFORMANCE thereof, and all other documents executed by or on behalf of the City shall be delivered to the Chief Financial Officer for safekeeping.\n\nhttp://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_071.pdf\n\nDerek:  Police Officers are one thing Scott, but would EVERY City of Toronto-employee also have a Performance/Hazard/Surety/Risk Bond whatever they exactly call it, say for instance- even a Librarian?\n\nScott Duncan: Yes.\nALL government employees do.\n\nPete Daoust: And when a government employee is lying to me, and I can prove it, does that put him/her in a HAZARDIOUS location ?\n\nScott Duncan: No. If you claim (their bond), and then lien their bond, they can't work for the government anymore.\n\nDerek Moran: RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nMore and more, municipalities are adopting risk management strategies to address public liability. Generally, risk management strategies seek to minimize the effects and costs of public liability suits against a municipality. This involves identifying\npotential hazards and implementing the appropriate measures to reduce or eliminate them in your community.\nYou may find that the biggest areas for potential liability are\npublic works or parks and recreational services. Risk management initiatives therefore tend to concentrate on these service areas.\n\nhttp://www.mah.gov.on.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=4965\n\nRobert Cormier: How do we claim their bond? Through default and estoppel by way of a NOTICE concerning an infraction of clubhouse rules, and/or damage/injury to us by attributing a PUBLIC name to ME? (SCOTT CLICKED LIKE on this)\n\nDerek Moran: CLAIM NOTICE\n\nYou've harmed me. So let this NOTICE serve as INTENT, that i INTEND, to CLAIM your Bond, Lien your Bond, and Liquidate your Bond.....fuckers.\n\n..i wonder how often someone from the City of Toronto opens up THAT envelope?",
