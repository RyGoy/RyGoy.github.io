   "message": "No harm no foul - Bobis Youruncle. :) It's obvious that I had falsely assumed you had read the entire thread and therefore my post about how I was under direct instruction (on this particular matter/point) by the Chief, and, that my statement about my need to establish a NOTICE OF CLAIM came directly from him. (If such a claim seems too ludicrous and just too plain dumb to accept, feel free to verify my assertions with him - if it pleases you.) \n\nThat's why I found it so funny when I got your numerous frustrated responses, one of which ended with FUCK and OUT, as if to indicate I (or in this case the Chief) am/is just plain thick and obviously can't, or, are unwilling to understand that a notice of claim is not required. Or perhaps, that I, which INCLUDES/MEANS the Chief in this case, doesn't have a clue what he's speaking about, and witness you sign off in frustration and hostility. \n\nAs I said, sometimes, it's almost too funny in here.",
