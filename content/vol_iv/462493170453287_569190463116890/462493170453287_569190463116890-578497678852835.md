   "message": "RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nMore and more, municipalities are adopting risk management strategies to address public liability. Generally, risk management strategies seek to minimize the effects and costs of public liability suits against a municipality. This involves identifying\npotential hazards and implementing the appropriate measures to reduce or eliminate them in your community.\nYou may find that the biggest areas for potential liability are\npublic works or parks and recreational services. Risk management initiatives therefore tend to concentrate on these service areas. \n\nhttp://www.mah.gov.on.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=4965",
