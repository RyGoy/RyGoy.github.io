   "message": "At the end of the night, while he was outside walking to the parking-garage, i asked Deputy Chief Michael Frederico what he had thought of what i had to say. He pensively looked at the ground and told me- \"What you had to say tonight.....it really got me thinking. In terms of the legal system, relative to the Constitution, in regards to the law, and the way things were MEANT to be\"...then he didnt really encourage me, but more suggested to me i make a DEPUTATION to expand upon what i had said at the next upcoming Toronto Police Services Board meeting\n\nFunny thing...there is NO definition for DEPUTATION in The Dictionary of Canadian Law OR Black's Law 9th! :/",
