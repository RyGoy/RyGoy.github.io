   "message": "Scott Duncan: Toronto was dissolved in 1997 and replaced with administrative zones as defined in the CITY OF TORONTO ACT. It is no longer a municipality nor is it a city, legally. It is a commercial administrative zone. You have NO rights there, and nobody even noticed.\n\nGayle, I take it back. I didn't know you were studying to harm strangers for a living through fraud.\n\nFor the record, I was called to the bar and responded \"Why\"?\n\nYou are entering a life of fraud and are beneath contempt. Derek can't construct a coherent sentence, but he can look at himself in the mirror.\n\nHow do you do it?",
