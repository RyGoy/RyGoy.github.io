   "message": "Well, there are many factors which point towards your PERSON. We have, as of late, acknowledged that our BC is a security of the PERSON, you have a PERSON and are responsible for it (else you might land up like Leigh), the PERSON is an account and new PERSONs seem to get created often, ie., bank accounts, credit cards, traffic tickets, etc. The LEGAL TENDERization upon this PERSON (for commercial use only) keeps you running around trying desperately to stay out of some form of \"troubles\". The fact that your signature creates \"money\" for ME to benefit from as Authorized Rep for this PERSON (for accounting purposes only)... \n\nYou start thinking almost TOO MUCH to try to purify it all to only ONE entity regarding all this information in your head.",
