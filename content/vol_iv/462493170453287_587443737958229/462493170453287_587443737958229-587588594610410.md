   "message": "that matter was for the false arrest (because I didn't identify myself on , I sent the notice of mistake with the tickets back via registered mail...the prosecutor was acting like they didn't get them till I said I have the receipt, then it was suddenly in the judges file...he read it then said it was \"nonsensical\"...now when I sent that in I did not select one of the options I just wrote no contract no consent and sent it in with the notice...that was there reason for dismissing the appeal....@ Pete Daoust monday is for the dog getting loose and \"attacking\" two dogs twice her size...no damage reported but I got a court date just the same",
