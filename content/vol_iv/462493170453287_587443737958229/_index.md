   "message": "so as I was being railroaded today the fella in the black robe was quick to bring up meads and meads and Duncun...and some other case law crap...In any case, I lost, rather than being concerned with justice, they were more concerned about me not selecting the correct box on the tickets...yet the secretary said they sent a notice of tril, but the crown P today said there was no notice sent because i didn't check the box, said my notice of mistake was \"nonsensical\" which led to a discussion on \"persons\" and according to the justice I am a person, though he would not answer yes or no when i asked \"is it true I have a right to be recognized as a person before the law?\"...he just kept saying \"you are a person\" then dismissed the appeal and got up and left, lol clearly I was nervous and a bit slow, anyway that was my day in court...and sadly I never got to face my accuser, the lying cop that started this shit :( win or lose that was my main goal, but my ignorance of the rules and procedures of are lacking apparently...I'm back Monday for another matter, hopefully the jitters will ease up, lol",
