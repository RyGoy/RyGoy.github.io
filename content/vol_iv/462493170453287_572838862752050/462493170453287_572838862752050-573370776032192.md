   "message": "I think I might have posted on a thread in this group that a cancelled stamp is like a poor man's notary. I read somewhere that when you stamp the reverse side of a document before you file it in the court record, if the judge is on the take, he can't just turn the paper over and say he doesn't see anything. The stamp seals the document. Putting on the reverse side makes it one document, whereas a single page is somehow technically two documents, like a box... just my interpretation, anyway.",
