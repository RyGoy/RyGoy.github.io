   "message": "I have used the following to refuse five tickets totalling $2,990.00. I remember first, to keep the peace with my fellow man. When a Bonded Insurance Policy Enforcement Officer presumes to have the authority to issue a ticket in a name to which he or she is not the lawful holder in due course of, 'my name', I accept the presentment. It means nothing if I accept the ticket at roadside. I take the ticket to the post office within seventy two hours and refuse it. The way I refuse a ticket is this;\n\nI print in red ink, upwards left to right on the face of the ticket,\n\nRefused for Cause\nWithout Dishonour\nWithout Prejudice\nWithout Recourse\nNon Assumpsit\n\nI then have the postal clerk stamp the ticket, a copy of the stamped ticket(an original for my records) and the envelope. I then mail the ticket to the address on the back of the ticket for payment or dispute.",
