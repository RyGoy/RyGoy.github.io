   "message": "Hi folks,\nI�ve been going over posts to find out about the VOIDing that you do and from what I�ve read, if I received a unilateral contract/speeding fine in the post from the GARDA (Police), how do I void the ticket? \nWould I put VOID (in red) on the fine in maker/pen, do I then return to sender by registered post?\nWould I put the following too on the front of the envelope or would this be a mistake?\n\nRETURN TO SENDER.\nI DO NOT RECOGNISE YOU.\nI DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR INTENT.\nWE HAVE NO INTERNATIONAL TREATY.\nNO ASSURED VALUE.\nNO SURETY ACCEPTED.\nWE HAVE NO CONTRACT.\n\nIf this step did not work for what ever reason and it happened to proceed to Court, the GARDA would be prosecuting and not a solicitor/lawyer. \n\nWould I send the Garda an affidavit and a NoM? \nWhen the case would be called would you, except the name that is called GARDA OINK vs. LEE EDGELY? Or rebut that NAME called and/or just state for the record that you are there on a conditional appearance (there is no special appearance in Ireland. If there is a special appearance I can not find anything on it.) And then reserve all rights?\n\nThe Garda would then automatically walk to the stand to speak, would I let him speak before anything else happens? then rebut everything and/or call POINT OF ORDER before he has started/finished speaking? \n\nThen continue with the question of asking did you receive my affidavit and NoM, (YES).\nAnswer the questions GARDA, because this can not proceed until I can UNDERSTAND the nature of these proceedings.\nAND KEEP REPEATING and POINT OF ORDER until I get answers from him? \nOr the Judge asks me how I wish to proceed.\n\nPlease help me as I feel confused sometimes when I read some posts.",
