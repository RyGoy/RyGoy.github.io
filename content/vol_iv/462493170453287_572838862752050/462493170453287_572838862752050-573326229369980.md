   "message": "Lee Edgely, the only original I keep is a copy of the stamped ticket which also has a stamp.\n\nThe stamp has the location of the post office and the date. I tell the clerk that I need a stamp so I can show later that I did send the document in on time and from where. How you deal with people has a great impact on the results you get from them. I convey the importance of their official stamp on an official document. It does not hurt to pander to people's egos. Telling the clerk that you want to be able to prove that 'This' document went into 'This' envelope and was witnessed by 'This' honest official goes a long way. The stamp indicates witness rather than endorsing an agreement. The ticket is endorsed (signed) by a Bonded Insurance Policy Enforcement Officer when it is written.",
