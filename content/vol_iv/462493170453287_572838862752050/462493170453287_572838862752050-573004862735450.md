   "message": "I went to the Post Office today to send something to the Government by Registered Mail. The usual lady i deal with who is cool was not there. I usually get what im sending weighed first, then i pay, then i go get the stamped envelope and the letter photocopied at the photocopier right next to the Postal Outlet (inside a Shoppers Drug Mart), but, i always get my LETTER stamped by them too before i photocopy it. There was a new-girl there today, told me that will be the only time she will stamp my letter in the future because, as she said- \"Oh we cant DO that. By us STAMPING your letter, this means that we are AGREEING to whatever you are doing here\"\n\nIs there something ILLEGAL Scott for a Canada Post worker to 'stamp' your letter, the same as they STAMP the envelope, the same as they STAMP the back of the registered-mail-ticket they give you?",
