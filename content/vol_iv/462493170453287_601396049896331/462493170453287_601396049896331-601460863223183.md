   "message": "It's just a scare tactic. \"Bailiffs\" have been to my door with fraudulent documents claiming they were issued by the local sheriff court. I took them to the police and the police told them to stay away, that was over a year ago. If anyone comes to your door with a warrant, make sure it has the following 1. The court Coat of Arms at the top. 2. The name of the Sheriff who issued it. 3. A wet ink  signature of said Sheriff (not a facsimile)4. The date. 5. The Court Seal. If it does not have these it is not valid. The assholes will make up false documents as did the \"bailiffs\" at my door.  There has to have been a court hearing under due process to issue a warrant.",
