   "message": "Yeah I was aware it was a scare tactic but I might incure extra costs for a \"dog handler\" ffs! I pay all my bills except my tv licence, out of principle. I have a big issue with the price of gas/electric (don't we all) but 1 mth late on a gas payment and they've applied for a warrant of entry with the purpose of installing a pre paid meter, that I don't want because they're a complete scam! Where the fuck do these guys get off on this? They've applied for fuck all! I wonder if there is a way I can find out if they're talking porkies and then take them to the fing cleaners?",
