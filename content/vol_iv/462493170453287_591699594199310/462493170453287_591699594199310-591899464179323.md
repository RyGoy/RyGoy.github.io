   "message": "That's because it is not a Court for men, it is a court for PERSONS, Persons are vessels, vessels are containers that hold estates, containers are for shipping, shipping operates under the laws of the sea, if that man steps into the court, he gives correction and subject matter for the name of the PERSON, he should never have walked into the court, therefor rendering the person appearing without subject matter, rendering the charge as VOID in LAW. The man assumed that the Court was a Common Law Court or even maritime, it was just the tribunal of the foreign governing corporation. (Admiralty) It's as simple as that, and when the STATE makes a mistake, the agents of the STATE can be sued, (NOT THE STATE) but the man, by walking into the tribunal, claimed the \"name\" of the vessel appearing in the Tribunal, rendering him to make the mistake and not the STATE. The FRAUD (Act) is very complex, and you must have a strong understanding of the BIBLE (TRIBAL) law before you can understand what a PERSON is and where the PERSON came from and the roll of the PERSON in society. A PERSON is a ship, a ship must be a slave, (Trustee) the ship has an administrator, (Capetian) and the Capetian must have a \"Director\" being the owner of the ship. The Crew answers to the Capetian and the Capetian answers to the Director, any change in that order of command and it is mutiny-piracy-theft-extortion-fraud.",
