   "message": "Yes, but you LIE about what you have already done... as if you can \"skip\" it.\n\nYour questions reveal volumes. You're disillusioned Menard Cultie. I see THAT all too often too.\n\nI do not tolerate contrary \"beliefs\" because anything that contradicts what I say, IS WRONG.\n\nI don't CARE if that hurts your feelings or if you think I'm \"arrogant\" for saying I'm right. Reality doesn't care.\n\nYou will save yourself a HUGE amount of abuse/grief/time if you stop questioning IF I'm right, and start questioning WHY I'm right.",
