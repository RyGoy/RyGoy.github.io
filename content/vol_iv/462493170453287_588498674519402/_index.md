   "message": "(copy-Paste)\nI was on that Thread where Rob, wouldn't answer your Legal Tender ???? He just posted this!\n\nRobert Menard\n\nA note is 'legal tender' not because it is marked as such, but because if tendered and accepted payment is achieved and if refused the debt is extinguished by abandonment of the claim. In any event settlement is achieved. \n\n Markings on a note stating 'This note is legal tender for a specific type of debt' may be deemed to be conclusive evidence of the note being legal tender for that specific type of debt. It does not however generate the status. It merely confirms it.\n\n For a note to be deemed conclusively as not being legal tender, it must be marked as such.\n\n Notes not marked as legal tender, may still in fact be legal tender, if they fulfil the function of payment, and refusal of them extinguishes the debt. If the note in question is a method of payment which is statutorily acknowledged, then they are arguably legal tender, even though not marked. It is the function not the label which defines what is or is not legal tender. Counterfeit money is marked as legal tender, though it certainly is not. The label follows the function. \n\n This Note is legal tender for all debts public and private.\n\n There is nothing to suggest that all notes which are legal tender must be suitable for debts both public and private. There is nothing which suggest that something which is legal tender for a public debt must also be legal tender for a private one, or vice versa. There is nothing to suggest that a specific specie of money marked thusly is the only form of legal tender. \n\n It is entirely possible that there are other forms of payment, which though not marked as such are legal tender, but only for specific types of debts.",
