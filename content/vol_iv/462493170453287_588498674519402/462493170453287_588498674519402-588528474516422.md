   "message": "Thats the kicker right ther. I get an offer from a collection agency, and I call those sumbitches up and ask them why their contacting me. I have loads of un. Then I follow up with a letter asking why they spoke with me about this alleged debt without b]verifying who I am (The name on this correspondance I'm looking at is ROGER FLEURY, the account number is *******-****, and I'm wondering what its about. \"Oh, you owe x amount of dollars\")  Boom, fdcpa violation.\n\nAs far as this pc goes, if its tender for law, would that be legal tender?\n\nThing is, perhaps you are talking about facts that your experience has led you to believe are true, and that's cool too. Like I said, I've been able to use some of thee documents to follow the rabbit hole, and its gotten me quite the distance, until I found out I can just use there law against them in court. \n\nFun stuff!",
