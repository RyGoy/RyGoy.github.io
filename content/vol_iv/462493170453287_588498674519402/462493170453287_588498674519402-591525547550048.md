   "message": "When I was 13, freshly arrived in this protestant new foster home, in west island Montreal, there was this kid Daniel in that place, 1 year younger than me, the first hour I was in that home, I figured out fast this this Daniel guy was having a rough time in that place, we were 9 boys in that place, and maybe 2 weeks after I was arrived, I have met this huge bimbo guy, I don't even remember his name, we were in the school yard, after school hours....\n\nPLAYING BASEBALL.... :P , and at one point, Bimbo decided to have fun with Daniel......and me, I have lost it, I jumped on this Bimbo guy and hurt him very bad......bad enough that Bimbo started to cry and begged me to stop beating him, and I finally stopped......\n\nNo one ever made fun of Daniel again the 16 months I spent there.....\n\nI never met Bimbo guy as an adult, I wish I could meet him today :D\n\nTrue Story .",
