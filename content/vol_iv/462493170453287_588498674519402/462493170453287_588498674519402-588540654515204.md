   "message": "Roger Paparrazzi Fleury you have claimed to have read my works, and follow that with drivel about \"Suing\" and \"attorney\".\n\nYou claim to have watched all of Paul's work (Money as debt 1-3) but still don't grasp money.\n\nThat's why I ask if you are a Christian. Lying is what theists do, but only the Christians think they are telling the truth when they do.",
