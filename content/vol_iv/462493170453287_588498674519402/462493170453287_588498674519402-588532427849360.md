   "message": "when did I say anything about bitcoin?! erhaps I've misssed it, but I do understand that money is illegal. I got that part. The part I don't get is that currency is money. Fed notes are a form of currency representing money on account of the United States, but they aren't money. Bitcoins are this medium of exchange that is apparently a form of currency, but still not money...\n\nWhat I'm gathering from the thins you say is that currency is not money. Money is gold or silver, or some other standard of measurment that maintains value over time (gold isn't rising in price, dollars are falling in value), easily transferred and carried, etc... Thats like, what? First base?",
