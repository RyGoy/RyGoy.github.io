Where on the note does it say that?\n\nLet's look at it:\n\nTHIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER\n\nTHIS NOTE = THE FUCKING FIAT NOTE ACTING AS \"CURRENCY\"\n\nIS = It is what it is.\n\nLEGAL = ACTS AND STATUTES WITH THE FORCE OF LAW ENACTED BY PARLIAMENT\n\nTENDER = UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE UPON USE\n\nWhat Menard is doing (since he can't lie through omission) is the recursive \"proof\" argument, like the ever popular \"The bible is true because it says so in the bible\".\n\nIt's bullshit. Why?\n\nBECAUSE HE'S USING ACCOUNTING AND LEGAL TERMS\n\nDEBT\nDISCHARGE\nSETTLEMENT\nABANDONMENT\n\nALL FUCKING LEGAL TERMS, AND FOR FUCK SAKES, STOP WASTING YOUR TIME WITH THIS SHIT-STAIN THAT IS ROBERT MENARD!",
