   "message": "QUOTES ~ President Woodrow Wilson made regarding his decision allowing the Federal Reserve to exist.\nA) (6 years after he signed into law the Federal Reserve act) �I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is now controlled by its system of credit. We are no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.\nB) �A little group of willful men, representing no opinion but their own, have rendered the government of the US helpless.�\nC) �If there are men in this country big enough to own the government of the United States, they are going to own it.�\nD) �If monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of government. I do not expect monopoly to restrain itself.�\n\nSee a copy of a report on the federal Reserve: \n Modern Money Mechanics Report on the Federal Reserve \nSee the accompanying Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkehQ19dDKA\nAlso see these reports: http://cafr1.com/everwonder.html\n \n\n�If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless in the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.� ~ Thomas Jefferson",
