   "message": "\"You should still be ONLY making DEPOSITS!\nStop looking for shit and pay attention to the LEGAL MECHANICS. DEPOSITS are not INCOME. INCOME tax is for INCOME, not DEPOSITS. That is all you need to know.\"\n\nI got this from Mackximus' \"Gold Nuggets\" document and I have good reasons to think Scott wrote it.  My CPA's have always wanted the reconciled bank statements to determine \"INCOME\".  They claim that \"DEPOSITS\" are \"INCOME\" and \"CHECKS\" (outgoing money) are \"EXPENSES\".  Then they subtract the difference and tax it.  (Maybe a little more happens after that, but you get it) \n\nIs this because my corporations in the past weren't \"Trust Holding Companies\"?",
