   "message": "i think there is an inherent problem with basing our entitlements & drawing references from the bible,constitutions or history books. are we that lost we cannot correlate the facts & define things for ourselves going forward? the bible seems to be a collection of books/stories with additions & ommisions .... and as covered on this page has been translated & interpreted already for your benefit. imho the purpose of this page is to draw us away from the pointless exercise of trying to find remedy within their construct.",
