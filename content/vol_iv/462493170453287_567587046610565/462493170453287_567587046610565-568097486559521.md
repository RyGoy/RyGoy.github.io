   "message": "Well im not a Bible-thumper at all. But i do view The Bible in terms of a book that 'they' have to follow, and in that sense, their weakness. So if 'they,' have it in 'their' own book Genesis 1:26-28, that man was made in his/whoever's likeness, and that 'we' were granted dominion over all of the earth and every creepeth, yadda yadda, then, i can live with that! If they said it, they should 'do it!' :)",
