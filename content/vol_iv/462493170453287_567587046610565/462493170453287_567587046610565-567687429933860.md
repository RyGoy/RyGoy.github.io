   "message": "Many of the arguments in the blog talk posted above remind me of talks given by Winston Shrout. While Winston seems to believe in a sky daddy, the talks I'm referring to in which he addresses the bible aren't laden with a sky daddy message. Overall, in them, he speaks of the bible as a code of sorts where common law, trust law, commercial law, societies, the workings of courts, notices, avoiding controversy, establishing your own law, and ultimately a guide revealing that the earth is truly our inheritance. He infers that we are kings who can create our own laws to gain access to the \"promised land\". I wonder if the nobles might have hidden such code in the King James version to assure that the path to freedom is plain to see for the most educated (their progeny), or, is Winston way off base with such assertions?",
