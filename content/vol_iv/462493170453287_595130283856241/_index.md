   "message": "I'd like to start a discussion on the effect of a lien on the legal name has on things like mortgages, cars etc. I'm feeling a bit cloudy in my comprehension of a few things still....If there is a mortgage in the persons name for example, bringing the house into the trust would be opening up the private trust to the public so we don't want that. Say there is a willingness on the part of the corporation  to continue to pay the mortgage....\n\nDoes the corporation send notice the bank that it will be paying that debt monthly and that will take care of it? \nIs there anything needed to be known when it comes time to renew the mortgage (the corporation will be the customer of the bank this time)",
