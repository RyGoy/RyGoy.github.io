   "message": "There is still the fundamental flaw of actual presentment and acceptance. With registered post you have a third party presenter of sorts who aquires a signature (albeit in a digital pad) but its nevertheless a voluntary authorization of acceptance, whereas opening an email is not. Maybe some family member opened it unauthorized and deleted it...the email presentment legislation is just like a corp sending you a letter/bill ect via normal post...there's no evidence YOU received it, only that it may have been sent.\n\nIt's simply the logical progression of democracy to end in totalitarianism, because the trustees realize every offer they make to the beneficiaries of indenture adjustment in alleged compliance with the settlers intent  is generally accepted by majority via conduct and behavior...there is always the private though that us governed by the right to contract. That will never go away because its the exact grounds upon which the public use to continue legislating.",
