Send, via registered mail, to the government that new email address, and instruct them that this is the OFFICIAL email address for the person you happen to have in your pocket\n\n3. Don't forget to give them the PASSWORD of that new official person's email address, to replace the defunct postal code.\n\n:-D\n\nI would DEFINITLY do this, seriously... :-D",
