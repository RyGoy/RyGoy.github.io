   "message": "Police have served summons' to \"hard to serve\" people on FB. Police have gone to the courts complaining they can't serve someone, however, they notice the person is regularly on FB. The courts have started condoning serving a summons in this way. Soon it'll be serving a summons to your phone, maybe even your car's computer. \"Hello this is OnStaR, you are to appear in your local Provincial court next Tuesday and reference file #12345. Consider yourself served. Thanks for choosing OnStar. Please let us know if there is anything else we can do to help\"",
