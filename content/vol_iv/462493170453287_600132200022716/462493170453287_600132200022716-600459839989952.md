   "message": "<<The Emergency Task Force (ETF) is the tactical unit of the Toronto Police Service (TPS). It is mandated to deal with high risk situations like hostage taking, emotionally disturbed persons, high risk arrests, warrant service and protection details. The unit was created in 1965, and inspired the television show Flashpoint. An earlier non-SWAT Riot and Emergency Squad emerged in 1961.[1] Part of its role is now undertaken by the ETF, Public Safety and Emergency Management and the Mounted Unit. The ETF is a fully manned 24 hours a day tactical response team.[2]\n\nUnlike most SWAT teams, the ETF is not a pure paramilitary unit. The ETF mission profile includes terrorism threats.>>",
