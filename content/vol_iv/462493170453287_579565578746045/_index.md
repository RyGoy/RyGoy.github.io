   "message": "Traffic Ticket Bill of Exchange No.1\n\nJanuary the 10th, 2013, while I was administrating a steering wheel, and a gaz pedal, and a brake pedal, for the person I happen to have in my pocket, which is named PIERRE DAOUST, a private contractor stopped me, he has a gun on him :(\n\nSo I asked him if I was OBLIGE to give him the person�s name, he said YES. So since he had a gun, and I don�t, I gave him the name of the person I happen to have in my pocket.\n\nThe fuck up in all this is that �me�, as a Man, I don�t get to be recognize in ALL this shit, these guys are looking for PERSONS��so hey, I have one :)\nSo he proceed with the preparation of a Bill of Exchange for PIERRE DAOUST, yes traffic tickets ARE bill of exchange.\n\nI took it, since I am the SOLE authorized administrator for PIERRE DAOUST, and brought it in my office. After verifying all this, I could not find any CONTRACT hooked between PIERRE DAOUST, and the city of montreal. \n\nSo I sent back this BoE written NO CONTRACT on it.\n\nBeginning of July 2013, I received a NOTICE from the city of Montreal, with a Bill of Exchange of $295.00 :D\n\nOn that NOTICE, it says that PIERRE DAOUST has been found GUILTY of something, and PIERRE DAOUST has been JUDGE for something :/ .\n\nSo I simply discharged that debt for PIERRE DAOUST, and sent a request to City of Montreal with 2 simple questions, for my OWN curiosity.\n\nPlease send me the NAME, ADDRESS and inscription number of the PERSON who decided to enter a plea for PIERRE DAOUST, and the NAME, ADDRESS and inscription number of the PERSON who judge PIERRE DAOUST�..nothing fancy, just 2 simple questions.\n\nThey�ve replied that I had to CALL them to have answer on these questions, and that if I don�t call them, They will not follow up with this matter.\n\nSo I called :D �..and of course, record that call, the lady named LISE who spoke with me on the phone, was trying to scares me with ALL that would happen if I don�t PAY the tickets, I stopped her several time during the conversation and ask her to LISTEN to me�.so I had to raise my voice a bit��and I told her to FOCUS on the 2 questions, I told her that I don�t give a shit about ANYTHING else�..\n\nShe finally answered :D �.and confirmed that a computer system entered a plea on PIERRE DAOUST, and a computer system JUDGE PIERRE DAOUST. I said THANK YOU and hung up :D\n\nSo I have wrote a nice NOTICE, you guys knows how good of an ADMINISTRATOR I am :D saying that the BoE was discharged, unless they can prove otherwise, the Bank of Canada accept it, unless they can prove otherwise, There was no DEFECT on the instrument, unless they can prove otherwise, The city of Montreal did not REFUSED the administration process so far, unless they can prove otherwise.\n\nAnd PIERRE DAOUST has been judge by a computer system, and a plea has been entered for PIERRE DAOUST by a computer system, I can email the audio recording to you for your file :D\n\nI gave them 10 days to REFUSE the administration process used concerning that BoE, and an affidavit to prove ANY of the points above.\n\nSo, 10 days after, I received a very small letter from them CONFIRMING the Name of the �Justice� who pleaded for PIERRE DAOUST, and judged PIERRE DAOUST. :D\nThat�s it that�s all��\n\nMy thinking is that THEY just could NOT leave that computer system thing open, they were fucked with this�.and that was October the 8th, 2013.\nI have NOT received anything regarding a refusal concerning the administration process used to discharged that debt. Maybe Scott can say something about this ?\n\nI will come back with Traffic Ticket Bill of Exchange No.2 Shortly, which is very interesting as well :D\n\nAgain�..my INTENTS are to get the TRUTH from these PUBLIC SERVANTS, if I amd a SLAVE, I need to know, and want the chains that goes with the title, I want these chains via REGISTERED mail :P\n\nThanks\nPete",
