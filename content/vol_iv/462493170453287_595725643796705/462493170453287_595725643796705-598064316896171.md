   "message": "Yess Bev..I'm sitting in court right now. Papers said 11:30...I'm here but the doors are locked. No ones said how long I'm supposed to wait...is this a no show on their part?\n\nMy intention here is to find out who the hell the harmed party is...acquire this disclosure for consideration..for I do not UNDERSTAND why I am here.\nMaybe then return it voided, with a NoM and/or a letter of apology and a request for FORGIVENESS \n\nStill an empty locked court room",
