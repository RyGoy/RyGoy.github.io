   "message": "I'm still a little confused......., \" as a MAN who is not lawfully entitled to the BENEFITS of a BIRTH CERTIFICATE \".  What exactly are the \"Benefits\"?  If I'm the sole beneficiary then wouldn't I be entitled to the benefits?  Unless the benefits include being prosecuted and owned.  Are there any benefits that I would want to claim that are associated to the BC?  If so, what are they, and should a distinction be made to wanted benefits and unwanted?
