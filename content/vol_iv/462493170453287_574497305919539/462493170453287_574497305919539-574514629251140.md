   "message": "I can totally get that and not have to go anywhere!\n\n...oh wait... MAYBE Dean Clifford has some amazing insight/knowledge that I do not possess! He may be revealing the secrets of the universe at this seminar!\n\n...well, I'll just have to live in blissful ignorance. Weed and hookers could have saved me and lead me to the enlightened path of Freeman Jesus (PRAISE FREEMAN JESUS!), but alas, I shall be indulging in these pleasures on the water, and thus shall miss Freeman Jesus' Earth-Shattering revelations.\n\nTL;DR - No weed and hookers, No Scott Duncan.",
