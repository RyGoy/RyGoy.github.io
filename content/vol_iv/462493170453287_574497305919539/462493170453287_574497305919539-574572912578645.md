   "message": "Your comments are moot, Scott, as you already have an engagement on that date as my sex toy.  \n\nI should also mention that Scott does not GO to see people.  People who want to see him ASK to be invited to come.  \n\nBefore you get your knickers in a knot thinking this is untrue or the world unfair, let me assure you that's just the way it is.  Also as an interesting aside I don't see the value in paying to hear someone speak when we've exchanged dialogue more than once in my living room.",
