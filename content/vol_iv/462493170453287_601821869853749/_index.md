   "message": "Hey guys, this is my first post on this page, none of you know me but I have read most of your information :) just got a quick question for anyone with a spare second. I've just received my first two letters from HM Revenue & Customs (UK tax office), the first thing I notice is that my name on both letters is in full capital letters, kind of made me laugh. The question is, do I return them to sender (no contract) or write them a letter in response asking for proof of why I am obliged to pay tax? (El Spaniardo style) Decisions decisions, this could be fun. Any info would be very much appreciated, thank you :)",
