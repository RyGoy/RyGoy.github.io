   "message": "If i'm honest, I haven't even opened the letters, I am aware that I am very close to paying tax, as I have earned near enough the minimum amount required in my place of work before having to pay tax. I didn't open the letters as I thought it may be a good idea to just return them to sender without even bothering to read it, as the name on the letter is for the person in my pocket and as the sole authorized administrator I do not wish to contract with the corporation in any way, which includes reading their junk mail. But you're right, I am just jumping to conclusions, I suppose it's just a good time to get some information on the worst case scenario of me having to pay any forms of tax :) sorry if it was misleading in any way",
