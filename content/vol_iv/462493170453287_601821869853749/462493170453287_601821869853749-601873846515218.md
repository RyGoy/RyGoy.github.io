   "message": "Well to my knowledge they are trying to attach a debt to the legal PERSON (who I may happen to have in my pocket?), I am also aware that tax is statutory which is only a corporate regulation, not law, and as the administrator of the ''person in my pocket'' I do not wish to, nor do I have to enter into any form of contract with HMRC. I have the right and the power to decline any contract I am confronted with, and to be coerced into signing said contracts would make it an unlawful contract. I hope that I am on the right path haha",
