   "message": "Just got an email informing me that the Venus project is still going hard and has a new website including a forum - I took a peek, looks pretty good to me!\n\nTHE VENUS PROJECT'S NEW WEBSITE\n\nWe are very happy to present our new website. Included are many new photos, multiple News items on the home page (e.g. BBC slideshow of The Venus Project narrated by Jacque Fresco), TVP Education, and TVP TV. Get Involved with our Current Projects as a Supporter, a Volunteer, or take our Mentor classes. Everything has been updated; Archives, book and documentary lists, Viral Images, FAQ, Current State of Technology, and more. How wonderful that this was all accomplished though our network of volunteers who work tirelessly to inform others of The Venus Project, a sustainable alternative to our present conditions of politics, poverty and war.\n\nhttp://www.thevenusproject.com/",
