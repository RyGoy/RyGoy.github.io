   "message": "Jean-Paul Rodrigue is a Canadian most noted (in 2008) for his \"bubble model\", charting four \"phases of a bubble\". According to the model, while the \"smart money\" has purchased during the earlier \"stealth phase\", institutional investors begin to buy during \"take off\". Following media coverage, the general public begins to invest leading to steep rise in prices as \"enthusiasm\" and then \"greed\" kick in. \"Delusion\" precedes the peak.",
