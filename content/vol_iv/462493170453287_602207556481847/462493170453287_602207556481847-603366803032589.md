   "message": "1980-1981 I attended Lewis S. Beatie Secondary School for \"Special\" Children, because the NORMAL school had 6 Commodore CBM's for 1200 students.\n\nL.S.Beatie had 30 for 300 students who couldn't successfully pick their own noses 2 times out of three.\n\n\"Mr. Cherniak\" the MATH teacher ran the computer lab and eventually ratted me out, when new and BETTER programs appeared, and he caught me making one.\n\nI was booted out after that. It turns out the kids at Northview were just as stupid, so my computer-science-itch was always covered.\n\nTrue Story!",
