   "message": "Yes, but I was busy learning English, I had no time to look at the sidewalk......the first year in The group, I was spending 6 hours of my time, 7 days a week just to try to understand what Scott Duncan was talking about.\n\nI don't make excuses, don't get me wrong, I just say what it is. And I have millions of different crypto-currenies.\n\nI was a French Quebecois dude, knowing NOTHING about LAW, Computers, Legalese, and money.\n\nOut though I NEVER was hungry, nor my children.\n\nI don't care about being multi-gazillionaire......and I am not even close to \"poor\" :P\n\nThese Articles from Scott, I still reading them everyday :/\n\nI am a dumbfuck Quebecois Lou, the ONLY reason why I might be ahead in the classroom is because I have put 5 times the time in it, and I may have bigger balls than some in here......that's all.",
