It really isn't.\n\nYou haven't got the pieces together in your heads, and you are REALLY running out of time.\n\nI am about to collapse banking and start a war, and if all of you don't have a clue when that happens, you're one of the \"bad guys\", and you deserve what you've got coming.\n\nI'm TRYING to save you, but you fiddle while Rome burns. Play if you want, but when you realize I've put out lifeboats and you try to board them, you will find out THEN that it's too late...\n\n...We will be the \"haves\", and you will be the \"have-not's\". That will be the final state, and then you serve or die. I have NO sympathy for ENABLERS.",
