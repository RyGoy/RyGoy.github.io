   "message": "So, the Fibonacci sequence is part of the algorithm?\nWith the market caps on growth, does that mean that once the cap is reached it still can be divided fractaly in reverse?  I am fascinated by the math. \nNassiem Harrimen broke everything down with a hypothesis then some elegant simple proofs in theoretical physics about infinity within a confined spherical space. Do some of those principles apply?\n What is your take on his theories and proofs?",
