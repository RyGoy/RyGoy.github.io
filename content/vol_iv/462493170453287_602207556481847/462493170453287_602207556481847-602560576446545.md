   "message": "I have to wait for everyone else to get their shit together. I am all done.\n\nMy life's work was interrupted by The courts and Government, and I actually had a contract that they would leave me the fuck alone. In the 90's they would spend hundreds of thousands to AVOID conflict with me. Now they ignore even their OWN rules.\n\nSo I keep myself busy executing their demise. (\"Idle hands\", and all. Must keep busy!) My counterparts in India, Singapore, Tokyo, New York and Germany... are a little slower. They haven't had their home stolen.",
