   "message": "\"money\" is the mirage. And its the stupidity of ignoring what it REALLY is begets the GREED which keeps everyone BELIEVING in it. \n\nIf EVERYONE, or even a quarter of us shleps realized when they work, they get paid IOU's for their time... \n\nI mean actually, if your boss was to give you a piece of paper that said \"I owe you $omething\", would that even be acceptable?\n\nBitcoin is the same but does not have rapists attached to it.",
