   "message": "The formation of the Universal Postal Union in 1874 has another legal effect that is very important to the Universal-Legal-Technology. The Universal Postal Union unites member countries into a single, worldwide postal territory. 13[13] We have already learned that any litigant is going into international jurisdiction every time he goes to any court. Since the litigant needs to establish that his papers are official, he uses a dollar???? postage stamp on the face of the first page. The stamps also invoke postal statutes and the Universal Postal Union jurisdiction. Currently in the U. S., the stamp of choice is the �fox� (discontinued 22 April 2004 or earlier) U. S. dollar postage stamp. The stamp is not drawn in a box, making the forty-five-degree lines unnecessary. The litigant does, however, need to autograph across the stamp, then date the autograph, for two reasons: to comply with postal regulations concerning private mail carriers, and to make a continuance of evidence that the process (paper work) is mail. The continuation of evidence is less of a factor, since the definitions of �mail� and �delivery� can include a clerk at a grocery store handing a customer a receipt for groceries. One can see that Standaring had his shipping clerk wired with the Bill of Lading. \n\nThe legal writers were forced to make the definitions wide enough to encompass the private rural carriers, and private advertisers that have placed advertisements on our doorsteps, or in our hands. I have thought about this issue a lot, and I did not find any other better alternative. Any loophole would have devastated many consumers, and caused a plethora of other laws to be enacted to cover the loophole. \n\nAdditionally, on the back of the first page, we authenticate the authority of the Post-Office with an endorsement, and simultaneously authenticate our identity by placing a postage meter stamp, from a postage meter machine that we have purchased in advance, on the lower quarter of the back of the first page. All commercial papers have endorsements to authenticate their authenticity. Again, we autograph across the meter stamp, and date. The postage meter stamp is better than a regular stamp, and stamps are said to have rendered seals superfluous. 14[14] The purchase of a meter machine requires identification in case the meter machine is tampered with or is stolen. The meter number on the meter stamp can be traced back to the owner (litigant), and therefore authenticates the endorser better than any seal. \n  Scott Duncan-Is this what makes the \"Buck-O-5\" Method so powerful????
