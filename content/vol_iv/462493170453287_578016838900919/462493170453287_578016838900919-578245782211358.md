   "message": "Peace and love is reserved for those we trust. The machine needs a radical redesign and the only way to achieve this is to smash the shit out of it and dump it into a deep hole where no one can recycle the good bits. There are not good bits, it all has to go the way of the dinosaur. I support the Elsipogtog nation, they have made it clear that they have tried the courts and every process left to find remedy, their only option is place their bodies on the land and defend it by all means. Those snipers the NB trustees brought in should have had an arrow shot through their throats to send a message to the RCMP, the Feds and the rest of the shit stains who collect a check from the public trust.",
