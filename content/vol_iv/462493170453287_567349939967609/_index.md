   "message": "Valuing the right thing... Not being in Jail...\n\nThe ability to Mind my own business through a Private TRUST.\n      Walk away from a traffic/harassment stop with at least 2 warrants for arrest out at present, for bullshit. \n      Me was pulled over in SERENITY in the seedy part of town, looking for weed and hookers.\n       Cop comes up to SERENITY, I read him my public notice about the Name Jason Fredrick Leblanc being TRUST Property, he cuts me off... doesn't let me finish... asks for insurance and registration which I do have... Under a separate TRUST agreement... He takes documents to Police cruiser, I write up invoice for unauthorized use of name... cop comes back with 2 tickets made out to the vehicles registered title holder... which will be new originaled and voided.... for failure to produce licence... \n     I try to hand him my invoice he sticks tickets in my hand...\n     MY Phone and I did not get along ( battery was dead, car charger has issues, managed to catch last minute or so)... only caught the officer calling me by the Name on the ticket and handing me the tickets ( I will email vid to Scott, tech difficulties on this end, for verification and to post here if it is acceptable)... \nHe did not use my name...\n     The Cop attached surety to a person not even present at the time ( separate trust). He avoided the use of the name and made a point of calling me a different name.. I did not correct him as I knew I could New Original and VOID.\n     I do not like the special beatings...\n     What I did not know was the amount of officers present....\n     As the cop turned off his emergency lights and drove away ... it was a parade... 3 paddy wagons.. 3 marked cop cars, a unmarked SUV and 2 more unmarked cars pulled out after him...\n\nI did not let them attach attach surety to me... \nfrom what I have learned here... \ndrove away and scored some weed...\nHaving tech issues with vid... have sent raw footage by email.\nJay.",
