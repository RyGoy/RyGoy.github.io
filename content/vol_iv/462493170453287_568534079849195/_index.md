   "message": "The word �person� in legal terminology is perceived as a general word which normally includes in its scope a variety of entities other than human beings. Seee.g. 1 U.S.C. sec 1. Church of Scientology v. U.S. Dept. of Justice (1979) 612F.2d 417, 425.\n\nOne of the very first of your state statutes will have a section listed entitled �Definitions. �Carefully study this section of the statutes and you will find a portion that reads similar to this excerpt:\n\nIn construing these statutes and each and every word, phrase, or part hereof, where the context will permit:\n\n(1) The singular includes the plural and vice versa.\n\n(2) Gender-specific language includes the other gender and neuter.\n\n(3) The word �person� includes individuals, children, firms, associations, joint adventures, partnerships, estates, trusts, business trusts, syndicates, fiduciaries, corporations, and all other groups or combinations.\n\nNOTE HOWEVER, THE DEFINITIONS STATUTE DOES NOT LIST MAN OR WOMAN � THEREFORE THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM ALL THE STATUTES !!!",
