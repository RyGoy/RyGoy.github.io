   "message": "Besides the default response of:  We recommend that you consult with a lawyer of your own choosing in order to be informed of your legal rights regarding this matter,\n\nI liked the hidden nugget in Q51:\n\nQ51. I have a birth certificate issued by a Canadian province; can I request that the Government of Canada pay my debts?\n\nA. The birth certificate is not a property of the Government of Canada and it is not an instrument to request payment by the Government of Canada of any Debt incurred under your name. It is an official document issued by a Provincial Government giving details of a person's birth. For any information or to voice any concerns regarding a birth certificate, please consult the Provincial Government where the birth certificate was issued.\n\nFeel free to remove the shitstain if one is created, but here's my logic:\n\nThe birth certificate is not (a) property of the Government of Canada...but it appears that they acknowledge it is a form of property.\n\nIt is an official document issued by a Provincial Government...so they are the creator and signatory/surety.\n\nSo in that instance, the Government of Canada is not surety (they didn't create and/or sign the thing, the province did), so send the BofEs to the provincial treasury cos they deal with the BofEs associated with the person...or am I reading too much into that answer? ;-)\n\nI wonder what the response would be if Qs 45 to 55 were addressed to the Provincial Department responsible for issuing the BC and/or the treasury of the province.\n\nI received a similar response from the Reserve Bank of Australia (equivalent to Bank of Canada), but the NSW Treasury have not responded to similar questions, even though most of those questions are in accordance with the Public Trustees Act of NSW (the NSW Dept of Births Deaths and Marriages issue the BC in NSW)...still more learning to do.",
