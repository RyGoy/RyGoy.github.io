   "message": "I can't find the thread where we were coming up with reasons the commonwealth died, but I had a thought  and will post it here. \n\nAt the kyoto protocol talks, there were also talks about the Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST). I quote this from a different article on LOST... \"In order to protect and govern this common heritage, the Treaty creates what is in effect a new world government ï¿½ a government of the sea. \" http://www.masterresource.org/2013/04/lost-treaty-walk-plank/\n\nIF the definition of Canada Canadian waters'' includes the territorial sea of Canada and the internal waters of Canada;(interpretations act), would this be why the commonwealth was dead...as most are defined as water so they would have to abide by this new world government created from LOST?",
