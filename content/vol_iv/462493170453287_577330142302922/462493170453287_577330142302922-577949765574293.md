But now these sneaky sonna ma mitchs, along with the help of the courts, can seek out compensation. I kid you not! Well, according to this, there is such a thing as a hurt feelings report, and it pays well, for the victims hurting the psychopaths fucking what? Image? Feelings? For making them feel isolated from family and friends? For making them feel bad for following the insane orders to cause injury to the public in the first place? I remember when one of the psychopaths who killed the Polish man in the Vancouver airport with their Tasers brought a claim against the CBC for slander or the like. \n �Due to psychiatric problems that he allegedly began suffering from after his behavior made him an Internet superstar�namely depression and anxiety.�  Isn't it attention that these psychopaths yearned for all along?                   \nhttp://rt.com/usa/uc-davis-pike-comp-641/",
