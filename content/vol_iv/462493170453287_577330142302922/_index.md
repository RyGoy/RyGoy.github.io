   "description": "COLUMBUS, OH - An 11-yr-old girl whose mother was shot and killed before her eyes in 2008 by a cop was arrested three years later for directing obscene hand gestures in the direction of cops. They charged the 11-yr-old girl with \"persistent disorderly conduct.\"\n\nOn Jan. 4, 2008, police shot and killed the girl�s peaceful mother, Tarika Wilson, 26, as she huddled with her children. They also shot and killed two dogs belonging to the family. Also shot was the girl�s 1-year-old brother. He survived.\n\nhttp://www.toledoblade.com/Courts/2013/10/11/Lawsuit-can-proceed-against-Lima-police.html#ixXUEOqe7xehEJm8.99",
