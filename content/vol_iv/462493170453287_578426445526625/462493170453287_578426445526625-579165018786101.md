   "message": "If I have learned any one thing of value, the one thing I value the most, at this time, Is to recognize that \"2+2 =4\" \nNo matter where it comes from. The trick is objectivity.  I am passionate at times and it fucks with my reason. I know enough to know enough that, things often look different after some time has passed.\nSo I also realize that we all come from different places,  Just cause I can not be of assistance to some one does not mean that I cannot learn from what paths they find. \nSo it is about me ....  and doing what I can to pay it forward, so to speak.",
