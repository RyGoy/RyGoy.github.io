   "message": "Have you read the letter Derek Moran posted in TT4L? \"The certificate certifies the registration of the birth, and nothing more. It is not a commercial instrument, a bill or a bill of exchange. It is of no legal force and effect other than providing evidence of the facts therein recorded.\" NO LEGAL FORCE? How is it then, that it is used in ALL legal transactions between man and the government? It is how children are \"legally\" registered for school. It is how every one applies for a driver's license. Are they saying none of these actions are \"legal\"? If they are so legally useless, why even have one?",
