   "message": "They \"spend\" it by making new rules to enforce, for your \"safety\".\n\n...and if any get charged, they get off, or they get a slap on the wrist.\n\nKill the child of a lawyer or a fake \"sheriff\" or any other stranger acting under \"authority\" a few times, and see how much of a price they are willing top pay personally to have this \"authority\".\n\nNONE of you chose this, but they act like you did. They PRESUME you did. They think its their RIGHT to harm you.\n\n...so THEREFORE you can kill their children under the same \"authority\". After all, we're all equal under the law.\n\nAs their child bleeds out in front of them, be sure to offer them comforting words like \"I'm just doing my job\", \"there was a court order\", \"it's all perfectly legal\", and of course \"That's what you get for ignoring authority\".",
