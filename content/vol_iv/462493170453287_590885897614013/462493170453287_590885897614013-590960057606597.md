   "message": "If you choose to use a hatchet on their children, be sure to say \"I'm just following orders\" to the beat of your blows.\n\nNow I know there are some government prudes reading this and thinking \"I don't care how much we fucked you over, you don't target kids\"!\n\nWell you don't care how much you fucked me over NOW, so I don't care if you are begging for your child's life. I just don't.\n\nIf we're going to be treated like violent criminals, we might as well get the benefit of being violent criminals!\n\nI'm not one of you freeloaders who don't want to pay their mortgage.\n\nI'm not one of these people who don't pay their taxes.\n\nI'm someone a scuzzball lawyer stole from and the courts and cops protected.\n\nMartin Sutton witnessed this happening. He even got the fake transcripts to my case and compared them to the video footage! I even showed where to go to press charges...\n\nNothing. Nothing gets done. You all talk a pretty tale, and cling to bullshit.\n\nSO, from this day forward, when you ask what to do, my answer is:\nPick a lawyer. Kill their child.\nPick a cop. Kill their child.\nPick a Government worker (Corrections officers are a good worthy choice, being zookeepers/kidnappers, and all). Kill their kid.\n\nIf you could video it for me, I'd REALLY appreciate it.\n\n...",
