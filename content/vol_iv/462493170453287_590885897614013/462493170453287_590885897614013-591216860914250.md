   "message": "This is where it begins to become fun & interesting...\n\nA 'claim' is brought against the name & delivered to me...it is unsubstantiated...my counterclaim may include the following:\n\n1.  A conditional acceptance of the claim/charge upon proof of the claim they are bringing.\n2.  An administrative fee for having to respond & clarify that they have not made an error.\n3.  A further administrative fee for having to point out the errors & false presumptions they have made when presenting the claim.\n4.  A hefty administration fee for having to clean up the shitstain of bringing a false claim against my good character.\n\nThey used the word 'you', not me :D\n\nAfter all, I'm an honourable & honest man & take these allegations VERY seriously & an unsubstantiated claim would be an attempt to cause me harm.\n\nHarm for which I mean to seek remedy...on my terms, privately.\n\nThe end result is either a lien or a check/cheque into an account that I nominate...not me, me doesn't have an account, so me may nominate the account of another person. (credit to Pete Daoust for the 'me' references :D )\n\nI think I'm learning to be a very good administrator & collect a fee for clearing up administrative errors :D",
