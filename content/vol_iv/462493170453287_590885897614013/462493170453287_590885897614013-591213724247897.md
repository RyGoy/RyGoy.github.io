   "message": "Thankfully, this is a two way process, for example, when a promissory note is accepted in exchange for a loan & the promissory note is then claimed by the 'lender' as their own, they  have just claimed property that is not theirs, for their own benefit & we have the right to claim the value of the note back.\n\nThe worm is turning :D",
