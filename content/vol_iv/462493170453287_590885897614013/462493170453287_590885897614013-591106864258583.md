   "message": "Hmmm.\n\n       Chris Evan if it's all about accounting and surety and you know zip about accounting, \nHow are you going to Benefit?\n      The irony of Scott's killing comments all through out this Forum.  Has just hit me...\nWhen the Admiral speaks, One does his best to listen.\n ( speaks = articles, comments, observations, banning and or other means, always, unless not, a metaphor for these means of communication)\n I would like to draw your ( not scott and or others more advanced)  attention to a couple of things that have affected me.\nUnderstanding has been slow for me.\nContrary to popular belief, I am not really a bumbler...\ni am prudent in this area of my life. I went out and did a couple things straight off when I got here.\nI formed a corp, liened the ALL CAPS name and then \ntended to my vessel.   I have seen first hand some scary shit. One thing always bothered me, nagged at me, Mr.Frisbey expressed it one of the posts about killing children...\n Got to admit, I stayed quiet, I knew I was missing the point, somehow... I carried on with my life.\nIt is a very clever tool. It has taught me about layers and multiple levels of meaning in even the simplest of terms, especially the simplest.\nIt has made me one who rebuts almost everything that is not correct about my circumstances.\nIt also cemented, what I think is the first small part of the foundation to which this is leading. I am creative so it is an adventure after all. Now to finance it.\nWords to convey the enormity of this gift ( free) elude me.",
