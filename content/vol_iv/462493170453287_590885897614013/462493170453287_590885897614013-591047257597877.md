   "message": "In some ways it depends what you want to do with the Lien Pete Daoust...\n\nIf you want to collect on it, then it probably doesn't matter whether you do it in your personal capacity or through a corporation.\n\nIf the person you keep in your pocket or in your truck is held/been liened into the private trust held by the corporation you are the sole shareholder of, then the trustee would be making a claim on behalf of the trust...because the person is now trust property.\n\nAs soon as the lien is perfected, the value of the lien is an asset in the corporation you are sole shareholder of.\n\nFor example, you lien the person in your pocket (into the private trust) for $2.5 Million...the value of the trust has increased in value by $2.5 Million...this goes into the asset column of the corporation holding the trust & hey presto, the book value of the corporation has just increased by $2.5 Million.\n\nThe corporation can now show the company books to say, a bank & borrow maybe $250 000.00 against the asset value ($2.5 Million) of the corporation.\n\nYou now have $250 000.00 in money of exchange that you can use to do business with, by converting money of account into money of exchange, pretty much out of thin air.\n\nYou can return the loaned funds at some future time or just surrender the $2.5 Million lien as collateral for the loan & keep the $250 000 cash...(but you would probably want to keep and control the lien of the person in your pocket).\n\nHowever, IF you have a perfected lien against say, a public servant that attempted to harm/cause damage to trust property, and you surrendered the lien to a bank, you keep the cash, the bank can onsell the lien OR collect on it because they are the holder in due course...and they can wield a lot more power & cause a lot more damage to the person than you, and you have the benefit of converting the money of exchange into bitcoins for Fucks the Puppy's wallet :D\n\nPlease feel free to correct any errors Scott Duncan, either in principle or terminology, for entertainment purposes only...",
