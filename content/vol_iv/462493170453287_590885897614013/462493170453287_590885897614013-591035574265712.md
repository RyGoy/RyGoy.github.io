   "message": "On one level I'm getting this...\n\nIf a liened person held within a private trust gets harmed by a/any public servant(s) or have been harmed by any public servant(s), remedy may be sought by causing them a civil death...lien the person into the private trust...lien their chattel property (children) as well, because they are, at least in the state's eyes/clubhouse rules, a product of the person/parent entity...it would be a duty of the trustee(s) of a private trust to secure remedy against any entity causing harm or extracting value/making a false claim against trust property...so factually, the trustee is absolutely 'just doing my job'. :D \n\nBy doing so, money of account has been created to the value of the lien(s) and can be marked in the asset column of the corporation holding the private trust.\n\nThat book value/money of account may then be deposited/transferred onto Roguesupport Inc's books, or some other corporate entity, for their use of say, creating a bank or other such business activity, which is none of my business, in much the same way as it's none of my business what any bank does with the funds once they are deposited.\n\nThe only requirement being that the book value of the deposited assets is available to be returned, upon request, at some mutually agreed future date.\n\n...wow!! :D ...but for entertainment purposes only, of course...",
