   "message": "Bobis Youruncle: Proceeds of crime = Forfeiture of property. \nLoss of title. \n\nJust musing out loud on this principle, but this sounds like the way we became liable...we claimed the name was us/our property without providing proper notice (ie: something that didn't belong to us)...consequently, any property held in the name is/became stolen property and/or proceeds of crime, or at least negligence on our part, a gross negligence & subsequently fraud...crime.\n\nSimilarly, using the debt notes/currency of a foreign entity, we are again taking what is not ours & using it for our benefit & consequently must accept their terms of use (statutes etc).\n\nEither way, in our ignorance (ignorance of the law being no excuse) we consequently run the risk of forfeiture of all property to the creator of the person & becoming subject to arrest and/or detention for these actions...what a stitch up, Machiavelli would be impressed!\n\nInstead of seizing ALL the property (proceeds of crime) & detaining all of the criminals, which would be very expensive for the state...we become subject to various episodes of bloodletting (fines, taxes, licence fees etc), much in the same way a farmer milks a cow.\n\nI have always wondered why identity theft is not considered, in and of itself, a crime...because when we claim an identity (that we did not create and did not provide proper notice), we are in effect committing identity theft.",
