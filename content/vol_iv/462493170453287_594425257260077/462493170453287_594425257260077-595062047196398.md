   "message": "I have a theory for this....back then (before 1868 in the States), all family business was handled through a Private Trust (Nation) in which the Husband would hold.  Therefore, a woman had no standing (as she couldn't...she wasn't a person) and should go through the husband/trust.  If you think about it, it makes sense.....every family would be their own sovereign nation and the public trustees would have one point of contact per nation.  \n\nI think when they issued Persons and gave women \"personhood\", everything got screwed up.  \n\nThat being said, I have no problem with a man or a woman holding a trust...I just think it was how they did it back then.  I also think this is part of the solution going forward.  This is pretty much what Scott did and taught us how to do.  \n\nAlso too...remember, in law, the masculine means the feminine as well.\n\n\"As lunatics\" could perhaps mean that they were speaking when they had a superior claim and \"sold out\" to have their voice heard.  Like Dean Clifford says \"You get the government you deserve\"...in my opinion in this case, personhood.",
