   "message": "Last Monday, I swore out an Affidavit with an Exhibit A (Notice of Mistake) and Exhibit B (Birth Certificate) and entered it into the court file.  When it was \"my turn\", the Judge looked at me and said \"Do you have anything to add to this motion?\"  I said \"It is sworn testimony in the form of an Affidavit, it is not a motion.\" He said \"I am treating it as a motion.\" I said \"Then you would be treating it wrong.\"  He said \"Motion denied.\"\n\nScott, what would you have done in this situation?",
