   "message": "What do you mean Rick?  I sent Affidavit/Notice of Mistake/Birth Certificate.  They issued an Arrest warrant.  I issued another Notice of Mistake in response to the Arrest Warrant.  They executed the Arrest Warrant.  I went to court in cuffs that afternoon and started asking who the Surety was.  They locked me up, stifled me, proceeded, etc.  What did I do wrong?  Why wouldn't they just do this all over again if I, the man, don't go?  \n\nI am thinking going there as BENEFICIARY and standing up to them is the best idea, but please.....offer a better idea.  I NEVER tried to deal with these idiots on the side of the road, I NEVER answered to the NAME!",
