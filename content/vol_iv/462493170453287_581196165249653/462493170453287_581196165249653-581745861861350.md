   "message": "My question about \"friend of the court\" came as an idea (from deep within my rectum) to compliment the NoM, when \"they\" seem to ignore it. \n\nI thought that if a \"friend of the court\" is WITNESS to \"fraud upon the court\", by letting the court know that he/she has PROOF (a certified copy of the previous documents filed on the record, Affidavit with NoM and BC as Exhibits) that surety, and the legal name derived from public documents are been MISTAKENLY applied to a MAN, perhaps Chris, or others in the same situation, could get more meat on their side to have \"them\" OBEY the RULE OF LAW. \n\nBut again, that is something I pulled out of my ass, I have no idea if it's possible, or even appropriate.",
