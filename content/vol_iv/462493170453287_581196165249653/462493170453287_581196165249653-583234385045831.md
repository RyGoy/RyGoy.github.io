Take NOTICE that YOU administrated the person, CHRISTOPHER EVAN SCHULTE, by accepting an Affidavit as a Motion in open Court, and thereby took a statement of FACTS and used it as an APPLICATION.  IT SCARES ME TO DEATH to think that you think you have the power to change the INTENT of MY CREATION (the BENEFICIARY) in a Public Venue with the apparent intent to corner ME into playing the role of SURETY!  This gives ME good reasons to believe that you administrated this WITHOUT authorization.  In FACT, I am the Sole BENEFICIARY for CHRISTOPHER EVAN SCHULTE and I have NOT given you any AUTHORIZATION.  Witnessing that act gives me good reasons to believe that you are the SURETY and TRUSTEE in this matter.  \n\nAre you trying to commit FRAUD by cornering me into a fraudulent usufructory agreement under the threat of false arrest and false imprisonment under the Color of Law?\n\nThank you for acting as TRUSTEE, SURETY, and ADMINISTRATOR in this matter.\n\nChris\nBENEFICIARY\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\nNON NEGOTIABLE\n\nPS�..If ANYTHING stated is not true, you may send a sworn statement of FACTS under the pains of penalty and perjury via registered mail to Chris at 300 Andover Street, Suite 120, Peabody, Massachusetts within 5 days.  All statements not rebutted shall be considered FACT.",
