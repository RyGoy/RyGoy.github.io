Thanks! \n\nI know \"friends of the court\" INFORM. \n\nWhat if a \"friend of the court\" has seen PROOF, that a living man is been MISTAKEN for a NAME? I would think is a DUTY to INFORM the court, perhaps via SWORN NOTICE in form of an Affidavit, of such terrible MISTAKE. \n\nIs this a real possibility, Scott Duncan, or should I put all that back into my ass?",
