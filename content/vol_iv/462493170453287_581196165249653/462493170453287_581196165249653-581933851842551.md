   "message": "Modified:\n\nNOTICE AND DEMAND \n 11/1/13\nTo: Presiding Justice, Honorable Robert A Brennan\nFrom: Chris\n\nCertified Mail #\n\nHello Mister Brennan, \n\nOn October 22, 2013, an Affidavit was submitted into a Court File for a Case in involving CHRISTOHER EVAN SCHULTE.  I would like to point out that YOU decided to administrate the person CHRISTOPHER EVAN SCHULTE by turning an Affidavit into a Motion, thereby took a statement of FACTS and converted it into an APPLICATION.  I have good reasons to believe that you have done so WITHOUT authorization.  In FACT, I am the Sole Authorized Administrator for CHRISTOPHER EVAN SCHULTE.  I didn�t create it, I never asked for it, but somehow I became the lawful holder in due course of it, so I am doing my best.  \n\nIT SCARES ME TO DEATH to think that you have the power to change the INTENT of MY CREATION in an effort to corner ME into playing the role of SURETY!  I, a living man, created a declaration of facts and you changed it!  What is going on here?  Am I some kind of a SLAVE?  Why should I bother stepping into a courtroom ever again if you are going to FUCK around with my FREEDOMS?  I can only presume that my SWORN TESTIMONY and intent are not valid in your courtroom, thereby, I, the man, MUST have no business there.  \n\nThis has given ME good reasons to believe that you fully accepted SURETY in this matter, so as the BENEFICIARY (which is really the only role I can possibly be), I will wait for my check, and let you do the administration, until this matter is completed.\n\nOh, and for good measure, you can also find the Affidavit in this communication along with 2 EXHIBITS. \n\nChris can only accept Registered Mail for this communication.\n\nFailure to respond within 5 days to the questions contained in this communication and rebut ANYTHING that isn�t a FACT shall indicate acquiescence of ALL the terms and conditions indicated within the communication.  \n\nThank you, \n\nChris \nPS�..I, the living man, am not SURETY for this Account.  Would you care to swear under the pains of penalty and perjury that I am???",
