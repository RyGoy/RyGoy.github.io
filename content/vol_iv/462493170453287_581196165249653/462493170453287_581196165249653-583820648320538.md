   "message": "Road side cop talk is a waste of time. The last time I was pulled over, I asked 3 or 4 questions only to have the pig reply \"Sounds like you wanna argue\" I just replied \"I'm not gonna argue with some guy packin' a 9mm strapped to his fuckin' hip, do whatcha gotta do\" then I shut the fuck up and jumped in the tow truck towing my car away. Point of the story is, pick your battles wisely. These fucking programmed clowns think they have all kinds of authority and it's a waste of time even trying to communicate with them. Save that shit for your paperwork.",
