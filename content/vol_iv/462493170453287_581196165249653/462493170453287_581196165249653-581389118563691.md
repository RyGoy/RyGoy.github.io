   "message": "I have a couple of questions.  I may be in the same situation as Chris and I'd like some suggestions on how to respond.  If the courts have received my NoM, affidavit and bc, but the warrant is still out their for my arrest, what should I do now?  How should I respond if the police come after me again?  How should I respond if I'm in public , at the airport, or on the side of the road and the police are attempting to handcuff me even though these documents have been submitted into the courts but the account has not been settled?  Is there something else I should do to settle this matter without appearing in court?",
