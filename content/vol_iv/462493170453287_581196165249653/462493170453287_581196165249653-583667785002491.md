   "message": "You MADE statements in court=YOU ARE A SLAVE arguing/in dishonor IN OPEN PUBLIC COURT\n\nFOR FUCK SAKES � STOP MAKING STATEMENTS AND/OR ANSWERING QUESTIONS  WHEN SPEAKING TO THE PUBLIC SCUMBAGS, reserve what you wanna assert for your affidavits/notices\n\nAs for your notice - you will get no response, for several reasons. You can send whatever you want - just be prepared to STAND behind what you choose to send. \n\nSTAND=ASKING FOR PROOF OF CLAIM THAT WHATEVER YOU ASSERT IS NOT SO - incidentally, while making NO statements, answering NO questions and ONLY ASKING questions.\n\nPersonally, I�d file the notice/affidavit and go about my life as usual. Fuck those clowns, these �public servants� are only there to fuck you in the ass and refuse to acknowledge anything that wasn�t written by �one of the club�. If they arrest you, just remember you�re the beneficiary of the trust/secured party creditor for the defendant, whatever.. Is the birth certificate NOT a security? Is it not MY security? Is the security/birth certificate not PROOF of the FACT that I AM the beneficiary? Are you not a public servant and thus a public TRUSTEE? What would the minister of justice think of your fraudulent actions? \nAnyway, you are NOT the trustee/defendant so they cannot hold you forever. Keep asking for proof of claim with questions. Are you suggesting that using a driver�s license turns ME into a fictional character? Is the juristic person NOT a fictional character created by the government? Can you please explain what the fuck, YOU, a PUBLIC TRUSTEE, is doing perpetrating fraud against an honest to goodness beneficiary like me?... \n\nFor those of you who insist on making statements in court/questioning/taking to cops/other agents � remember:\n \nDepose: The term is usually applied to the deprivation of ALL authority of a sovereign.\n\nOk, I�m done now� ;)",
