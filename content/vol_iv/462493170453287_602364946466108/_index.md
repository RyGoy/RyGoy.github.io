   "message": "Scott Duncan\nTHIS, is a TENDER FOR LAW.\n\nLet's look at the LEGAL aspects of this. (Legal=Commerce)\nCommerce. You sell TRUST, for FIAT CURRENCY? REALLY?\n\nThis is where the term \"sold out\" came from. The 13 Colonies spawned the term. EVERYONE knew who they were and they understood Jurisdiction. It's why they left the Banker's dominion called \"Europe\" behind.\n\nTRUST LAW IS THE HIGHEST LAW\n\nDON'T SELL ITS VALUE TO LOWER LAW!",
