   "message": "Libby Patterson As I understand, you only get that sort of \"intel\" with the death certificate and a Last Will and Testament naming you the/an executor. Your mother's WILL may have been written with the help of someone loyal to the bar (not to your mother or her children/named beneficiaries) and notarized UNDER the seal of a \"superior\" provincial court. It is likely your mother is never mentioned in \"her\" will. I suspect that such a document will only refer to the PERSON your mother used, although you would see her signature allowing the \"ATTORNey\" to ATTORN everything to a corporation. You probably won't be named. The PERSON you use might be though. Hope that was some help. Hate to hear about your loss and give you that NEWS. :( Did  I do okay Scott Duncan?",
