   "message": "Look Right...Look Left...No Smoking...No Running...No Loitering...Mind The Gap...\n\nYou can�t trip over your own shoelaces in this country without breaking a law or rule of some description. Every decision seems to offend the sensibilities of one group or another. And at every turn, every juncture, there�s a nosy official waiting to tell you what you should or should not be doing. They sneak out from behind telephone booths, they cross the street to correct your every move. A tsk-tsk here, a tut-tut there. A wag of the finger is never more than a minor public infraction away.\n\nBut just try asking them Why? or Why Not? and you�ll draw a stare as blank as a politician�s conscience. Then, after a long and confused silence, they�ll remember the appropriate response to such questions of authority. And they�ll recite, blindly, from some deep, dark place in their unquestioning little brains, �Because that�s the law.�",
