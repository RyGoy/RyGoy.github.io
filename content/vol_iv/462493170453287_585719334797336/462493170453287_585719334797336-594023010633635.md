   "message": "Thank you, Beverly. Nevertheless, it is handy to have to ensure we get the paper-work correct. Clerks of the Courts/Registrars, here, are known to just reject documents for filing, but do not return them to the author/originator ...most likely they shred them ... consequently, Magistrates don't see them, leaving the accused/defendant sitting in court like a 'shag on a rock'.",
