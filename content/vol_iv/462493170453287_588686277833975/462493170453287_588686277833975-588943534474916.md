   "message": "I find it very curious to brand atheists as devil worshippers...\n\nBy definition, if you are a christian (of whatever extraction), you believe in the existence of a devil figure/anti christ/satan figure...the two characters are codependent.\n\nA-theism means exactly that...no deity worship of any form...a total lack of belief in a god, a devil, a holy virgin who got raped in her sleep or any of the other characters in the story...devil worshipping, by its very name, suggests some sort of theistic belief...in this case, a devil.\n\nJust as believing in Luke Skywalker, Yoda, Darth Vader or Han Solo is ridiculous, because the entire Star Wars story is fiction/fantasy, how can belief in any of the Biblical characters, good or bad be rational when they too are all fiction/fantasy?!?\n\nBut Star Trek, that's a different story...that shit is real :P",
