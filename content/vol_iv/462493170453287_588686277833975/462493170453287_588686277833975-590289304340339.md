   "message": "Scott Duncan Stuart Stone: Refer to my \"Insurance For Idiots\" article:\n\n'In order to completely remove surety (insure) another PERSON must take responsibility for your actions. This concept is in fact, FRAUD.'\n\n'This is one of many uses for the Abrahamic religions. They socially-engineer concepts like INSURANCE so they are elevated from blatant unethical FRAUD to a necessity for daily life, and they will say you are foolish, or a bad person, for not having INSURANCE.'\n\nAnd they can act all virtuous & holier than thou while they screw us over/defraud us...got it, thank you Scott Duncan.",
