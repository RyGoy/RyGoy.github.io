   "message": "A bit off topic, but ties in with the whole Jesus Schtick:\n\nIf Jesus was a zombie rape baby...and Mary was not 'married' to God, making Jesus a baby out of wedlock, in the law's eyes is he not considered a bastard?\n\nIt is my understanding that a bastard child cannot inherit the estate of the father,  (I remember that from a maxim somewhere but cannot locate it:  something like, a child born from wedlock takes the condition/name of the father, a child born out of wedlock takes the condition of the mother).\n\nFrom this, how can Jesus possibly die/have an inconvenienced weekend for our sins, when he's automatically excluded from his father's will by virtue of his bastard status?\n\nHe's not a rightful heir...\n\nHow can we be forgiven our debts when the actions of  Jesus the bastard zombie rape baby have no bearing on the estate/earth?\n\nOr is this another of those examples of God working in mysterious ways ;-)",
