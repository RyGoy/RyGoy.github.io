   "message": "Scott on the mindset of those who get PAID BY US to HARM US and see NO PROBLEM with that 'mini-article'...\n\nREMEMBER; We�re all supposedly �equal under the law�, but reality doesn�t seem to play that out exactly. It seems everyone is ok with their rights and liberties violated by those holding the public trust. All they do to justify that is spout weasel-word catch phrases:\n\n�There is a court ORDER� (It doesn�t matter if there IS. It just has to be �believed�)\n\n�I�m just doing my job�\n\n�It�s all perfectly legal�\n\nSo, all of us being equal under the law, does that mean you, the average man/woman can use the same bullshit excuses?\n\nNO?\n\nWhy not? It�s not like anyone is ever called to account for this shit. Those that do, get �paid leave�.\n\nWhen do we get what we�ve paid for?\n\nNever, of course.\n\nThis was done in Nazi Germany in the early 30�s. There was a free press, LGBT advocacy, and over 30 Publishers that reached over 50,000 subscribers. As rights declined, the �citizens� noticed and started speaking up. The response was a more aggressive authoritarian policy, where violence against citizens was commonplace. Finally, when people started fighting back, it was merely used as an excuse for even MORE restrictions, and the �Authorities� were even MORE blatant�\n\n...and you know what happens THEN.\n\nAt NO time in history has �Protesting� EVER worked. Stop thinking that�s the answer. It isn�t. They don�t care how �peaceful� you are. You are just noisy cattle to them. People work for the government because they can�t get a job in the real world, and because they get PAID (It USED to be a PRIVILEGE and an HONOUR to hold these positions) they actually consider you �less� than them, and that they are entitled to harm those people who pay their salaries INVOLUNTARILY. REMEMBER, EVERY CENT A COP MAKES WAS TAKEN BY FORCE FROM YOU. Since they got away with that, they feel it�s their �right� to deny you your rights.\n\nThis is happening RIGHT NOW, and nobody notices, or cares.\n\nStop �protesting�! To do so, BY DEFAULT, acknowledges their �Authority� and they are trying to get you to �fight back� in a REAL way so they can take the rest of your freedoms away.\nWar is coming. Get used to �change�... and not the good kind.",
