   "message": "I don't know about the rest of you, but Scott Duncan's scariest thing is his questions. The latest example is when he asked \"Why is it so easy to find these examples\"?\n\nI went to see how many I could find, and it's like an endless stream, going back years. It terrifies me what I miss, even though it's happening in front of me. Scott terrifies me for what he can see, that the rest of us don't.\n\nOver 35 years have passed, and Scott keeps pointing out things that should be obvious, via his terrifying questions. :(",
