   "message": "I stumbled upon Robert Menard, Dean Clifford doing research into the legal process. To take care of myself. I have lived without credit and by trade, barter, contract most of my life.. \nalong with ventures into those things called \"jobs\" which don't fit me... Went to work in film where discipline is tight on set... just like a ship :-D\n   Having immersed myself in DE-programming myself once I figured out I was being lied to... My whole life, by misinformed, misguided and well intentioned individuals, who valued wrong...\nIt was just at the tip of things... \nI still had a hankering something wasn't right and it eluded me until the Admiral's Bitch slapped me on Dean's page and then I asked some questions and was invited here.  \nThe rest has been like described so well by Stuart Stone. I too am engaged in critical thinking and investigating shit to see where the flaws and the nuggets are, cause some sources have lies sandwiched between truths and none of these fuckers talk about the legal tender...",
