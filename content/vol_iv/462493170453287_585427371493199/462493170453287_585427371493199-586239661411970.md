   "message": "Ok, I just finished watching all of the \"unraveled\" video series. I had to smoke a ton of weed, and have good unprotected sex to detox from all the God/Bible \"program\" he uses. \n\nMarcus REALLY believes in God, Jesus, Satan, satanist running the nations of men, and the Bible.  He also believes the Bible is the word of God himself, the ROYAL LAW that we must follow/agree with, and contains in itself the solution to regain our Birthright, and be free from  the bondage to Satan/Nations/States, by way of asking God for forgiveness and going back to his covenant, having a \"civil death,\" \"burning\" all contracts with the State, and not use their copyrighted name. Thus, regaining DOMINION over God's inheritance, our right to property, and other good stuff. (But he advises to look for a good copy translation of the Bible... you don't want to get even one word wrong... one word can change the whole meaning... I guess he really trust publishers...) He also hates the theory of Evolution, for it's main purpose is to bury God, and bury the knowledge that we are entitled to land, and our Birthright.\n\nHow can anyone have so many things right, but for the wrong reasons?\n\nHe knows the idea of government by men is delusional, he says believe is a bad thing and does not stand to knowledge, he is right about paying attention to words, about AUTHOR, INTENT, CAPACITY while in court, avoiding contracts with these criminal enterprises, not acting as the name, the we are \"the face of God\"  (we are supreme) and many other things that are true, but for the wrong reasons.\n\nIt's a somehow disappointing feeling.",
