   "message": "Thank you.\n\nThe 'Why' probably falls into the category of my previously listening to 'gurus', without using a constructive/critical approach:  \n\neg: Rob Menard initially...to paraphrase:  You're free you're free, the system is evil, but give me some cash & let's drink some beer.\n\nI knew something wasn't quite right but couldn't work it out for myself: ie: a lack of understanding of what 'this note is legal tender' means & the consequences of still being tied to the dependence on legal tender (I'm out of the system but I still rely on it...which translates as I'm not really out of the system after all).\n\nGood intent but harmful outcomes/results.\n\nDean Clifford: trying to fix the system from within, by relying upon their own rules & assuming they will act with honour & integrity.  I'm finally beginning to grasp the concept of the system being broken beyond repair & I greatly appreciate the way Dean acts in honour & his integrity in trying to help change the system for the better.\n\nHowever, when they don't adhere to their own rules, we've got no chance and can't do much if we're in a cage.  So, although he has a big set of balls, the divestment approach & starving the hand that beats us probably has a lot more merit to it...until they get (more) desperate.\n\nThere is no disrespect intended toward either of these men (actually a great deal of respect & admiration) as I have learnt from both in comprehending what they teach & from observing some of the results.\n\nThen there's the remove myself from Commerce & pity the dumb bastard that tries to cause me harm approach.  I realise this is only the tip of the iceberg, but my comprehension is expanding.\n\nThis has caused a huge paradigm shift for me:\nTo opt out & remove myself means becoming self reliant (or having a network that is interdependent & self reliant), for energy, food & currency just to name a few.\n\nTo learn how to use the 'tools' of protection effectively (liening the name, corporate & trust structure etc) as well as extract value from the pirates, and how to navigate in the system while getting organised & prepared to get out.\n\nThe biggest part of this shift is learning how to think effectively.  The 'You all think wrong & value the wrong things' quote couldn't be more true.\n\nI am currently in the situation of recovering the 'value' from the original notes of indebtedness I signed in relation to a couple of mortgages.  Consequently, I need to have some comprehension of 'clubhouse rules' & procedure.  The other party is in default & have not responded to my affidavit. I'm in the process of getting a default judgement (UK).\n\nMy main concern is how to ensure that the court adheres to its own procedures so that I achieve the result I require...and what to do if I don't get my desired result.\n\nThis is largely why listening to lessons from those that still interact within that system (or are more familiar with that system) is useful to me.",
