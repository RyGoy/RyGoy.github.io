   "message": "The God shit is pretty heavy & tiresome.  I was not aware of the extent of this prior to posting this thread & beginning to listen to the program.  However, he arrives at some of the same conclusions:\n\nYou are the Creator.\n\nYou can't serve their 'laws' & your own.\n\nI don't know if he is a hardcore theist (sounds that way on the surface) but he makes an interesting premise: \n \nIt doesn't matter whether you believe (there's that word again) in 'God' or not, it is what their system is based around, so use their systems to your own advantage.  (this may be an example of highly flawed thinking on my part)\n\nYou can't serve two masters (ie: their laws & your own).\n\nBy claiming what is not yours (he hasn't said it (yet), but I'm guessing he is referring to the name and/or BC), you caused/created your own problems/slavery.\n\nI am listening through this program for 4 main reasons:\n\n1.  To develop my critical thinking & reasoning (eg: to see if I can recognise errors of  omission wrapped up in truths/half truths)\n2.  To determine if there are any useful practical applications\n3.  To find out if this is an opt out (defensive) approach, and/or a lien the fuck out of it approach (strong defence mixed with a strong offence).\n4.  To determine if this is (another) example of me thinking wrong & valuing the wrong things.\n\nGeneral invitation: Feel free to pull apart & expose the holes in my thinking (I realise that there is a strong possibility that I DON'T think :P ).   This is a learning process & sometime the biggest lessons are learnt from mistakes.",
