   "message": "Remittance advices thread.\n\nA few brand spanking new ADMINISTRATOR seems to be confused with this STEP, as far as administrating DEBTS. I may be confused as well, feel free to de-confuse me if it�s the case.\n\nThe way I see it is pretty simple (How else could it be :D )\n\nWhen I pick up a Bill of Exchange in PIERRE DAOUST�s mailbox, this PIERRE DAOUST that was created exactly 16 days after I showed up, I need to take care of it�..right now.\n\nSo, the ONLY method I was taught, by the MAJORITY, was to BUY BACK these debts, in fact, I believed that I WAS this person named PIERRE DAOUST, so I was picking this BoE in MY mailbox, I was sure that BoE was for ME, so I was BUYING BACK this debt on the spot, and was sending MONEY of account, or Money of exchange to the BENEFICIARY.\n\nBut Now, when I pick up those BoE, I KNOW they are addressed to a PERSON that was created 16 days after me, and I know it�s a debt, or I can even call it a THING, and I know there is more than one way to REMIT that thing.\n\nBut since I am NOT alone in this, I can ASK the beneficiary to HELP me with this.\n\nSo I do ask, I just send a small letter to the beneficiary with the following.\n\n1). I Received the debt you�ve sent to the person I happen to have in my pocket (PIERRE DAOUST)\n\n2). I am the Sole authorized administrator for that person.\n\n3). I WISH you could reveal or disclose ALL methods available to ME, to administrate this debt you�ve just sent to PIERRE DAOUST.\n\n4). You have 30 days to send ME all available methods, or I will have to use the method I am aware of, and you will have to ACCEPT that LEGAL method :P\n\nYour�s Truly :D\n\nBY:_________________________\nSole authorized Administrator for PIERRE DAOUST blab la bla\n\nThis step is a MUST, I think, because it gives the opportunity to the beneficiary to tell you the TRUTH, which is a very nice GIFT you make to them :D\n\nAnd all you have to do is WAIT for them to tell you the truth��good luck !!! :D\n\nIs that freaking simple or what ??? :D",
