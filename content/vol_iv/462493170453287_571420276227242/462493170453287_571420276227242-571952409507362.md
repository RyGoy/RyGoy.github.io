   "message": "Very interesting. Looking closely at the picture it looks like the horse is attacking the officer and the penis seems photoshopped in. It takes a LOT of abuse/cornering for a horse (unless it is a stallion) to attack. The penis, added or not, gives the photo a certain humor that would otherwise be a very sad circumstance for a horse.",
