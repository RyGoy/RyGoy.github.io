   "message": "Want to help your country and your fellow humans? Kill a lawyer. They don't actually DO anything, and harm strangers for a living. For every lawyer that dies, THOUSANDS of people will be spared victimization.\n\nDEAD LAWYERS = FREEDOM. The more dead lawyers, the greater the freedom. Know WHO to kill when violence becomes the only option... and it will. I just have to wait.\n\nNobody cared about dead Gestapo Officers in 1944. Nobody will care about dead cops, in the same way... When you see that happening, start killing lawyers. You will be speeding up the war. The less blood the better. Just make sure the right people bleed.",
