   "message": "Yes they are, because it NOT a \"fight\". It's a scam. The only \"winners\" are the lawyers.\n\nTell me about their \"successes\"! :D\n\n...and OF COURSE they did it Pro Bono! They're GOOD scam-artists! *ahem* I mean lawyers.\n\n/sarcasm\n\nI answered your question you stupid cunt! I'll say it again, without the fucking sugar-coat: YOU AGREED TO IT. YOUR \"GOOD\" FUCKING LAWYER SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT!\n\nTHERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO BECAUSE YOU CONSENTED> THE END.\n\n...why don't you go to a \"Good\" lawyer, instead of bothering me, if you don't like reality?   ...and it IS reality, no matter WHAT you believe.",
