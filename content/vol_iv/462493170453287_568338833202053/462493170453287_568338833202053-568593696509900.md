   "message": "It's the whole passive aggressive thing...\n\nAsk a question, don't like the answer (eg: make changes in your life, take responsibility, learn something etc), become manipulative and/or aggressive & keep pushing emotional buttons until an assertive and/or emotional response (or what can be perceived as one) is received...\n\nThen justify your own shortcomings by projecting them onto the other party...rinse & repeat until they lose their rag & then end it with something profound like:\n\nSee?  I told you he was a dick!... I used to be a bartender & saw that shit play out all the time...along with other assorted attention seeking behaviours\n\nMaybe it should fall under a wikipedia topic such as 'tard logic' ;-)",
