   "message": "In some ways I would agree LaNi Black, except for a couple of things:\n\n'New' members or maybe just people used to having answers spoon fed are doing themselves no favours because they aren't doing the hard yards, reading, researching, studying etc to find the hard answers to difficult questions, to break down old programming etc etc\n\nTo come on here expecting a cookie cutter, '5 minutes of effort & all my problems will be solved' is not only irresponsible, but dangerous.\n\nIt's a house, not a parking fine...there's a lot more at stake...it's worth a lot of energy n study to gain some real comprehension of what's going on.\n\nIf this person was serious, they'd take the wake up call on the chin, suck it up & spend the next 10, 20, 30 hours reading, studying & catching up on the required viewing, then maybe come back & re-examine what was said & why instead of going with the obvious knee jerk response.\n\nThat kind of over emotional response gets cops with itchy trigger fingers VEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERY excited...and nothing good ever comes out of that situation...unless the national kick a cop in the face day gets put into play ;-)",
