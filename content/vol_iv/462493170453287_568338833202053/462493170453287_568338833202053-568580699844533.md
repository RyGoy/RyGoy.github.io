   "message": "\" I know there are some good lawyers\" - No. It's all fraud. There is NO such thing as a \"good lawyer\". The ONLY \"good lawyer\" is one that ignores/refuses the call to the BAR.\n\nYou want to learn the hard way that they are all fraud? I will HAPPILY prepare a list of questions for you, and you can see for yourself, that the \"good lawyer\" is just a scumbag, exploiting tragedy. We call them \"ambulance chasers\".\n\nThey get paid either way. Remember that. You can hold on to your delusion, if it makes you feel better, but you are simply WRONG... And I have a law degree in Canada, and the U.S., and when called to the BAR, I responded \"Why?\". No thinking ethical man (or woman) EVER becomes a lawyer.\n\nTL;DR - THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GOOD LAWYER! THERE ARE ONLY SCAM ARTISTS WHO CAN MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD.",
