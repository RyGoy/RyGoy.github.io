   "message": "Whenever a person asks a question and Scott Duncan answers, they must have the courage to do or endure dangerous or unpleasant thoughts that may conflict with their own beliefs. When the OP does not like and or agree with the answer which conflicts with their beliefs, they become fearful. When their belief is challenged and they lack a proper argument to counter the point presented by Scott, they call him a coward, shall we take look at the definition of COWARD?\n\ncowï¿½ard  \n/?kou?rd/\nNoun\nA person who lacks the courage to do or endure dangerous or unpleasant things.\nAdjective\nExcessively afraid of danger or pain.\nSynonyms\nnoun.   dastard - recreant - funk - poltroon - craven\nadjective.   craven - cowardly - recreant - chicken-hearted - timid\n\nClearly by calling Scott out as a coward, they are exposing themselves as the coward, as Scott has exposed them to a part of themselves harbored in ego which is too hard to look at and accept being a well and long standing belief held deep within in arrogance.",
