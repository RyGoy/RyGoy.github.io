   "message": "On another note, do I have this right?  I was born.  My parents and some bureaucrat made a person because the bureaucrat needed money and my parents were ignorant.  Then the bureaucrat published a notice in the paper and sent my parents a copy of the Birth Certificate.  My parents thought that represented me, but they were duped and mistakenly called me SURETY.  Then, when that person turned 7, some bureaucrat decided that the person was probably absent or dead because no one claimed it ( <<< is that sentence correct?)  So now there is an estate that needs to be collapsed (or the value needs to be taken away from it).....\n\nIs that right?",
