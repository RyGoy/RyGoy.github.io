   "message": "Thank you for the invite. I am about to take on what is at the moment a quite daunting pursuit of getting my NZ Student loan discharged. I do this as I have found out I MIGHT be arrested on my return to NZ for my wedding in December. I can tell you one thing, I will be kicking and screaming if they do, and will be making sure I am considered a political prisoner if they do. So I thank you all in advance for any advice, help, tips, information and guidance in the coming few weeks.",
