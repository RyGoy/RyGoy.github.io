   "message": "Hey everyone, this is a new payroll/paycheck thread. First I would like to say that the deductions from my check make me furious. Every week over a thousand dollars is deducted for Federal tax, this makes me crazy as I know this money is being used to destroy the family unit and the good men and women of this nation. \n\nTHIS MUST STOP, I have no intent, no matter how bad things get to collect the benefits of E.I. nor CPP. \n\nI have sent proper notice to the Commish of Revenue Canada, they went silent and stopped sending remittances and demands. As a matter of course and well past the notice of default I received the template letter telling me my claims were of no force and effect. At that point I filed a Statement of Claim in the Federal Court (silly me) (T-1395-12, under files tab is the judgement).\n\nSince that day (Prothonotary Ruling) I've not heard a peep from the CRA. Maybe I have them in a pickle, maybe not.\n\nFlaherty has been clear, The CPP is not in trust for future gens, its being used to pay the current batch of dupes sip'n sherry in Florida (if that is it's use). Whom do I lien to have that energy/equity/value flow to the trust. \n\nAs sole authorized rep and beneficiary of the NAME I suspect \nMY CORPORATION should lien the name into the trust (or would that be the trustee). This would place the Trust \"first in time\" whereby the Corporation (Trustee?) can Notice all parties (the Commish of Revenue CRA/ADP/ Receiver General?) to direct my equity/energy/value, Fed Tax, CPP and E.I. back to the trust. \n\nI dont want to work this job as slave much longer. My intent is to have as much value as possible flow in trust so that I can prepare for whats coming.\n\nlots of us are trapped on the ranch, some as cattle some as cowboys, we all report to the rancher whether we are chattels or empolyee's. Fuck that, my energy has value and the rancher is a pedophile\n\nIs this even possible, is my only option to leave the game altogether. I only want whats rightfully mine. Our malfeasant trustees must be done away with or forced to return our property. \n\nam I thinking wrong, do I value the wrong things?",
