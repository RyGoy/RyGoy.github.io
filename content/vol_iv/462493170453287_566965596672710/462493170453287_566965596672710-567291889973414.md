   "message": "There are no evil \"freemasons\" or \"Lou Manotti\". Semi-evolved chimps don't work that way. NO conspiracy lasts more than 4 years without being discovered. People are still dumb chimps, no matter HOW much \"power\" they have.\n\n6 people is ALL I'd need to take down this entire country. Do you think there are 6 people on the planet that can cooperatively act for mutual interest for ANY sustained period? History seems to lack such events.\n\nThese \"freemason\" conspiracies, and ...what's that other one, again? AH YES, The Lou Manotti! Yes. For any of those to work, you'd have to NOT be a semi-evolved chimp.\n\n...and no, there are no \"reptilians\" either.\n\nSeriously. The bullshit I have to fight here.",
