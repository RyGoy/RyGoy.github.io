   "message": "Statergy of tension.\n\nIt's ALL really just a global show done for the manufacturing of consent of the masses. \n\nGeopolitics is a club that transcends races and nations, with an ancient hereditary agenda that unfortunately for them requires mass consent, thus the wars, drama, et al. \n\nAll roads lead to Rome, imo...speaking of which, in 1984'ish rony Reagan (honorary Shriner and knight of Malta) re instituted the vaticans embassy which had been banned in USA since and because of their involvement/conviction in the Abraham Lincoln assasination trials. \n\nIt may be also of interest for one to examine the history of china and who it's leaders are also affiliated with. \n\nMore papal freemasonic knights, with oaths that transcend nation and race..? You be the judge:-)",
