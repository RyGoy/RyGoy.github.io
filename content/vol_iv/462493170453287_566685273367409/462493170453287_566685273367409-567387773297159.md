   "message": "\"Self absorption\"... that is what you think this is? Really?\n\nRemember I said this: You will be where you are now, 30 years from now. \n\n...if you aren't \"served and protected\" first, by a SWAT team.\n\nIf \"self absorption is ALL that empty little head of your can come up with, you are pretty much fucked. You exhibit the symptoms of somebody who was raised by a black christian family... \n\n...now I'm not saying your family is christian.\n...I'm not saying you are even black! (Not that there's anything WRONG with that)\n\nI'm just pointing out what your reactions correlate with, in the vast datastore that is my mind. You match up with \"Black Christian\" upbringing.\n\nIt's going to cripple/harm you in ways I never could. \n\nBut good luck with that! :D",
