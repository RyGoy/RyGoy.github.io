   "message": "I meant \"sheer horror\" in a similar context to people who are offended by Scott's ideas and his descriptions of Jesus for example. I meant no offense to Scott whatsoever. It reminded me of Apocoplypse Now and the realization of the \"sheer horror\" that truth/fun/jesting/reality can bring upon people. As much as it is not my place to do so, nor my business, nevertheless, sometimes I worry about Scott's safety. He has mentioned before that he is already a target to a number of groups of people. Sorry, if I offended Ceit Butler. :) This is mind breaking stuff stuff which some may not be able to deal with. Me personally....I LOVE IT!",
