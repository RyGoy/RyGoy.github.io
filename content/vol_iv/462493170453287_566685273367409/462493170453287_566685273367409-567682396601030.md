   "message": "4. negro\nA non-derogative term used to describe peoples of an African culture. Although of benign nature, people tend to regard it as an insult as it has been implied as such in earlier times.\n1. Child: \"One of my best friends is a negro\" \nParent: \"Well isn't that swell\" \n2. Secretary: \"Who shall I send into your office?\" \nEmployer: \"Will you send the negro in please?\" \nBlack Man: \"What did you call me?!\" \nEmployer: \"A negro. That was to differentiate between you and the white gentleman beside you.\" \nBlack Man: \"Oh ok.\"\n\nYup....I really just cut and pasted this from the Urban Dictionary!!  That is hilarious!!!",
