   "message": "i drove unlicensed/uninsured on public roads for the army, under full liability.... just didn't understand so when i do it now i dont suffer as much \"guilt\" as others. the police arresting me operate under the same conditions so its an opportunity to relate something to them. When i questioned this in the army they quoted an act from 1798 iirc, driving at his majesty's pleasure, it was at that point the curtain/republic started to fall for me.",
