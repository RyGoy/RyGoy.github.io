   "message": "The journey is inwards, all the bits we ignore about ourselves, some of which SD has forced us to see. I have done some research into quantum mechanics/physics, its all very interesting, if you walk into a wall enough times it suggests you will pass through it but this all runs secondary in my head because the reality is i'll bang my head on the wall.... i use that stuff as recreational time. Focus on the actual science & not people like santos who will only give his unqualified opinions on it... the real science is far enough out there without listening to loose interpretations ;)",
