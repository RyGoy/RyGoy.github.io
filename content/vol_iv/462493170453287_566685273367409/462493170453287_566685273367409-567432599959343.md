Why do the ignorant ALL BELIEVE THE SAME THINGS?\" All ignorance is the same because it stems from a lack of knowing and investigating truth. Ignorant statements are based on belief. The ignorant believe the same things because we have been programmed by nobles to believe in the same lies. Two examples are: sky daddy's are real and insurance helps to protect us.",
