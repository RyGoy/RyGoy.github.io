   "message": "i used to tune engines, i was very honest, to the point throwing money back at people & throwing them out, i had a dyno & wouldn't fiddle numbers, it was fuckin pointless! people would leave my place & go to another dyno to get better numbers..... as if that made their car any more powerful, but they were outwardly happy with the delusion :p",
