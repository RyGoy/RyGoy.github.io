Until then insulting people is a good way to 'teach'! (Not!) Like I said am NOT religious nor study it hence I know nothing about Buddism and it's connection with violence. (and if I did, would I ask that question?) I also don't know anything about how to repair a car (mechanics) so I guess that makes me vacuous and empty headed huh? (facepalm)",
