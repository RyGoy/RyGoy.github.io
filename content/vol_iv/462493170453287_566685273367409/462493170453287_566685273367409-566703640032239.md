Our nations never worship anything we always gave thanks for everything, appreciations if you would. I can only do so much in reminding folks of this. even here in Hawaii i had to correct a few of my mates who kept speaking of We are from Canada blah blah..i  said no we are not and said where we are from and told them to stop saying that. Also, they asked me if i could carry in the Canadian flag at the pow wow i said no, but i will carry in my nations flag and i did !!!",
