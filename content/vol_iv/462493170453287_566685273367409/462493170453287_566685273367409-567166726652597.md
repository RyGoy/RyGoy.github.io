   "message": "Ayahuasca, mushrooms, the resulting reaction to the poisoning of our biological functions( hallucinations) ... good fun but not reality.\n   I took Ayahuasca to deal with PTSD and to rewire my neural network by way of neural plasticity...\n  The resulting hallucinations are just brain candy that start a thinking process... bio-chemistry.\n   It has been ritualized and surrounded by it's own sets of beliefs IE: Shamanism. \n   Mushrooms are a more happy joyful thing... often equated to meeting God... again not reality.\n    Acid... fun but.... not real...\n    Therapeutic Value definitely... in my opinion.\n  It can stimulate thinking in a different manner...\n It is not a replacement for actual knowledge.",
