   "message": "import duty. See nCTY (4). \n\nduty. (Be) 1. A legal obligation that is owed or due to\nanother and that needs to be satisfied; an obligation for\nwhich somebody else has a corresponding right.\n\"There is a duty if the court says there is a duty; the law, like\nthe Constitution, is what we make it. Duty is only a word\nwith which we state our conclusion that there is or is not to\nbe liability: it necessarily begs the essential question ....\n[M)any factors interplay: the hand of history, our ideas of\nmorals and justice, the convenience of administration of\nthe rule, and our social ideas as to where loss should fall.\"\nWilliam L. Prosser, Paisgraf Revisited, 52 Mich. L. Rev. 1,\n15 (1953).\n\"A classic English definition [of duty] from the late nineteenth\ncentury holds that, when circumstances place one\nindividual in such a position with regard to another that\nthinking persons of ordinary sense would recognize the\ndanger of injury to the other if ordinary skill and care were\nnot used, a duty arises to use ordinary skill and care to\navoid the injury. A much quoted American judicial defi�\nnition of duty emphasizes its relational aspects, with a\nfocus on the foreseeability of risk to those 'Within the\nrange of apprehension.' At about the same time, one of\nthe most creative of American law teachers defined duty as\na complex of factors, including administrative, economic,\nand moral ones, to be applied by judges in their analyses\nof the legal strength of personal injury cases.\" Marshall S.\nShapo, The Duty to Actxi-xii (1977).\n\"While courts frequently say that establishing 'duty' is\nthe first prerequisite in an individual tort case, courts\ncommonly go on to say that there is a 'general duty' to\n'exercise reasonable care,' to avoid subjecting others to\n'an unreasonable risk of harm,' or to comply with the\n'legal standard of reasonable conduct.' Though cast in\nthe language of duty, these formulations merely give the\nexpression to the point that negligence is the standard of\nliability.\" Restatement (Third) of Torts � 6 cmt. a (Discussion\nDraft 1999).",
