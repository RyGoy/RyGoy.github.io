   "message": "Capri: Instead of continuing to lash out, why don't you stop and examine why you're taking being corrected so personally in the first place. \n\nSo some stranger pointed out that you were wrong...on THE INTERNET. So, now you are better educated on Buddhism and hey, the next time it comes up in a conversation, YOU can be the one to correct someone else! \n\nSo lesson learned, now move the fuck on.
