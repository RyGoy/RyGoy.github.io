   "message": "Here, with Ryan, is another clear example of why ALL FORMS of BELIEVE are evil. \n\nBelieve: accept that (something) is true, especially without proof.\n\nBELIEVE assigns VALUE to IGNORANCE, regardless that in REALITY, BELIEVE stands in the opposite direction of KNOWLEDGE. BELIEVE subtracts/eliminates VALUE from KNOWLEDGE. Therefore, someone with BELIEVES will \"believe\" that their IGNORANCE (believes) will magically trump KNOWLEDGE.\n\nThat is part of why ALL FORMS OF BELIEVE ARE EVIL.",
