   "message": "bitcoin is problematic.  it has transparency features which promise anonyminity but I believe there is no such thing considering when one pegs purchasing tendencies to a number it doesn't take much to figure out who you are.  it is nwo bait, and I'd be very wary of it, especially with how volatile the market is, and where this demand is coming from.  bitcoin is the stock market fraudster's wet dream, the evidence of it doubling in value overnight or dropping down to almost nothing over night (like it has done a number of times already) that it is a dangerous system.  i don't trust it, and when it's value gets big enough I am certain the plug will get pulled on it leaving people stuck with worthless binary data entries.\n\nAnyways when people fix the stock market there are regulations that try to prevent it.  I am wondering, what regulation prevents such things with bitcoin, that any number of elites could pull off on their own liquidity even (some of them)",
