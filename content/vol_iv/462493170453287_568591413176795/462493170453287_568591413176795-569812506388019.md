   "message": "SHOCKING NEWS:\"The concept of ki underlying Reiki is speculative and there is no scientific evidence that it exists; a 2008 systematic review of randomised clinical trials concluded that \"the evidence is insufficient to suggest that reiki is an effective treatment for any condition. Therefore the value of reiki remains unproven.\"[4] The American Cancer Society,[5] Cancer Research UK,[6] and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine[7] have also found that there is no clinical or scientific evidence supporting claims that Reiki is effective in the treatment of any illness.\"\n\nTL;DR - More delusion to social engineer.",
