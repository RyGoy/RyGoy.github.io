   "message": "I have few friends, of which, none are imaginary. I do have a big family and expect to get cut from a bunch of them. I don't have much in common with most of them, especially imaginary friends. It  seems that most will cut you for talking to someone they disagree with. My father for talking to his ex-wife, my mother for my first wife. They don't realize how much they have helped me by the phrase \"then you are no son of mine.\" both used it and both made a choice to relieved me of any obligation to them. That leaves me much more able to handle the culling the rest will do. I just hope to not ever be one of this group's cuts. There is too much VALUE in this group. Thank you to all of you who help in connecting dots for me. Without this information I would be so much farther behind.",
