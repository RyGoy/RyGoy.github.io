   "message": "Today's Word!  \n\nI'd like you all to indulge me for a moment. Close your eyes and imagine yourself in this scenario. You're trapped in a room at the top of a tall tower, backed into a corner near a window, with a menacing foe advancing towards you. (Hey, it could happen!)  \n\nClearly he is a threat to your physical well-being, nay, your life itself!  The terrifying stranger rushes you, but at the last minute you utilize a well-timed hip-toss and hurl your opponent through the nearby window!  \n\nAs his screams fade into the distance, you stop and ponder \"if only there were a word to succinctly describe this momentous event!\"",
