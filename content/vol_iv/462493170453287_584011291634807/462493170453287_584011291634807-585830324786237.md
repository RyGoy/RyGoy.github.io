   "message": "Today's Word:\n\nergophobia\n\nAlso called ergasiophobia, is an abnormal and persistent fear (or phobia) of work (manual labor, non-manual labour, etc) or finding employment.  Ergophobia may also be a subset of either social phobia or performance anxiety [no not that kind]. \n\nSufferers of ergophobia experience undue anxiety about the workplace environment even though they realize their fear is irrational. Their fear may actually be a combination of fears, such as fear of failing at assigned tasks, speaking before groups at work (both of which are types of performance anxiety), socializing with co-workers (a type of social phobia), and other fears of emotional, psychological and/or physiological injuries.",
