   "message": "All rise, the supernumerary is in the court, first matter if business is Her Majesty vs. DAVID VILACA, I stand up in the gallery walk to the bar not crossing and without a word spoken, they ask if I am the person they seek and I respond with \" I am the sole authorized administrator and and I will be speaking to the record, I reserve all rights in this court, I now convene a court of public record competant jurisdiction and accept both of your oaths of office, now before we begin there are some questions before the court that must be answered as I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings, the court clerk and prosecutor have had for some time my rebuttal  (have in hand proof of service) to the fallacious belief that I am surety in this matter, for and on the record, if I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR SUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led A COURT and/or STATUTORY BODY and/or A GOVERNMENT SERVICE and/or AGENTS and/or OFFICERS of such bodies, to believe, by responding to �You�, and/or �DAVID VILACA�, and/or SUCH OTHER IDENTIFICATION, such bodies HAVE ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am the PARTY WITH SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE, and please forgive me.",
