Beneficiaries will have to pay Income Tax on income that the trust receives. They might also have to pay Capital Gains Tax and Inheritance Tax.\n\nOn this page:\n\n    What is a bare trust?\n    Bare trusts and Income Tax\n    Bare trusts and Capital Gains Tax\n    Bare trusts and Inheritance Tax\n\nWhat is a bare trust?\n\nA bare trust is one where the beneficiary has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income held in the trust. Bare trusts are sometimes known as 'simple trusts.'\n\nSomeone who sets up a bare trust can be certain that the assets (such as money, land or buildings) they set aside will go directly to the beneficiaries they intend. These assets are known as 'trust property'. Once the trust has been set up, the beneficiaries can�t be changed.\n\nThe assets are held in the name of a trustee - the person managing and making decisions about the trust. However, the trustee has no discretion over what income or capital to pass on to the beneficiary or beneficiaries.\n\nBare trusts are commonly used to transfer assets to minors. Trustees hold the assets on trust until the beneficiary is 18 in England and Wales, or 16 in Scotland. At this point, beneficiaries can demand that the trustees transfer the trust fund to them.\nExample\n\nGary leaves his sister Juliet some money in his will. The money is to be held in trust. Juliet is the beneficiary and is entitled to the money and any income (such as interest) it earns. She also has a right to take possession of any of the money at any time.\n\nThis is a bare trust because Juliet is absolutely entitled to both the capital (the original money put into the trust) and the income (any interest earned).\n\nBare trusts and Income Tax\n\nTrustees may receive income from investments such as bank interest, dividend income from stocks and shares or rental income from land or buildings. The beneficiary is liable for Income Tax on income received by the trust.\n\nIf you're the beneficiary and you're entitled to any income from a bare trust, you should tell your tax office. If you don�t already do so, you'll need to fill in form SA100 Self Assessment Tax Return. The beneficiary is responsible for this tax, but it may be paid for you by the trustee.\n\nGet help completing your Self Assessment tax return in our guide below.\n\nYour tax return: the basics\n\nTrusts and Income Tax\n\nContact your tax office\n\nBare trusts and Capital Gains Tax\n\nCapital Gains Tax is a tax on the gain in the value of assets such as shares, land or buildings. A trust may have to pay Capital Gains Tax if assets are sold, given away or exchanged (disposed of) and they�ve gone up in value since being put into trust. The trust will only have to pay the tax if the assets have increased in value above a certain allowance. This allowance is known as the 'annual exempt amount'. The assets of a bare trust are treated for tax purposes as if the beneficiary holds the trust assets in their own name. In a bare trust the beneficiary pays the tax as if they owned the assets directly.\n\nIf you're the beneficiary you must declare any chargeable gains on your personal Self Assessment tax return.\n\nDownload guidance notes on completing form SA108 Capital gains summary\n\nTrusts and Capital Gains Tax\n\nBare trusts and Inheritance Tax\n\nInheritance Tax is sometimes payable if the person who put an asset into the bare trust dies within seven years of doing so. This is known as a 'potentially exempt transfer'.\n\nThe beneficiary is responsible for this tax.
