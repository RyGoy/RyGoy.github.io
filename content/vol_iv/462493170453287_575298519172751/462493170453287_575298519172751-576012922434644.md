   "message": "I live in a world filled with adults with imaginary friends, that consider such things \"normal\".\n\nI'm told by these adults with imaginary friends, that I am less because of it, and most think it's their right to harm me. The courts, and legal system come from the church. Wherever there is a parliament, there is a church.\n\nEver notice when the US \"Liberates\" (Invades) a country, they NEVER EVER install THEIR system of government which separates church and state? Why is that? ;)\n\nI have recently been accused of running a \"cult\" even though my particular \"cult\" encourages critical thought, and the removal of presumption.\n\nEver since I started teaching the masses, I have notice a steady campaign to demonstrate that I'm somehow \"less\" and it's OK to ignore the rules, because somehow I \"don't deserve\" such consideration.\n\nWhether it's the courts/cops stealing my home at gunpoint, or Idiots like Derek Hill passing himself off as an \"expert\" with materials I compose, its just a predisposition that I somehow have fewer rights than everyone else.\n\nI intend to collect that debt VERY soon. Interesting times ahead.",
