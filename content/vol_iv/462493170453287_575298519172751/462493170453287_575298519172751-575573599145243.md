   "message": "Extreme lower back pain forced ME to look further at possibilities of getting something to, at the very least, aliviate the pain without consuming big pharma's miracle poision's.                                                                                                                                                                        Thank fuck i took the advice of a long haul truck/lorry/tractor driver, after trying chiro unsuccessfully, and went and got some chinese doc. to have his fun with the little needles. I went from someone who could not even tie up his shoe laces to someone who could function once again.                                                                                   Fact tells ME that it was due to accupuncture. It could be percieved that i was suffering from the placebo effect yet that never has worked on me.                                                                                      If this is a shitstain and the tingle stick is my due's then so be it, my fact won't change.",
