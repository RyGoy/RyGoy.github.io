   "message": "Oh well, in the interests of full disclosure, it may be time I felt the tingly sensation:\n\nI was a Chiropractor for 18 years.  My focus was based around improving spinal biomechanics and posture, which has various knock on benefits, some subjective, some objective.\n\nMy focus was on the objective/measurable changes, Ranges of motion, postural improvement over time, increased grip strength etc.\n\nYes, there is a lot of pseudoculture in Chiropractic, as there is in medicine & the various health professions.  A philosophy on health/treatment modalities & methods is what allows the formation of a hypothesis and null hypothesis.  The scientific method then either validates or invalidates these.  A responsible profession then adapts its methods accordingly.  In some areas, Chiropractic as a profession acts responsibly, in others it needs to act more rapidly.\n\nMy aim was to focus on verifiable change, following which patients often reported various other subjective/quality of life benefits.\n\nIf this disclosure results in the tingly thing, then I thank everyone in advance for the information, knowledge & resulting clarity & confidence I have developed to ward off those who wish me harm.\n\nPeace.",
