Where are the \"ten commandments\" mentioned, and what do they have to do with \"morality\" (Although \"graven images\" is CLEARLY worse than rape...that didn't make the top 10, and is in fact endorsed by \"god\")?\n\nThere is NOTHING \"moral\" about ANY of the Abrahamic Religions. Christianity is the only one that claims \"moral\" superiority (in the West).",
