   "message": "OK..Let's look at the first \"Paragraph\"...\n\n***\nDean Otf Kory The Crown has brought only a circumstantial case before the court relying on showing a \"pattern of behavior\" to make their case and so It's clearly in their best interests to only show information,and what appears to be evidence of this pattern,by only using \"Cherry Picked\" information going as far as bringing incomplete information,deliberately deceiving information and un-truths into the court.The Crown is using the powerful influence of CONTEXT and the court is made suggestible in the face of only what it is permitted to see and hear and becomes acutely sensitive to even the smallest details.Examples of this manipulation are strune throughout the transcripts,reports and statements. One only has to scrutinize the pattern of behaviour of the Crown in their presentation of this miss information to see the deliberate deception taking place. \n***/\n\nUm...\n\nWhat?\n\nOk... Help me out here...\n\nIt can't be JUST me. Does this say ANYTHING?",
