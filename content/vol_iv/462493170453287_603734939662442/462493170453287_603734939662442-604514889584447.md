   "message": "I've only been invited here 4-5 days ago... Seems like I've just recently found some glue to bind what \"lawyers\" and \"elected officials\" have been calling \"my philosophical nonsense\" when I unsuccessfully tried to get answers from those I've been taught were the ones who \"knew the law\" and/or \"were supposed to protect the individuals' interests\"......\n\nThanks to Pierre Eleveneightfivetwo - over the past 2 months or so I learned more than over the past 2... huh 30something years... Nothing impressive to most of you, but...\n\nIf ONE THING : I DONT KNOW SHIT ! And I obviously did not know WHO/WHAT I AM NOT !\n\nI ignore the definition of many words which are used here. I even ignore the definition of too many of the words I've been using myself ! Ignorance is not an excuse so I need a law dictionary to make sure both me and the other parties agree to the definition that we use... Alternatively, they can also consent to stuff I declare.\n\nThere definitely is AT LEAST one PERSON in my pocket which was created 5 weeks after I was born - I always assumed it was me - IT'S NOT\n\nThat PERSON / taxpayer / employee of the state was created by the state. A person is a tool for commerce. \n\nIt's MY responsibility to learn exactly HOW to use it properly and to get a confirmation of who's/what's/where's SURETY FOR IT...\n\nSignature is consent / SURETY.\n\nSo far, asking for full disclosure of all the information I don't understand or know, ESPECIALLY from a person trying to make me sign as SURETY for whatever he/she/they claim the PERSON in my pocket may have done or not done, is one way to get confirmation that the state employs quite a few either incompetent or fraudulent persons...\n\nSide note : There obviously are passionate individuals here, and I've always believed you can have a pretty good idea of what anyone's worth by how passionate he/she isï¿½ We all have time, what we decide to do and achieve with that time determines our true value, and passion is the fuel for that.\n\nAnd Scott seems to be a very passionate guy !",
