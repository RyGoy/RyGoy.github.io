   "message": "It is actually thrilling to see all the quiet people speaking up. It's the only time you'll need to do it.\n\nThere's too many cops lurking around, and I am approaching my end-game. The final pieces are falling into place, and it's time to start a war.\n\nIn a short while I shall be \"turning myself in\" to the police. I need an alibi, and the cops will provide a very nice one.\n\nI can't be hurting/killing anyone if I'm in custody now, can I? :D\n\nFirst I need to teach all of you a few things, before I go...\n\n...but I need all the cops out of here.\n\nTo those who are whiny bitches like Jason Anderson: I don't want to hear your uninformed, ignorant opinion about how I run things here. YOU came to ME, not the other way around. \n\nI didn't invite you here,YOU asked to join.\n\nI gain NOTHING from you, and YOU are the one who benefits from MY TIME.\n\nIf you don't like the conditions I pose, remove yourself from the group without putting shit-stains here.\n\nThose who have stood up to be counted, and testified as to what they have gained here ARE BETTER THAN YOU. Therefore you will show respect to your superiors and leave quietly.\n\nIf you are a cop...\n\n...the shit my cat leaves in the litter box, is BETTER THAN YOU.\n\n/rant\n\nGOOD MORNING EVERYONE! :D",
