At the end, I get all the value.\nLegal Tender bounds YOU to Acts and Estatutes.\nGovernment is a service. \nGovernment is a TRUST.\nGovernment is NOT a person, nor a party, nor it has any standing.\nI AM the only party with standing, so... FUCK OFF!\nThere are no real judges, only unauthorized administrators and/or supernumeraries.\nUsing goverment terms is an invitation for standing/joinder.\nYou NEVER appeal to your rappist.\nMotion = take it the ass!\nThere is no authority to attach any information, such as legal names/address/birth date, derived from any public document to ME; doing so is fabrication of evidence, among other crimes.\nTrust Law is the highest form of Law. \nI can only trust ME.\nDon't let anyone define your trust.\nI am god.\nBelief is the end of knowledge, and it's evil.\nThe Nobility and the jew bankers are at war, we are in the middle.\nWe are on our own in this planet. Whoever runs out of bullets last, gets to live a little longer.\nThe end.",
