   "message": "I heard the recording but missed the point.\nI also was under the assumption someone was looking into it and did not want to muddy the waters.\nAt the date of the post I honestly could be of no help.  \nPete, if someone were to lien the court file it becomes a private matter between the lienor and the lienee which would be the court file. It would become a matter of equity.  Also  properly noticed and accompanied by a notice of mistake and identity waiver for the recipient of the phone call from the constable.  \nAnd then administrate it.\nThinking out loud as well.",
