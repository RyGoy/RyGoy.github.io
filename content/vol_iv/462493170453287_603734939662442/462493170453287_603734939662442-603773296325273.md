   "message": "Is there a Canadian equivalent to the 1099a - Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property reporting form? I'm looking into re-claiming my interest in bank transactions. \n\nI watched the \"Money as debt\" series again and have been doing some deep research. I think I might have stumbled onto the bank scam (one of them anyways). I'm going to sit down with a fiduciary from RC (Revenue Canada) in the near future and try to get some answers. Too many questions/too much manure to sift through.\n\nI'm suspecting RC is actually a subsidiary of the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) who is pulling the strings at some level. Not sure, I could be off on some of this. I plan on asking many questions.",
