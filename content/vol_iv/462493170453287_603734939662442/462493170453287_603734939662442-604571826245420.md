   "message": "I was actually just curious to know if you knew anything about them...\n\nTheir lawsuit doesn't interest me as much as the massive fraud they say they're trying to expose� I came across their story - among others - while searching info about the fiat system collapse� That's actually what sparked the whole debt thing for me� Obviously, I woke up too late, but I'm still glad this eventually lead me here�\n\nYou mentioned \"counterparts in indonesia, japan, the UK�\" if I remember correctly these guys have people based there too... I haven't been following their stuff much for at least the past year now, mostly because nothing seems to be keeping pace� \n\nI have no clue who you are, but you do speak as if you knew a lot about something coming up sooner than we may expect� \n\nDon't get me wrong, I absolutely don't pretend to know anything more than anyone else in here ! But I'm eager to learn, connect dots, and get a clearer picture, from every perspective, of how fucked up the system is�",
