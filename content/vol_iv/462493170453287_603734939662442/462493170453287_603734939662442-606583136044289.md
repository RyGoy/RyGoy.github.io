   "message": "The problem, as I see it, is not that things here are not \"dumbed down\" enough, but that they are presented in such a straightforward, simple fashion that one feels compelled to manufacture complexity. \n\n We are conditioned to believe that complex concepts must be difficult to understand.   We go through our lives without ever questioning what things mean, or why things are the way they are.  We never wonder what money is.  We only know we should have a lot of it.  We never wonder why people who essentially work for us, should not control us.   \n \nI'm not sure if a lifetime of conditioning can be erradicated.  It's like peeling an onion.  When all the layers are stripped away, you find there's another onion.  The best advice I can offer is to keep moving forward.  Try to avoid the programmed endorphine responses - when one word of encouragement or something learned gives you that satisfied feeling that you can permanently stop and bask in the glory of accomplishment.",
