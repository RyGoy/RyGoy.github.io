   "message": "We value the wrong things (broken). All of us are broken. The sad thing is we don't have to be.\nLike a drug addict that doesn�t care they destroy the family unit as long as they have their feel good fix.\nThey are obsessed with corruption and SO ARE WE.\nDoesn�t seem much difference between us and them, more like we are them.\nWE ARE THE ENEMY.\nUntil we stop using their mind.\nBecause we have their mind.\nHowever, we can stop using their mind.\nEmotions can't really be trusted and there's no reason why we should. They are not thought, truth or wisdom, they are simply a means to feel. There are truer emotions than the staged one's 'their' minds put on and those I suppose could be termed truer emotions. At least emotions not generated from an artificial place.\nAuthentic emotion is the word I'm looking for.\nPersonal experience tends to turn into personal observation. The more you observe 'their' mind the less of an environment it has to avoid. This is what Scott Duncan Offers.\nThank you Scott Duncan.",
