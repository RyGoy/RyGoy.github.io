   "message": "Since I have been here I have learned so much that my list would be extremely long. It has reinforced some things and created \"new\" things. The thing that stands out the most for me is when I was in grade school and discussing government and how it is \"majority rules\", we were told how it was based on your consent to be governed. I asked what if you didn't consent and didn't want to be governed by these rules and was met with the question \" how can you live here and not be under the governments rules? The answer I led myself to was you can't. It is this group that has taught me where I was wrong and HOW I was wrong in my thought process. It was the THINK WRONG AND VALUE THE WRONG THINGS that led me to WHAT IS MONEY. You see, in grade school I had come back to the fact that if you used \"legal tender\" you would be under their laws and since \"legal tender\" was on all money that I knew of, and BELIEVED it was the only kind accepted by the masses. Maybe this teacher was trying to tell me something. Maybe he knew about other methods and was not able to tell because it was not allowed. I may never know that answer but I have learned that not all money comes with this offer. Thanks to all of man in here who has shown me or led me to this knowledge, especially Scott Duncan.",
