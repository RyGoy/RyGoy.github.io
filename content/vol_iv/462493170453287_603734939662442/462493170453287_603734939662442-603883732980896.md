I FOCUSED in TTFL\n\n3). I made the decision to ASSUME that Scott Duncan is always right :-)\n\n4). I have made a deal with myself.....which I will revealed later ;-)\n\n5). I am pretty sure that none ONE post has been missed by me in this group.\n\n6). Even though I may sound funny sometimes, I take this TTFL extremely serious.....I would fight for this group.....litteraly, and man it paid off.....never in my life I have got so much from something.....NEVER.... \n\nSo I guess it has to do with priorities ?? :-D",
