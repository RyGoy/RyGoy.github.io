   "message": "I have learned that it's best not to leave shit stains about the administrative process one may 'believe' they understand after a few weeks of interaction here, that'll get you banned. Cops are futile, powerless, corporate henchmen who work in service of their puppet masters, not the public they swore to protect. Lawyers, judges...the same. Notary's have more legal standing than either one of the aforementioned. The post office registered mail has everything to do with conducting business and accepting surety in the US.",
