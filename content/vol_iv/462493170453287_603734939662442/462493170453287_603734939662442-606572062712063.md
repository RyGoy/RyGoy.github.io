   "message": "OK, just in case I haven't posted some of what I've learned, here goes:  1)  Trust Law is the highest form of law.  2) I invent/create the PERSON that is my master.  3) I take a NAME as it has power.  4) Given NAMES are accounts and are for commerce; they are NOT gifts.  I claim the value of the given name as I have contributed value to it; then lien it.  5) When I create a Trust, it is MY Supreme law!!!!",
