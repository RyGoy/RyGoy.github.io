   "message": "I know that every thing that Scott has told me here is the truth. Why, you ask, can I say this. Pure logic. A lie is a time consumer that, in the end always has \"no value\". Scott has no use for valueless things. Nor does he like to waste his time. The truth IS simple, pure and honorable.  I came here with a lot on my plate and a head full of theories and other Guru Crap and have found only truth here that helped me already. I've learned to trust in another again here. I've been tripped a few times in my life and with the \"help\" of others made the wrong amends and carried on. Now, I can, still with the guidance and knowledge from here, carry my own weight with Authority. I can not thank you enough Scott. [There's so much more that I want to say but I don't have enough time right now. I just got a call from CRA this morning and I've got to deal with this soon.] My wife is a shop-a-holic and has had the last 3 days off. I've been scrambling to say this before the 72 hour deadline. I'm off again with her for more mall madness. \"sigh\"",
