   "message": "Please let me stay in the group.  I have met the deadline, I can parse a sentence, and I don't take up much room.\n\nIt is impossible to convey to anyone reading in this forum the incredible kindness, patience and restraint you have afforded to me over the years while explaining, and reexplaining points that could easily be grasped by the average 6-year-old.  My many flaws and failures over the years weigh heavily on my heart.  What I have learned is how very little I actually know.  Nonetheless I remain quietly optimistic that with dogged determination, I can eventually return some small value. \n\nIf it's not too much trouble, Freedumb SuPerPowErZ would be very helpful.",
