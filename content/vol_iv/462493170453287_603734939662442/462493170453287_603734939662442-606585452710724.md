   "message": "The other point I would like to make is that being stupid, like being fat, is self-evident.  If you lament the fact that learning is \"so hard\", other people are conditioned to jump into the conversation and commiserate.  Endorphine highs for everybody.  Try to avoid the \"learning is hard...we are so stupid\" chorus.  It wastes your time and makes you feel good because you're part of the Learning for Dummies group.",
