   "message": "BC is not a corporation, it's a NEGOTIABLE SECURITY INTEREST, I came in here a free-man type so this was news to me.  Every time the state creates a document with the name on it, it is a new creation and it also has surety attached to it. They will try and get you to claim this surety mostly by presumption.  Shit, I know there is a lot more but I can't think right now. I know most important thing I've learned is Scott is always right, you just have to figure out why he is. Oh, yeah, DUH all belief is evil!",
