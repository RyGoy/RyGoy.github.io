   "message": "Asking questions deflects surety. Never answer their questions. Know what the questions are, know to recall those question without paper to back you up (they are now using video apperance for people like us as they do not want us in court speaking aloud) Speak only to the record, have all questions answered on the record. If you need to sign any paperwork to be freed from jail sign as Ceit Butler directed and never delay your Notice of Mistake, Notice of Questions to the Court and affidavit. Send everything via registered mail and fax to the court registrar/clerk and the Crown. Never ever go to court, only by force should you ever be in court, if it comes to forced appearance claim your status and hold your ground/contract. None of this matters as they will not honour nor follow the rule of law. Some will have to die, others to be marked for life (hand cut off), its coming down, hard and for those who don't understand the answer to everything, so long and thanks for the fish.",
