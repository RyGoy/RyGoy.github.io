   "message": "(I wrote a novel)\n\nHello All, my name is none of your business, unless you want to contract. Then maybe I will consider sharing it, oh and just to be clear if I have mislead you all to believe that I am SURETY, that would be a mistake, please forgive me.\n\nOh geez, where to start. Um, first and foremost I would like to thank Baby Jesus. Because a baby being born is what has saved my life.\n\nKidding, all belief is EVIL and I have really let that sink it. I valued the wrong things, clearly. I talked out of my ass for much of my life, and that is not ok. It was my own ignorance that got me here, into this mess. And it�s my own determination that will now get me out of it.\n\n- I am not SURETY\n- I am not ABORIGINAL\n- I have EQUITABLE TITLE\n- Government has LEGAL TITLE\n- For fucks sakes, I am NOT the name on the BC (that was a tough one)\n- EVERYTHING is about ACCOUNTING and SURETY\n- Create a proxy corp. Lien the name.\n- Notice of Mistake IS FUCKING AMAZING\n- Affidavits are a powerful tool\n- Lawyers are lying prostitutes\n- Imaginary friends are no friends of mine\n- THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER = joinder\n- This one got me, it helped a lot� Jails are WAREHOUSES to store/keep PROPERTY\n- I was once very stupid, stupider than what I am now� I am just a little less stupid. \n- There are club house rules, and I am NOT in the club house\n- I have my business, and the Government has theirs� what their business is, is NONE of my concern\n- Being a Battle Boat Bunny is an honor\n\nAlthough, I have been a part of this group for months, probably the beginning of this year, I did not participate in the discussions. Because, I will tell you, because I was scared of asking questions, I was scared of being deceived. Not from this group, but that I would begin to know HOW much I was being deceived by the Govt. In the last month and a bit, I have really attempted to participate, and understand more. I have done more research in the past month on this than this entire year. \n\nThanks Pete, for your dictionary, thanks Chris for that question you asked at the seminar, thanks Derek for your help too. Thanks Scott, for putting up with us, and coming back to the TTFL. I have learned a lot!! :D",
