   "message": "I have learned I have MUCH more learning to do  . I do not comment much , I read all that I can and then sometimes read it again and again until it starts to stick with me . I have learned not to accept everything I read as being true, that there is no replacement for actual research .\n\n I have learned being banned is a very easy thing to accomplish . I have learned NOT to show up in court , although truthfully I had stopped doing that before I became a member of this group . There is more , but I do not want to parrot what others have already said , though I probably already have . This group has truly helped me to realize most people I meet are idiots that have not a clue . Thanks to Scott and Tara and to all that have shared their knowledge so that I may benefit from it .",
