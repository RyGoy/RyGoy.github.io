   "message": "Tara Duncan, you summed it up very nicely.  Conditioning is a very hard cycle to break.  I've always questioned things, but did not realize I was being lied to.  I remember questioning money a long time ago....I took a college Economics course; the teacher laid a $20 bill and a $5 gold piece on her desk and then ask which one we would choose.  I was the ONLY one out of 23 students to choose the gold piece.  True Story!!!",
