   "message": "scotts whole point, there is no god because we are all god. the meaning is (both technically and proveably [fact]) that all men are equal. having being created or not (belief) is irrelevent. NO man has the right to rule over another by deceite. destruction of the deceiver and all supporting parties is unquestionably warranted because NO man or 'person' has the right to take advantage of another for gain/profit without being subject to offer&acceptance, and/or accord&satisfaction, and the protection of ones friends. hence the 'next friend' doctrine.",
