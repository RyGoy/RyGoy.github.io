   "message": "AM640 here in Toronto has a feature every Wednesday called the 'Legal Panel,' where the two lawyers they have come on spoke solely about this situation and about how BADLY these City of Toronto Councillors have fucked-up in acting arbitrarily and tossing-away Mayor Ford's right-to-due process and bringing the administration of justice into disrepute. The PODCAST of their interview is on their website here if anyone is interested in listening, its about 28 minutes long:\n\nhttp://www.640toronto.com/",
