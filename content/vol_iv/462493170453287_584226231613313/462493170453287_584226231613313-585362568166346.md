   "message": "This court-case goes to show the potential of just how DUMB a City Councillor can be:\n\n\"Conclusion\n\n[42]      The City�s application to the court is premature. The City must first exhaust its appellate remedy under MFIPPA. This approach ensures the integrity of the scheme the legislation establishes to determine information access rights. It will also provide any future court reviewing the decision of the Commissioner with a full evidentiary record, including the Commissioner�s findings. This court will therefore not hear the application.\"\n\nhttp://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc1495/2011onsc1495.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAMImNvbW1vbiBsYXciAAAAAAE",
