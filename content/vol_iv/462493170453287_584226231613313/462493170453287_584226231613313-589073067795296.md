I didnt vote for him because he was at the helm the majority of the time a BILLION $ were fucked-away with the E-HEALTH program.\n\nWhen Mayor Ford was a Councillor, he went on the John Oakley Show every Thursday morning and he spilled-his-guts about all the money, and all the various ways, Mayor Miller was PISSING-AWAY money down at City Hall.
