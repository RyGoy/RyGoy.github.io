This is as sure as the sun rising in the East tomorrow.\n\nWhy? Because your love of bullshit will anchor you there.\n\nThese are strangers imposing their will on you. nothing else. You have NEVER examined that one fact. You just focus on the scribblings of strangers.\n\nI WRITE LAW. I ADMINISTER law, and I OWN COMMERCIAL PERSONS... I have a need to know this stuff.\n\n...you don't. You don't have a Navy, the last time I checked. I do.\n\n...you do not have officers/trustees that you are LEGALLY and LAWFULLY responsible for. I do.\n\nAt this moment, here in reality, you are a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far. So am I.\n\nWhat we have in common DIVIDES RIGHT THERE.\n\nThinking like ME is WRONG FOR YOU. You are NOT me. I am.\n\nYou are wasting the ONLY value you have... YOUR FUCKING TIME, on the scribblings of strangers.\n\nThink about that.",
