   "message": "Start your own currency.\n\nThe Money ReportIt sounds complicated, but really it's as simple as three steps. \n\nFirst, amass a bank of stuff. Let's say gold. \n\nSecond, decide on a sensible unit for your new currency. Let's say one \"Derek Dollar\" token is worth a gram of gold. \n\nThird, convince a critical mass of people to use it so that \"Derek Dollars\" are redeemable not just within my group of friends, but among shops and merchants around the world. \n\nVoila, we've got our own private currency. \n\n\"Derek Dollar\" :D\n\nMuhahahahahahaha!!!!!",
