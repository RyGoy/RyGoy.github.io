   "message": "Tom Davis Quote:\nThe certificate MUST be an offer...at the very least it's an offer for citizenship. I've read once in the CED that citizenship is \"granted\", by the Minister, to individuals born on Canadian land. If something is granted to you, you have a choice of accepting it or not. Correct ??? Along with citizenship comes all those wonderful \"laws\" (statutes). If we accept this \"grant\" don't we become a trustee of this \"citizenship\" ??? Do I have it wrong, guys ???\n\nPete Daoust Quote\nOnly a PERSON can be a citizen, and I HAVE this PERSON in my pocket, but it's NOT me who created it, I just get to do some administration shit for it........\n\nDean Clifford Quote :\n\"Only a PERSON can be a citizen\", I disagree. There are many types of persons, and many types of citizens. What is the will and intent of the society you are joining, that determines what you will be recognized as.\n\nDean Clifford Quote:\nNope, you have it absolutely correct Tom\n\nPete Daoust Quote :\nOk, than name me something else than a person that could be a Citizen ?\n\nDean Clifford Quote:\nCitizen of what would be the next relevant question Pete.\n\nPete Daoust Quote:\nThe relevant question is give me another word than PERSON to fit with CITIZEN \nI suspect the answer being, there is NONE....\nHELLOSSSS !!! :D\n\nPete Daoust Quote:\nAnyway.....Dean disagree about me, saying \"only persons can be a Citizen....\nI asked him to get back to me with something else that could be a Citizen, other than a Person, and I am still waiting.... :(\n\nAny one in here could help me with this ?\n\nI broke my skull all day long on this, and fuck, I need to know.....\n\nI see 2 types of persons so far and 1 type of citizen, maybe 2, if corporate citizen is something ok to say :(",
