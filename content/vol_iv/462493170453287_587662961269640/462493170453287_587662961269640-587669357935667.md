   "message": "Well unlike Menard, Dean Clifford is ratified in the AQUILAE Trust. He's \"free\" (the trust cannot interfere unless explicitly requested) until that trust is breached.\n\nIf he chooses to victimize a group of worthless eaters, that's between him and his conscience.\n\nIn the end, I'm STILL right, and I simply have to wait.\n\nDean Clifford is a child. This is just where he is in his growth. Nothing more. His ratification is for the FUTURE, not now. Even if it was a brief flash of lucidity, he made the right choice. I'm a better slavemaster for the government...\n\nThat said; Mika Rasila is correct. If ANYONE is claiming there is \"remedy\" in the clubhouse rules for a club you aren't a part of, then they are lying. They aren't \"mistaken\". They aren't \"misinformed\". They are simply LYING.\n\nIf Dean is claiming this, he is lying. It's that simple.",
