   "message": "I'm sorry that hurts your precious feelings and you have to \"get used to it\". \n\nI fucking hate the lot of you and if I had the ability to snuff your lives out, I would.\n\nI'm keeping a promise. Nothing more. I have always been honest about that and everything else. EVERY SCRAP OF KNOWLEDGE YOU GET FROM ME IS AGAINST MY WILL AND IS ONLY BECAUSE I KEEP MY WORD.\n\n...Which is FAR more than ANY of you are capable of. You have NO IDEA how much I hate all of you and I have LEGITIMATE REASONS to feel this way. \n\nBut I keep my promises.\n\n...which is 1000000 times more than you will get from the Free-Dumb movement.\n\nI'm not one of these Free-Dumbers. Don't lump me in with them.",
