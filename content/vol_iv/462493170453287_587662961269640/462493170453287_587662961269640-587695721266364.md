   "message": "You are born into a world that is part of a closed banking system. That's the truth.\n\nIt was created by an elite commercial class in English Society in the 1500's. The US war of independence was to ESCAPE the closed banking system of the Commerce Class (The Nobility).\n\nIt started because the EAST INDIA CORPORATION was in trouble... and they were \"too big to fail\". Sound familiar?\n\nIt was engineered to be automated and self-maintaining, and it was designed to run in cycles.\n\nNothing before 1500 AD actually exists in commerce and is considered \"prehistory\".\n\nYou live in the end of one of those cycles.\n\nThat's it.",
