   "message": "I get it Scott, Pooh-bah lies by omission by keeping you believing you are NOT ENTITLED/AUTHORITAH... Rather, keeping the focus on the Clubhouse Rules and following them instead of seeing THROUGH them. Which is what the Liars do...\n\nAs there may be much validity to examining the Clubhouse Rules, it is the underlying LOGICAL REALITY derived from these \"rules of massacre\" where you will SEE the truth.\n\nThis only goes to show how much we have learned how to LEARN...\n\nAnd... Shakespeare sucks. You almost need to study HOW to read that shit.\n\nThank you, Scott",
