   "message": "One of the most empowering things I have learnt that If a Private trust has a covenant and the trustee corporation has a charter.\nThose are the laws that apply... \nessentially you have your own court...\nJust like theirs except it is for the exclusive benefit of the sole Beneficiary.\nThe terms and conditions of commerce are with the trustee corporation, through its chartered mandate, that administers the affairs for the benefit of the sole shareholder and the benefit of the sole beneficiary of the Trust.. a Trust itself doesn't act it is A TRUST.. Private makes it a law maker unto itself.. through by-laws, which the current courts use on land  (which is the only place commerce exists. )  based in Admiralty Law...\nSo a trust in reality is its own admiralty so to speak.\nTerms and conditions = laws",
