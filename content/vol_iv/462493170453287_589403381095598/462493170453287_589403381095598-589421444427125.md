   "message": "Not wanting to be a parrot at all.  \nPhrases were example's of possible answers to  a thug with a gun...\nTruly seeking to think my way through this..\nIt solves nothing parroting...\nThe gang colours analogy is perhaps the best I have heard so far..\n It is not MY name... It was given to me.. by a trust established at birth by parents and Government..\nSo it is truly theirs... I have no rights to their creation until I stop them from benefitting via lien...\nthen there is the Whole VALUE question.\nWhich once one does this (Lien), the person assigned to us has no value other than what my labour of a lifetime is determined by accounting,  at birth, so the Govt then can borrow against my lifetime ( collateral), creating more debt...  \nAh shit.... smoke is coming out of my ears as the sawdust burns away...\nBeing a Director via A Private Trust insulates me from their offers... however the trust take no actions it is done through the administrator ( corporation) which is accountable to the sole shareholder, and is directed to issue currency to its shareholder thru the offices of Chief administrator.\nIs that a correct way of stating it?\nOf course Sole Authorized Administrator says a lot...",
