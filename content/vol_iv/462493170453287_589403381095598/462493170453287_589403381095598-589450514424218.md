   "message": "You as Master is still using their creation to your benefit... \nHowever if one makes a mistake in dealing with a clubhouse that has it's own governance, the consequences could be serious. I do not know the rules nor am I inclined to learn statutes, acts and laws...\nHowever to administrate I need a working knowledge.. The Trustee corporation assumes the liability, in dealing with the affairs of things that once examined and dissected do not concern me... \nIf It is not my will... which is directed through the corporate charter... My own charter of rights and freedoms... that recognizes and respects other trusts to insure my recognition and respect acting As President.",
