   "message": "OK, I let this one through, because you people keep posting it.\n\nGET THIS CLEAR: This guy is a kook. Just because a kook can say \"2=2=4\"does not make his delusions about \"spaceships in Greenland\" a useful contribution.\n\nWhy do you people shit on truth? Why do you think this feces-laden shit is as good as ACTUAL truth?\n\nThe worst part is that a lot of you will say \"If the language thing is true, maybe the Greenland Spaceship might be too\"!\n\nFUCK OFF WITH THAT SHIT! If I shit on your meal, you won't accept that \"it's just as good as the original, and I can pick out all the shit\". You can't. It's that stupidity that turned you into the idiotic credulous dolts that you are now.",
