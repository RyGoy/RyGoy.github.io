   "message": "I don't want to go the court route so I'm about to lien a bank, & its CFO for not honouring their contract with me and a lawyer. Rather then create an affidavit of obligation, I'm thinking of sending them a copy of the public notice. Give them 10 days to respond and then create the lien if no response and publish the public notice. Is there anything I need to be aware of that I've missed or any other suggestions?",
