   "message": "<<Stuart Stone: As Scott says...the problem is realizing that you have no value...the bank may offer $1000.00 in exchange for a $1 million lien...>>\n\nI have been thinking the same thing. \n\nWhat is/has been \"The Tender for Law\" all about? There lies all the answers.\n\nI have been building me a new PROGRAM, using the information given by Scott. It all start's with \"it's all about SURETY and ACCOUNTING,\" and then keep building on that. \n\nMy program tells me to focus on MY TRUST, in MY LLC, get a CLUE and get my accounting done, how to create CREDIT with minimum liability, all with the little new world I have created for MYSELF. A world I created, a world I can control. What I don't control, I just wont worry about.\n\nSo, I have created a \"Bullshit File\", a filter. A HUGE fucking filter. I put EVERYTHING in the \"Bullshit File\" first. Then, if is not in accord with what I have learned here/been programmed here, it STAYS in the \"Bullshit File\". It works WONDERFUL! \n\nThis is what it's in/on my mind, ALL THE TIME:\n\n<<Scott Duncan: The very name of this group, THE TENDER FOR LAW, is all about that mysterious phrase, �THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER�. \n\nI'll be the first to admit there are a great number of benefits to be enjoyed in commerce, when everybody plays by the rules. As I'm sure everyone is sadly aware of, by now; Nobody is playing by the rules anymore. \n\nTrying to �fix the system�, or call them to account in their own system, is simply �appealing to your rapist�. It baffles me that anyone would think this is sound thinking.>>\n\n<<Scott Duncan: As I'm in a unique position to �follow the money�, I can determine who needs to pay the price for the royal screw-over we've been given. As I type this, a team of system's engineers (and trained monkeys) are preparing for you, the reader, a step-by-step guide for cleaning out every financial institution that touches these shores. The only price that I ask for this knowledge is that you pass it on to others. Pay it forward...and get paid at the same time. Who else offers that shit?\n\nI am many things. I am prorogued Nobility. I am a published author. I am a composer. Above all...the thing that forms the core of who and what I am, is that I am a computer scientist. Those who have taken the time to actually listen to me, will recognize many �Scott-isms�; and the phrase �COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING� is repeated almost as often as my Number 1 �Scott-ism�, �THE MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG.� You ignore these two truths at your own peril. \n\n...and reality does not care what you �believe�.\n\nThis lengthy preamble is to drive the next point home. \n\nDO NOT TRY TO COMBINE DEAN'S METHODS WITH MINE.\n\nThere is no remedy in fraud. There simply isn't.>>\n\n<<Scott Duncan: I lien the NAME because I GAVE IT VALUE. I want the value, not the government. Now it's trust property.\nWhat exactly did you expect \"them\" to give you, when you demand they \"give you the bond\"?\nWhat IS this shit you've pulled out of your ass?\n\nA lien puts you first in line when it comes to monetization.\nYou become your own creditor. YOU get all the value. \nBUT IT BELONGS TO THEM!\nWhat are you going to do after?\nWalk into the BANK OF CANADA with a $20 bill screaming \"give me the fucking bond\"?\n\nDerek Moran: So you placed a lien on the Bond.. does PPSA act like a bank to get the value for it out of it?\n\nScott Duncan: No. If I have VALUE, I ALREADY HAVE it. I don't need to \"get value\" out of a claim. It's just a claim.\nIf my name has VALUE I GET THE BENEFIT. Before I claimed it, THE GOVERNMENT DID.\nIf you didn't SIGN IT, then YOU DON'T OWN IT.\n2 signatures and a TRUSTEE\nyou dont own it, until you claim it.. you dont claim it, until you lien it\nWas that so hard to grasp? \nYou STILL don't own it. You are JUST THE BENEFICIARY of the VALUE. Just like the bearer of a $20 bill is the BENEFICIARY of the VALUE.\n\nNOBILITY COMMANDS WITH QUESTIONS\nADMIRALS COMMAND WITH REQUESTS\nGENERALS COMMAND WITH ORDERS\n\nWhy do you care what these strangers have done? Do you need their PERMISSION to claim it? WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO THEM?\nAre you WINDOW SHOPPING for SERVICES?\nPerhaps you can mail the ministry of natural resources and ask if you are wildlife too! Good use of your time. I can really see it's paid off.>>\n\n<<Scott Duncan: Seriously. Lien it and use your name without JOINDER. Seriously! THESE ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS! STOP TRYING TO JOIN THEIR PARTY!\n\nToo many points of failure. \nLien your name. Goodbye government.\nStart a corporation\nMake an \"internal\" currency.\nGET A CLUE and do your ACCOUNTING.\nGo live your life. THE END.\nJust make sure the shareholders are people you TRUST.\n\nYou are like a gold-digging whore who spends but doesn't want to fuck the old rich guy.\nStop trying to \"profit\". JUST EXCHANGE. This is NOT a Ben Lowry \"game the system\" course.>>\n\n<<Scott Duncan: You need to CLAIM the VALUE you have contributed to the name. Lien the shit out of it, and call yourself something else. No \"given\" name. Only TAKEN names have power.>>\n\n<<Scott Duncan: LIEN IT so THEY get no value. You are free then... except you can't get credit. ...but your corporation can!>>\n\n<<Scott Duncan: The government is not a PERSON. You have a PERSON and YOU are responsible. You contracted with a TRUST, not a PERSON. The signature PROVES you UNDERSTAND. \nThere's ONLY ONE PERSON INVOLVED, YOURS!\nTHE PERSON (There IS only one in the transaction) is ALWAYS responsible. \nGOVERNMENT is a TRUST.\n\nBIRTH CERTIFICATE = BILL OF LADING\n\nParents were the GRANTOR (one of the parties that created the bill of lading).\nListen up and pay attention.\nYOU ARE THE CARRIER!\nA Truck ACTING AS CARRIER is NOT \"120,000 RonCo Turnip Twaddlers\"!\nIT IS, IN FACT, A CARRIER THAT HAS \"120,000 RonCo Turnip Twaddlers\"!\nIt's delivering it to YOU (The Beneficiary). It just hasn't arrived yet. \nYou don't know that YOU own the CARGO. If you OWN the cargo you are transporting you are no longer in commerce. You are transporting PROPERTY.\nThe NAME is the CARGO, and the BIRTH CERTIFICATE is the BILL OF LADING. It's valueless on it's own. Hence the term \"Sold a bill of goods\".\nOk, got it so far (I think)...so when you lien the name, are you doing it because you haven't been paid for transport/carriage of the goods? You are letting the world know that the cargo is in fact YOURS. Nobody has the right to presume your cargo is for commerce now. That i ALL a Lien is.>>",
