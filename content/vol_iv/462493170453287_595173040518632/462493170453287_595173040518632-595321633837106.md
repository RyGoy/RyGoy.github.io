   "message": "To further this....I asked my bank why I couldn't have my negotiable instruments (cancelled checks) back at the end of the month since I bought them and they are my property....the lady pointed me to a clause in the Depositor agreement that said \"....to replace checks with 'substitute checks'....this is a LEGAL copy of your check\".  What they have done with MY property is retained EQUITABLE rights to the instrument while giving me back LEGAL rights.  This is one of the reasons why the so called \"National Debt\" has skyrocketed since 1997....Once this property that they are holding becomes abandoned (I think 3.5 years), they are re-securitizing it to get more Money on Account for themselves.  This is the reason why Scott said to lien EVERY Account that belongs to you.",
