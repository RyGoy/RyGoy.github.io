   "message": "The value of the lien on the person needs to be tangible & accountable (which is what your accountant is for), to validate the claim of value in the ledger...and to keep it objective and at arm's length from the corporation's valuation.\n\nScott mentioned something along the lines of earning potential x 65 or 70 years.\n\nPlus whatever value is already in the name...this is why I have established (and am still establishing a few liens against other parties), to raise the book value of the person, prior to liening the name into the private trust.\n\nDerek Moran explains how the money supply increases due to fractional reserve lending, blowing out the money of account versus cash reserves...you may wish to use a similar extrapolation for the value of the person when creating the lien.\n\nIf the accountant can validate it & add it to book value, then it is doable...just depends on the creativity of the accountant...that's what the accountant is for: to keep the valuation at arm's length from you ie: a third party confirming the value.\n\nI'm a bit more conservative:\nEarning potential x 75 years plus other asset value plus value of liens = current dollar value of person to be liened.\n\nReserve the right to determine current value in gold, silver, oil, bitcoins, average value of land/real estate, factor in inflation & periodically revalue against these tangibles (useful if the currency gets hyperinflated through printing, so your lien value can blowout/be recalculated in accordance of the devaluation of the currency).\n\nThe public notice only needs to notify the property that has been liened (property description) & into a private trust (XYZ Private Trust) held by ABC Corporation.\n\nBoobie's description is more than adequate...intent is key...and the book value can be borrowed against for corporate activities :D",
