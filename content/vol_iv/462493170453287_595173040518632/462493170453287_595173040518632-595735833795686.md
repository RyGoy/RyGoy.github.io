   "message": "I need an accountant, PRONTO! \n\nI need a DIRTY accountant... muahahaha!\n\nThe Admiral said:<<Discovery of computer science is inevitable, and accountants will find it first. I'm not going to find any gold in the Klondike if I don't go to the Klondike. You're not going to find computer science if you don't go to where math is used constantly...\n\n... Bookkeeping's a boring job, isn't it? Those who have been saddled with such a task will know what I'm describing when I speak of numbers dancing in your head, and you, being a pattern-seeking mammal, indulge yourself in the boredom by seeing how you make these numbers dance in a pattern you have not yet seen.\n \nThis is actually a very profound process and a lot of people miss it. The last thing the Romans wanted were smart bookkeepers. Bookkeepers make the rules. None of you see that. Watch �The Agenda� with Steve Paikin. VALE and the Chartered Accountants of Ontario sponsor the show, and they'll proudly tell you how long they've been setting PUBLIC POLICY. \n \nNone of you are aware of this, because none of you think; and Steve Paikin's shows are for people who can think, so there's zero risk of discovery.\n \nYou can see for yourself, your masters laughing at your idiocy...\n\n... 3: Get ANY accountant to manage the books of the corporation. You direct the corporation as FIRST DIRECTOR, and establish roles (President/CEO Vice President, etc) which is how the UNITED STATES was formed...\n\nThe accountant EXECUTES YOUR TASKS within the framework. To establish a trust, write it down, and have it witnessed and notarized. The end. Only shareholders of your corporation are recognized by the trust...\n\n... ACCOUNTANTS only have jurisdiction over MONEY OF ACCOUNT. MONEY OF EXCHANGE is YOUR JURISDICTION.>> Scott Duncan",
