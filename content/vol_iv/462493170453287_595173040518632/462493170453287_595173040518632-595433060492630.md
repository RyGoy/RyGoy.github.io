You give up your right to travel and in return, you get a Legal Title with YOUR picture on it and Privilege. They are holding your Equitable Rights and you are exercizing your Legal rights through the constructive Trust.>>\n\nI like what Mackximus Minimus is saying here...except it's NOT your picture anymore...it's the document's picture (you didn't put it there, someone else did)...it may be a likeness of you, but it's not you...same as the signature is now the document's signature (if it's a plastic laminated licence like in the UK, then it's not possible that you signed it...you may have signed some piece of paper & the signature copied onto the licence, but YOU didn't sign it).  Winston Shrout is very clear on this.\n\nWaive the right to be recognised as a person...if I have lead the court to believe etc.....please forgive me.\n\n'I am able to function in the capacity of sole authorised administrator for the person/this matter if the court pleases, but if I have led the court to believe that I have assumed surety  for this matter or that I, a man, am a name derived from a public document, would be a mistake, so please forgive me.'\n\nIf it gets too hot in the kitchen, then pay the bloody thing & get out...learn from the experience & come back stronger next time...or if you have a higher risk tolerance, ride it out & see where it leads.\n\nALWAYS ask questions, answer a question with a question.\n\nContinually halt proceedings  until your questions are answered, otherwise it is not possible for you to be able to understand the nature and cause of the proceedings...make it clear that you are honourable & peaceful & here to help the court out because some sort of mistake has obviously been made...\n\nThis is just theory from my end...I've not stood in your position Chris Evan",
