   "message": "Every encounter with corporations is a new contract offer. Cops, courts, McDonald's etc... Once you make it very clear that no commerce is expected or implied the burden is on them to prove a debts origin regarding any charges... \n\nEvery question they ask is designed to engage you commercially... \"He who creates owns\"... I didn't create the driving license, therefore I don't own one...No contract, no surety, no money...\n\nThat's my understanding... Equitable and legal title discussion I find confusing... :(",
