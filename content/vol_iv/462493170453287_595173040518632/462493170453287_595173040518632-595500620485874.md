   "message": "I say that anyone describing oneself with ANY word from a dictionary, fell for the trap. \n\nIt's part of the programming that we somehow feel the need, because we have been programmed that way, to \"describe\" ourselves using WORDS.\n\nThen we go to the dictionaries very conveniently handed to us, and look to other AUTHOR/AUTHORITY for THE words that would BEST describe US. And we end-up describing US with THEIR titles/words.\n\nLike \"Christians\" say \"I am a MAN!\" Well, let's look for the definition of MAN. A BOND SERVANT and/or a VASSAL. What is a VASSAL? They sucked the Nobles' dick. Who wrote the \"bible\"? The Nobility.\n\nI am ME! :P",
