   "message": "Here's some comments Dean has made to me in the past:\n\n Dean Clifford: The BC was valuable consideration for something of value you deposited, period. They are bankrupt, and your deposit technically has no dollar value because it is entirely dependent upon how many worthless notes are in circulation. So, they had to give you something, a note, that did not have a face value. A token, redeemable for......something.......sooooo close Derek, keep going. You're dancing on it, but looking up. hahahaha\n\nDean Clifford: \"Scott has conceded to me that CANADA the corporation's shares trade on the Luxembourg market- SO, i think what you're trying to tell me Dean, is that my BC is REDEEMABLE for the DIVIDEND-PAYMENTS for the SHARE they gave me thats safely sitting in the Bank of Canada\"........and.........not just that.........",
