   "message": "So......about this lien.  After one files proper Public Notice, how does one lien the NAME?  I have heard a couple different ideas.  One school of thought seems to be to lien the NAME for say $2 mil per year every year (or break that down into months...but you get the idea).  The other is lien it for say $100 mil one time.  \n\nI am not sure what is best although I see the merits of both.  One way, it doesn't raise any suspicion, the other is flat out obvious and should stick out at the Secretary of State.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
