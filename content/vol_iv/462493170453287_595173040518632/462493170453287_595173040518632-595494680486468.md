   "message": "I looked at the definitions for \"freeman\" in some of the most \"trusted\" dictionaries. From what I can tell, \"freeman\" is a TITLE, and it could only be GRANTED. You cannot call yourself \"freeman\" on your own, SOMEONE has to grant that TITLE.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but that's what I am reading.\n\n<<What is FREEMAN?\nThis word has had various meanings at different stages of history. In the Roman law, it denoted one who was either born free or emancipated, and was the opposite of �slave.� In feudal law, it designated an allodial proprietor, as distinguished from a vassal or feudal tenant. (And so in Pennsylvania colonial law. Fry�s Election Case,71 Pa. 308, 10 Am. Rep. 098.) In old English law, the word described a freeholder or tenant by free services; one who was not a villein. In modern legal phraseology, it is the appellation of a member of a city or borough having the right of suffrage, or a member of any municipal corporation invested with full civic rights.A person in the possession and enjoyment of all the civil and political rights accorded to the people under a free government.\n\nLaw Dictionary: http://thelawdictionary.org/freeman/#ixzz2mSJTM9Dd>>\n\n<<Black's Law Dictionary (9th edition) defines Freeman as 1. A person who possesses and enjoys all the civil and political rights belonging to the people under a free government. 2. A person who is not a slave. 3. Hist. A member of a municipal corporation (a city or a borough) who possesses full civic rights, esp. the right to vote. 4. Hist. A freeholder. Cf. VILLEIN. 5. Hist. An allodial landowner. Cf.
