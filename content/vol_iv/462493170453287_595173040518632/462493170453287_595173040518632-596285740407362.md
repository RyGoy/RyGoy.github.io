   "message": "<<<<Scott Duncan: I just showed you how to survive without Fiat currency. Create a person. That person acts as currency exchange.\n\nYOU only accept currency that is NOT fiat currency. If people want your servies/value, they have to BUY YOUR CURRENCY.>>\n\n<<I have a much larger agenda. It involves making wealthy free people. This makes them happy and grateful...and very angry and violent when strangers try to take what they truly KNOW is theirs.\n\n...It's also quite handy when a lot of grateful people owe ME a real or perceived debt, and I happen to find myself in a position where I need to raise a task force to protect my interests.\n\nTHE TENDER FOR LAW project is just one of MANY that I have going right now. Everything you see is carefully planned. Even REICH-ROLLED will trigger a desired action in the right place.\n\n...but its only purpose is to keep to a private oath. I'm going to show you all how EVERYTHING works, and how to exploit it. You will get wealthy, if you learn everything, but you should give the surplus, to me. Interest free. I will return it whenever you wish. I just need it for a short time to build an illegal bank. Nothing too scary.>>\n\n <<Scott Duncan: If you waive the benefit of the ACT, the name is \"abandoned\" but has a claim... except the government is not a PERSON. They have NO authority to claim. They can only have custody. Custody - Custodian. Simple huh?>>\n\n<<Scott Duncan: Lien the AG's office with the court file as the account.\n\nAnd lien your own property.\n\nThis is just tossing it out there. \"last minute\" is not something I do. Every time, either the client lies, or the data I get about the case is inaccurate. I can't work with \"last minute\">>\nNovember 13 at 5:27am � Like � 1\n\nMackximus Minimus <<Scott Duncan: WHAT DISTINGUISHES THE TWO?\nOWNERSHIP\nPOSSESSION\n\nThere is only ONE difference.\n\n*sigh*\nLAW is about CONTRACT for COMMERCE and its INTENT.\n\nThe ONLY thing COMMERCE (and therefore Law) cares about is MONEY, so THEREFORE, if you OWN it, you can SELL it.\n\nTitle is all that is sold.>>\n\n <<Scott Duncan: But Roguesupport Inc. may only hold trusts, and acts in commerce in name only, to maintain operations and the trust. So the money I get paid, goes into YOUR TRUST. A big-ass crypto-trust where every last fucking cent is accounted for, 24/7. Every second, of every day. Only the beneficiaries of the trust can attach and see it. To everyone else, it's just a UUID public key. NO NAME. I mean, do you REALLY care if you buy a TV with a crypto-currency?>>\n\n<<3 years ago, you had never heard of a 3d printer, now you can get one for under $2000.\n\nTrust me when I say, you will be able to \"print\" genome \"patches\" with off-the-shelf equipment. You just need the knowledge/skill. We can ALMOST do that NOW.\n\nAll you need to do is keep up. That's what I'm doing now. You have to CATCH up... which is NOT easy, and is getting harder every day.\n\n...it's easier to think \"jesus did it\". That's the problem, because as I said, we have learned more in the past 10 years than we have in the past 2000 years, and every day you think \"Jesus did it\", is a day 300 new things are discovered, and we move ever farther apart in the whole \"Knowledge Gap\".\n\nEventually I'll need to be \"employed\" by the commercial science industry, because the rest of you would be too stupid to provide any value.\n\n...but I truly tried to wake people up in time. It's too late. Tara Duncan lives her life on an intellectual stair-master that never stops...and that's just so she can keep up. She has access to me 24/7.\n\n...what chance do any of you have?\n\nIt won't be \"repo men\". It will be a transfer of ownership. You will be \"owned\" by somebody like me.\n\nSomeone like me who studies REALITY and not imaginary sky-daddies TODAY, will decide if you live or die, tomorrow.>>\n\n<<Scott Duncan: I'm just warming up, Trent! \n\nIt's going to take a bit of social-engineering, and a LOT of teaching, but I am building something HUGE. \n\nWhen thetenderforlaw.com is up, then I will start showing you how to secure your freedom with technology. Not only that, I will show you all, step-by-step, how to do EXACTLY the same thing. All the government stooges can do is tremble in impotent fury, while we construct beyond their understanding.\n\nI'm waiting for a declaration of \"crazy\" from the government, so I am free to disclose EVERYTHING... including the very contract that bound me to keep my mouth shut. \n\nSo, I'm glad you appreciate it, and am overjoyed that you are actually USING it in its proper manner. \n\nIt's not an ego-boost, it's reassurance that I'm not wasting my most precious asset; My time.>>",
