   "message": "Mackximus Minimus: I looked at the definitions for \"freeman\" in some of the most \"trusted\" dictionaries. From what I can tell, \"freeman\" is a TITLE, and it could only be GRANTED. You cannot call yourself \"freeman\" on your own, SOMEONE has to grant that TITLE.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but that's what I am reading...\n\nCorrect...In some of the UK statutes I read through regarding council tax/liabilities of the inhabitants becoming the liabilities of the council, there are references to Freemen.\n\nThe title is obtained (paraphrasing here), by declaring yourself a freeman & then registering same with the local mayor (kinda defeats the purpose)...the title can then be passed down through the family.\n\nThe change in status has been repealed from the legislation & I couldn't be arsed to go digging for it.",
