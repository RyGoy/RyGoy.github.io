   "message": "So here are some  comments from a forum who loves me and loves to discuss what i do to try and help my people and myself understand this criminal system called Law by a foreigner called the Queen. Tell me your thoughts on this ?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nPostby Burnaby49 � Sat Nov 30, 2013 9:53 pm \nThe Chief's rants about his rights and status tend to be about his claimed legal status in relation to non-indians, he says nothing about any special status or position he holds within his First nations Community. Since he is not a guy to hide his light under a bushel I assume he has no special status. He is \"Chief\" because he calls himself that, not because he is actually a Band Chief.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPostby LordEd � Sat Nov 30, 2013 9:45 pm\nIs there some first nations group that recognizes the chief as having some form of special status or title?\n\nOr is he the equivalent of a janitor playing CEO in the boss' chair at night before taking out the waste bin?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nby Burnaby49 � Sat Nov 30, 2013 9:40 pm \nI think (I make no claim to any depth of knowledge about the Chief's belief) that he hangs his hat on two points. The first is that he is First Nations and so the normal laws of Canada don't apply to him. Simply put the Notary Society has no jurisdiction to regulate his activities. The second is magic incantations that mean, even though he calls himself a notary, he isn't a notary as defined by the Society. Note that last line on his Notarial Signature I copied above;\n\n\"Non Domestic without Canada\"\n\nI think he is trying to indicate with that line that he holds that mystical \"International Notary\" designation that Charles Holmes was babbling about at his trial. As an International Notary he is not subject to the rules of the Society of Notaries Public of British Columbia. Ron Usher told me that there is no such thing as an \"International Notary\" so I'm assuming the Chief just made it up\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nby notorial dissent � Sat Nov 30, 2013 9:59 pm\nEven assuming, arguendo, that the First Nations actually do have such a position, they would only have authority to notarize within the tribal community and for tribal members, so whoopee!!!\n\nThere is no such thing as an \"International Notary\" so he is indeed making it up. So again, big surprise. NOT!!!\n\n__________________________________________________\nThese are alot of lawyers and/or some legal folks whom work in or with Law Society in British Columbia, i have met one who works closely with them and has been used in cases. They do not believe our original nations are separate, they think we are all Canadian, we are all subject to their rules of law like a Subject of her Majesty. What do you think, are you or are you a citizen of your own nation ? Where do you stand ?",
