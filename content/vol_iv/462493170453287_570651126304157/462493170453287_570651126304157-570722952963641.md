   "message": "Gold is a particular annoyance of mine , I'm sick of hearing how it's value sky rockets and it's the best thing since sliced bread. Sliced bread as it turns out has more intrinsic value , the irony. Gold has NOT sky rocketed in price, your money IS just worth less. If/when money collapses lets see what good your room of gold does you compared to my room full of food, you may even like to exchange me some on whatever day you would like me to laugh in your face the most :D",
