But on Tuesday, the day Amy Collins was supposed to be sentenced at provincial court in St. John�s, all was quiet.\n\nAmy Collins, shown during her sentencing hearing Oct. 11 at provincial court in  St. John�s, had a warrant issued for her arrest Tuesday after she failed to show up for her sentencing.  � Telegram file photo\n\nThat�s because she didn�t show.\n\nAs a result, a warrant was issued for her arrest.\n\nThe 36-year-old � who had been released on conditions after she was arrested in September � was convicted of obstructing justice and breaching probation Oct. 11 following her trial, in which she refused to take part.\n\nCollins refers to herself as a human rights advocate and while she denies being a member of the Freeman on the Land movement, her beliefs are similar in that she refuses to heed  government rules.\n\nDuring proceedings in her trial, Collins continuously shouted objections and insisted that the judge call her �My Lady.�\n\n�I do not have a name,� she told Judge Mike Madden. �I have a calling.�\n\nShe constantly interrupted the judge, prompting him to find her in contempt of court. Sheriff�s officers were called and Collins was led to the holding cells.\n\nWhen she returned, she still refused to go on with the trial.\n\n�Crown! I revoked your rights, as I am the only person standing in this matter,� Collins said.\n\nDespite her objections, the trial continued and Collins was found guilty of the charges.\n\nMadden issued the warrant Tuesday at the request of Crown prosecutor Mike Murray after a half-hour wait.\n\nAs of court closing time Tuesday, she still was not located.\n\nrgillingham@thetelegram.com\n\nTwitter: @TelyCourt",
