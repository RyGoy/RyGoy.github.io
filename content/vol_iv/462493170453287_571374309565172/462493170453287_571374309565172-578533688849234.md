   "message": "Wether one goes to court in the capacity of accommodation party to administer the account (rebuttal and/or setoff) or NOM's and stays home and dodges warrants the result in most cases is the same...a lien on any assets attached to the person. Sure it's generally a joke going to court as is also not going and dodging warrants, both end the same...lien on person and person assets. I personally go watch the show, then come home and paper their paper with paper...as long as the collateral they want to lien including your body is a security interest held outside of the person there's not much for a hungry tiger too do.",
