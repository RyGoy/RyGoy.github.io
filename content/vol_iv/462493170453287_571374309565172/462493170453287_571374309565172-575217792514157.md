   "message": "Updated thanks to Pete's feedback; so just to encapsulate:\n\nScott Duncan: Replace \"the court\" with Wal-Mart. What would you do if you were told that you must show up for an employee discipline meeting (even though you have NEVER contracted with, nor work for Wal-Mart) and will kidnap you if you don't?\n\nHow would you handle that?  Calling the cops is useless.\n\nScott Duncan: If you are there against your will, then there is a meter running. SOMEBODY has to pay for that.\n\n...and if goons come to kidnap you... Kill them. It's fucking Wal-Mart.\n\nChip Douglas: \"If you are there against your will, then there is a meter running. SOMEBODY has to pay for that.\"\n\nYESSS, i remember reading somewhere where you said something to the effect that, at some point the Accountant will come down to find out whats going on because- SOMEBODY has to PAY for all this!...dont give them ID, dont give them the NAME-of-the-PERSON, its all about surety, and its all about Accounting - thank you Scott Duncan, oh yeah...and where there must be Accounting, there must be a contract",
