   "message": "HAHAHA...James, I went there once by\"special appearance to settle a matter\".  Ha, I even went through the Point of Order!  If you want to make a plan to go that route, go for it, it's not my decision.  After I REALIZED that there was NOTHING good that would come out of me \"standing on my rights\", I chose to Notify them of a Mistake.  They chose to issue an Arrest Warrant for this person they have in their custody already (Still puzzling me really).  So I issued ANOTHER Notice of Mistake to let them know EXACTLY what was going on and further, I demanded that they send CERTIFIED COPIES of EVERY document they have that makes them think that I am SURETY.  \n\nI made my choice and here I am typing away from the comfort of my home.  All I can share is MY experience!\n\nSo, you can stand on \"Theory\" or \"Practice\"....your choice!",
