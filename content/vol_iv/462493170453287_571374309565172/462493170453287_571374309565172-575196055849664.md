   "message": "Chris, did I ever say I go to court to settle the matter, or did I suggest I would go there for something otherwise?  Only the person or someone having a representative capacity for the person whom the Crown is coming against has standing the settle the matter.  How can one say there is a mistake but then proceed to settle a matter that doesn't pertain to him?  Can I settle a matter for you without having some type of representative capacity or similar?  They will know you by your fruits.",
