   "message": "Chris, why would you go to court to settle a matter that doesn't pertain to you.  Why would you say anything concerning the subject matter of a trial for some entity you claim is not you and you have nothing to do with?  Would you also try to settle a matter for a trial for Ronald McDonald or perhaps just let them know that nothing that happens at that trial better result in a violation of your rights?  ;)",
