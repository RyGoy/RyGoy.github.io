   "message": "inter alia (in-tur eh-lee-ah) prep. Latin for \"among other things.\" This phrase is often found in legal pleadings and writings to specify one example out of many possibilities. Example: \"The judge said, inter alia, that the time to file the action had passed.\"\n\nAnd for clarification, no!!!  I shall not PLEAD with these criminals!  Pleading indicates you are in ACQUIESCENCE to the PROCEEDINGS.  The Notice of Mistake is issued BEFORE the PROCEEDINGS!!!!\n\nMan, the more I dissect your paragraphs, the more FreeDUMB shit I am finding.   :-)",
