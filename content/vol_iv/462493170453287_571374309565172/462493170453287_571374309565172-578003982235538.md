   "message": "Wow. I apologize. I had NO idea they lied like that. Looks like it's time for an article. :D\n\nA \"Bench Warrant\" (There's no such thing. This is slang) like EVERY warrant, has an EXPIRY DATE. No matter what lie is told here. Warrants MUST BE RENEWED BEFORE EXPIRY, or they expire (DuuuH!). \n\nIf the warrant is issued by 32 Division in Toronto, and it's \"Canada Wide\" the warrant has accrued costs. RCMP charge for the \"service\" of reporting on warrants. If the warrant expires, then the Police Division who requested the warrant, has to foot the bill.\n\nThey can keep renewing, but the bill grows. If it gets TOO big, it gets the wrong kind of attention. If the RCMP decide they need to EXECUTE the warrant themselves, they can take over. Now even MORE costs are attached to it, and they want YOU (The Person) to pay the bill.\n\nThat's why warrants \"appear\" to be \"forever\".\n\nRead ANY legal paper on warrants. They MUST have an expiry date. they are the same as a TREASURY BOND.",
