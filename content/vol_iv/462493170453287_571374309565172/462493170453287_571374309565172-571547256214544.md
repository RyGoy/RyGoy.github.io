   "message": "And to Adam, you were not allowed back in because your \"controversy\" was missed, you were allowed back because it appeared you actually wanted to learn. \n\nPicking fights with people is disruptive to the learning process. And you don't just post singular inflammatory comments, you post them in sporadic clusters that can drag an entire thread into mindless bickering. \n\nYou were booted once before. If you TRULY want to be here, how about you start acting like it? Work on that \"listen-more-than-you-speak\" thing. Start examining your comments before posting and assess whether or not this is RELEVANT information that you're sending out. \n\nHave you said it before? \nPossibly numbering into the double-digits?? \nDoes it contain no actual information, but something off-topic or directed at someone else personally and may incite conflict???\n\nIf the answer is yes, this makes it unnecessary to post!",
