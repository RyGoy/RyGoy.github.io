   "message": "Scott Duncan, I agree with  your \"theory\".  However, there is \"in theory\" and there is \"in practice\".  That is where the problem lies because, in practice, if you don't attend at the Walmart hearing, notwithstanding having advised Walmart you are not one of their subjects, the Walmart goons will deem you to be a servant of Walmart and come and throw you in a cage.  Unfortunately, \"in practice\" trumps \"in theory\" :(",
