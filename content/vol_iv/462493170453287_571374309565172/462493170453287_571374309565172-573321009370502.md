   "message": "\"(even though you have NEVER contracted with, nor work for Wal-Mart)\"\n\nThis might sound crazy...but i would then send 'WAL-MART' the Terms-and-Conditions of MY employment-contract then with WAL-MART: Id like to make $100, 000/year, an unlimited expense-account, my own parking-spot, a corner-office, have every Wednesday off to break-up the work-week, one week of vacation every month, a two-hour lunch-break,  a company-car (Dodge Charger), and a hot secretary i can bang whenever i want without ever getting in trouble for breaking some corporation by-law\n\n...do you think 'WAL-MART' would go for that?",
