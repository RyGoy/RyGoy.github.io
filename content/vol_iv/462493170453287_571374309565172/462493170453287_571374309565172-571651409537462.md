   "message": "Well, what is the thing they are prosecuting or processing for profit ? Its a piece of paper, might be bond paper but its paper. So, what is wrong with writing in a contract for the piece of paper your using, keeping in mind it does not belong to you, you didnt create it. So, if you wanna throw in the Notice of Mistake along with a performance contract by all means, dont sit on your ass while they do paperwork as well.
