   "message": "from:What Really Happened!!!\n\nI am glad someone finally came up with a number because this is a statistic I have been searching for a very long time. And from the daily dose of wrongful police shootings being reported, this number looks to be fairly accurate. \n\n That means more innocent Americans are being killed by the police than by terrorists, even including those killed on 9-11. Where is the corporate media coverage on this threat to innocent lives? 3 people died in the Boston Marathon bombing and it was non-stop coverage for days on end! The same with Sandy Hook, where 26 people died. None of the SSRI-crazed shooters waved at us by the gun grabbers ever killed anywhere near as many innocent people as the police do, yet got headline coverage across the land. \n\n We decry the slaughter of innocent Palestinians by the IDF only to find we have the exact same crisis here, quite possibly because of all those Israelis being hired to train the US police departments. \n\n The corporate media failed to report on how vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they are supposed to prevent. The corporate media failed to report that there are serious problems with GMO crops. And to that growing list of cover-ups we can now add that the police kill more innocent Americans than terrorists do.",
