   "message": "If you go thru insurance you have accepted liability for an accident and made them equitably responsible for damages, however you are still personally liable for any offences incurred while having an accident.\nThe policy enforcement guys generate revenue by taxing you with said offence and charging you for it.  They always try and assign liability at the scene of the ACCIDENT. By Establishing Fault.\nThe PO PO are a third party who have no business there, unless you consent... If you use your insurance and registration they have a right to be there to check on their legal title property.\nYou still have the right not to contract with them, at any point along the line. The only right you have ...\nYou are still liable to the injured party... which is not the cops..",
