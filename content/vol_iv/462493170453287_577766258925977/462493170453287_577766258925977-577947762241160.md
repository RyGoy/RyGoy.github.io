   "message": "I know right... Remember not even say 6 years ago, if you got into an accident you would never get a ticket on top of it. My dad fell asleep going to the lake driving his new mustang. He hit the ditch car rolled and he was flung out the rear window. He was so lucky that he didn't hit anything. He was really bruised up and cracked a couple of ribs. Some people called 911 and the police gave him a ticket for careless driving too. He was more pissed about that than wrecking the car cause he hasn't had a ticket in 25 years...",
