   "message": "So, this is likely a stupid question but I need to get it straight in my head. \n\nScenario: You get into a car accident and there is damages to a vehicle (not a PERSON)... so the policy enforcement send you home on foot with a ticket for \"Careless Driving\", valued at $400 or so. \n\nWould this be something you can and/or should fight? Or as Scott always asks, \"is there an injured party?\", would this be deemed as an injury? It seems to me that the complaint is issued by the Crown, not the injured party ï¿½where the damages would be handled by your insurance.",
