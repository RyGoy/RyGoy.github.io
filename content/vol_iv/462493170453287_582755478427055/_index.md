   "message": "Greetings Warriors!  I wanted to share how I removed my car from the registration matrix of the corporate State of California.  It was very easy to do (�so easy, a caveman can do it�).  We know the matrix is full of adhesion contracts.  I heard various ideas on how to skirt the system which required forever covering the VIN (never do this); but none included actual removal from the matrix, no one knew how.  I didn�t want to skirt it � I wanted totally out.  [EDIT: What I mean by removal is cancelation of the contract and not receiving any further offers to contract.] A close friend already had a US DOT number plate, and covered the VIN.  So I did some research, which I love to do. [US DOT = United States Department of Transportation (federal)]\n\n \n\nFirst, I obtained a US DOT number and had a plate made, which says at the bottom �Not for Hire�; it is not �registrant only� because I did not know about the US DOT number until after �registrant only� was phased out for new applicants.\n\n \n\nSecond, when I received the corporate Notice of Registration Renewal (offer to re-up the contract) I returned the corporate state�s property (license plates) to the DMV by priority mail flat rate envelope to its headquarters in Sacramento � not the local branch.  I mailed the plates along with an Actual and Constructive Notice letter, the renewal notice with �cancelled� written diagonally across the face and the last registration certificate to a living natural person in charge of registration operations.  I located the DMV directory containing this information.  The \"Reader's Digest\" version of my letter: I specifically detailed the DMV codes relating to registration and the various related definitions from the code along with the one that says in the event of a federal definition, the federal trumps the state.  Then I buried the coffin with the federal definitions.  I told them in light of the fraud, the DMV was directed to update their records to reflect that my VIN refers to a private car that was not involved in commerce and therefore not a type required to be registered.  Also the addressee would be held personally liable if I suffered damages at the hands of �revenue officers� due to non-compliance with my instructions.  I signed it �All Rights Reserved, 1-308� above the signature. \n\n \n\nI keep a copy of the letter and evidence of mailing in my car glove box.  Haven�t received any response (not that I expected to) and it has been several months.  The DMV here sends out [late] notices [and penalty fees] when you are delinquent with registration.  It�s that easy once you know own what you know.  I�ve helped two friends (including the one with the DOT plate) do the same.  This information is hidden in plain view; you just have to know it�s there.  He who does not know his rights has none.  I cannot recall where I found bits and pieces of the puzzle posted online that contributed to my education on the how, but I am forever thankful and grateful to those kindred spirits.  I hope this helps those who may be searching for a way out.  [I researched using what is freely posted on the net as a guide and composed my response. Your state may vary . Check out famguardian.org, sedm.org, 1215.org, state-citizen.org, freeinhabitant.info, smileyjharris.blogspot.com, and search the Sovereign Warriors forum; these are just a few of the resources where you can find information. ]",
