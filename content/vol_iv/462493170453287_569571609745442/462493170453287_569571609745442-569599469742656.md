   "message": "Seems authentic especially since I have been thinking the same thing is happening today by the political right. One nut job of theirs is Michele Bachmann who recently said she believes \"We're Living In The End Times\" (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/michele-bachmann-end-times_n_4060063.html)\nI have heard and seen other RWs who really believe it too.\n\nIn a way it is... FOR THEM.\nYou see, this may be the end of their belief system but we are not there just yet.\n\nI truly think they have been creating world crisis' to force destitution so people will be broken and needy, then seek help from religion. It is the old \"create a problem so religion, government, monarch etc. can HELP\".\n\nIt is one thing to be fooled and everyone is susceptible. That shit happens all the time but one must wonder when ignorance is combined with dogma in a fragile mental state, how to treat people like this.\n\nMichele Bachmann requires serious mental help. She may come around after the fall but there are many more just like her that will very likely fight even after the fight is over.\n\nI am not violent however shooting a cow for having mad-cow disease is more of a preventative measure but more so, mercy. Mercy for her and all of us.\n\nHow say you?",
