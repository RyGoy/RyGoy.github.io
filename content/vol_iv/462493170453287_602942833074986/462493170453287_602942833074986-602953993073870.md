   "message": "ohh love of doge. Scott can you share the best place to join a pool and/or P2P pool. My only hardware at the moment is my low powered notebook capable of around 28 - 30 khash/s. It seems that on all of the pools I look on for the doge that I am by far the lowest powered machine. I am currently at the dogehouse pool. The dogehouse website suggest using p2p pool can you elaborate on why that is better - or not?",
