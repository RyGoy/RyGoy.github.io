   "message": "Alright now : Hi everyone !\n\nThat video was a great watch. Even though the root of the content I had it pretty well figured out already, I will definitely watch it a second time to make sure I didn't miss too many bits - I know you're never done learning and that's one of the reasons I was invited here I guess ;) - but I was glad to realize my personal views of what MONEY is and what it SHOULD BE, which many people in \"finance\" \"economy\" and such think is \"ridiculous philosophical nonsense\", are shared and - more importantly - much better understood by some people who are obviously wise enough to help me bridge a few gaps and clear a few shady areas of things I thought I understood pretty well already...\n\nThis group should be a great place ;) \nGlad to be around ! Cheers everyone !",
