   "message": "STAYED=They can just sign a piece of paper and it's real again. Similar to WITHDRAW. STAYED charges means the account is still \"open\" but dormant.\n\nWITHDRAW means they must file again, but they may use the same material.\n\nI won't give LEGAL advice, but I ALWAYS OBJECT when charges are STAYED or WITHDRAWN.\n\nDISMISSAL is the ONLY acceptable motion, as far as I'm concerned.",
