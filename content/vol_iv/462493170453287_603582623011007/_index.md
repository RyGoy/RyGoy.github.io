   "message": "YES I GOT ARRESTED...for fail to appear!...I arrived at the court house 12 min late and the judge signed a warrant for the arrest of DEAN KORY so when the 5 uniformed officers saw me ,they grabbed me! I went in front of the JP for a bail hearing and he remanded me into custody for 2 days and I was held at the Lindsay Jail for a bail hearing this morning where I argued that I could not possibly \"APPEAR\" even if I was there on time...the court information read \"fail to ATTEND\",the charge reads\"fail to APPEAR\" so I said \"if you want me to APPEAR than the inference would be that I must have disappeared first\" I was released with the fail to appear STAYED!",
