   "message": "I showed up late and the judge signed the warrant to have me arrested and when I got there 12 min. late...BAMM! they grabbed me.I was held for a hearing before the JP and he just passed the hot potatoe to the next JP the following day...I asked for access to my court materials and my voice recorder so I could record the proceedings and so they had to traverse me to the plea court to be seen by Judge Chester...Chester refused to let me have my recording device but allowed the documents and I was then put over to the next day...I went befor Madame Justice Ballhem and she argued with the crown about the reason given for the fail to appear...I told them that i was arguing subject matter jurisdiction  and the Crown offered time served if I plead guilty...I said I can plead guilty only of the facts and that I did nothing wrong...The crown then had to stay proceedings to avoid having the debate about the capacity issue!",
