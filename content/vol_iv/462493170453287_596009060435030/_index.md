   "message": "I propose a mission for anyone who is willing to do the research. Find out whom the Imperial Government is and what documents you can find on it, either online or scanned versions. What is the difference between Imperial and the Dominion of Canada. There appears to be a very significant difference and one took over the other without anyone noticing. One holds the obligations of treaties with all the original nations, the other does not but dances around like they do, a masquerade if you will.\nA group will be created in the next few days for this exact research to post up findings for anyone who take this up. I think uncovering a very big hushed up secret is about to be discovered. Anyone with documents or information lets work together.",
