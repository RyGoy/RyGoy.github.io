   "message": "I recall reading a white paper almost 20 years ago or so which addressed the greatest transfer of wealth to ever occur - from the boomers to their children. It suggested the need to intervene via stock market crashes and other means so as to leave subsequent generations almost powerless while scooping the the considerable wealth enjoyed by the boomers.  I suggest recent BAIL IN measures are part of this scheme. Finally, it addressed the potential of a massive upset of the populace and the need for stronger military rule - perhaps even the need for martial law. In my opinion, what has occurred over the past few years is no coincidence.",
