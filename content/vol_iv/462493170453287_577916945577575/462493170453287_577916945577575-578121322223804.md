   "message": "\"Its is duty paid to the creator of the currency...\nIt goes to the jurisdiction which it was paid in..\nTo use the currency is to be bound by its laws.\nthe queen doesn't sell stamps and has nothing to do with it.\"\n\nDuty implies a tax (fee) for crossing jurisdictional boundaries.
