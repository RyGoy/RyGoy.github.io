   "message": "Involving the authority of the UPU is automatically invoked by the use of postage stamps. Utilization of stamps includes putting stamps on any documents (for clout purposes, not mailing) we wish to introduce into the system. As long as you use a stamp (of any kind) you are in the game. If you have time, resources, and the luxury of dealing with something well before expiration of a given time frame, you can use stamps that you consider ideal. The most preferable stamps are ones that are both large and contain the most colors. In an emergency situation, or simply if economy is a consideration, any stamp will do. Using a postage stamp and autograph on it makes you the postmaster for that contract.\nWhenever you put a stamp on a document, inscribe your full name over the stamp at an angle. The color ink you use for this is a function of what color will show up best against the colors in the stamp. Ideal colors for doing this are purple (royalty), blue (origin of the bond / commercial), and gold (king�s edict). Avoid red [I believe this incorrect, that it should say \"black\", red is the color of blood and since time immemorial a covenant signed in blood is the highest form of Contract known to men. - Rick] at all costs. Obviously, if you have a dark, multi-colored stamp you do not want to use purple or blue ink, since your autograph on it would not stand out as well if you used lighter color ink. Ideally one could decide on the best color for his autograph and then obtain stamps that best suit one�s criteria and taste. Although a  [\"Red Fox\"] dollar stamp is best, it is a luxury unless one is well off financially. Otherwise, reserve the use of [\"Red Fox\"] dollar stamps for crucial instruments, such as travel documents. The rationale for using two-cent stamps is that in the 19th Century the official postage rate for the de jure Post Office of the United States of America was fixed at two (2) cents. For stamps to carry on one�s person for any kind of unexpected encounter or emergency use, this denomination might be ideal.",
