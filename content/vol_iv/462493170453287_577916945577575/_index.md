   "message": "Sorry to bother�.\n\nI think I understand this SUPRA PROTEST thing correctly :D ? HELLOOSSSS!!!!!\n\nWhen the person I happen to have in my pocket, receives a Bill of Exchange, I, as a Man, can SUPRA PROTEST that bill of exchange correct ?\n\nSo now a MAN, which happen to be �ME�, is FULLY responsible for that debt :D ?\n\nAnd as a MAN, I can use LAWFUL currency to clear that debt ?, since that these Note is LEGAL tender are for PERSONS :D\n\nNow, LAWFUL currency, mmmhhhh, I have good reasons to believe that POSTAL STAMPS is LAWFUL currency, since that APPARENTLY, it is backed by gold, I goolged that for 2 weeks now, and CAN�T get a clear answer�..Help please ??\n\nBut if I am right, which bring this matter hypothetically, and I fucking hate that, but hey�..gotta start somewhere, I, as a man, can use this LAWFUL currency to clear that debt.\n\nNow, what�s a $1 postal stamp can mean in LEGAL tender bank notes ? I guess I am the one who will make this decision :D correct ?\n\nAnd why should I also use this stupid $0.05 postal stamp on this bill of exchange ?, would it be fair to say it�s to say THANKS to Elizabeth of the House of Windsor ?, because without her, I could not do that SUPRA PROTEST, as a MAN. ?\n\nSo, as a man, whatever the LEGAL amount should be, I can and have the right to MATCH it with this $1 LAWFUL currency postal stamps ? :D , unless there is a CONVERSION chart somewhere :D\n\nOf course that bill will become NON-NEGOCIABLE, NON-TRANSFERRABLE, WITHOUT RECOURSE and RETURNED COMPLETED.\n\nWHO could REFUSED that kind of debt discharge ?\n\nThanks\nPete",
