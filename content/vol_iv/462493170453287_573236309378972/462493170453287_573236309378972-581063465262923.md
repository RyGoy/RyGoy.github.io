   "message": "When you apply to vote (or for your PERSON to vote), you are granting power to someone else to represent the PERSON...hence in Australia's parliament, there is the Senate & the House of Representatives...ie the people appointed to represent the citizens/persons...\n\nIf you applied to vote (as/for/on behalf of the person), I'm sure there would be a record somewhere.\n\nOtherwise, you would have appointed yourself to administer the person's affairs, no?...\n\nBecause we didn't comprehend these things back then, isn't that a big part of the reason we are liening the name now, to claim it from the government, so that it can be governed in accordance with our own wishes, without interference from third parties & interlopers?",
