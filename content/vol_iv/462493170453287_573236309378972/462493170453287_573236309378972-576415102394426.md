   "message": "Scott, i came across an interesting Maxim: Use is a fiduciary ownership. Interesting in that i have heard the term 'fiduciary ownership' used in relation to trust law. But i cant find a definition for fiduciary ownership even in a Black's Law 9th-edition. If you havent covered it already, could you give an explanation as to what 'fiduciary ownership' means in relation to trust law? Thanks.",
