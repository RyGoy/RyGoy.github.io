   "message": "The best 'kind' of gold digger...in contrast to Kanye & Jamie Foxx's encounters... :P (I'm unqualified as to assess the 'best' gold digger, that's a too general/relative for me to speculate) \n\nScott is the Creator ie: he already knows where the gold is...he lays that stuff down, but can only respond when 'we' find the nuggets & ask the right questions: :D\n\nSo, in my estimation (using this analogy), Scott isn't so much a gold digger as a jeweller & geologist, who either confirms whether we have found a nugget or if it is just a polished turd pulled from the arse...when 'we' uncover a nugget, he explains why it has value, how to maximise its value, and as a geologist, he leads the way in demonstrating where to find more of these nuggets and how to avoid the turds.\n\nRight, that's the end of my messed up analogy, but I hope you get the sentiment...in plain language:\n\nGood find Derek Moran, thanks Scott Duncan for the education :D",
