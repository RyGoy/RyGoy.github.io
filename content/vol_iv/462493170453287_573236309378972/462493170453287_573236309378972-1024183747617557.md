   "message": "I owe you a lunch for that :) \nMind you; I have recently found out that many who have the same mentality as 'the pack' were actually kicked out of 'the pack' \n\n--> those removed are intelligent, not-so-ignorant men like you, who have alledged much fucktardiness within 'the pack'.  It is also made up of of ex-military, police --- Need I say more? \n\nSo, I retract my 'but the kids are our future we can reprogram them' crap, but I'm sticking to:\n\nthese people are fucktards who, after crossing my empathy levels, deserve to be torched with as much *love* as possible. \n\nI'll use love. I don't want some cop lover to call the SQ or Army saying they are in danger because of what I wrote on FB....or DO I?? Much fun can be had. I think I'll need a bit more VALUE first.\n\nI would be lying if I said I am not scared that as a woman, the intimidation tactics they would try on me would mooooore than likely be just a tad more aggressive compared to those they tried on your landlord, franki.\n\nI know this because, well, you know my story with the G.I. robocops:/",
