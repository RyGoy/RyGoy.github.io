   "message": "Ok, there's a lot of gold in this thread...I'm playing catch up here & had a few thoughts percolating around in the protoplasm re the following:\n\nChip Douglas: ...I've noticed Scott where you've said something to the effect of, \"Sending an Affidavit of Affirmation (to the Registrar General it was i think), pretty much covers YOUR obligation.\"\n\nRegarding the 'Affidavit of Affirmation':  Is it being sent to the public trustee (whether it be the Registrar General, Dept of Births Deaths & Marriages etc, depending on the jurisdiction)?\n\nRegarding the contents of the Affidavit:  Is the purpose/intent of the affidavit to revoke the power of attorney granted to the public trustee & inform/notify them that a new POA/trustee has been appointed, namely the Corporation?\n\nThanks :D",
