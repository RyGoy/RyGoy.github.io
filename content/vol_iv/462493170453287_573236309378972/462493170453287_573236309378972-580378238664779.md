   "message": "I went to the Registry of Deeds yesterday looking for a public record.  Upon inquiring the woman told me that there are only a few counties left in Mass and that Essex was \"voted out years ago.  It was on the ballot.\"  Out of curiosity, I asked if I wanted to register a valid UCC claim on property other than a deed or real estate, where would I do that and she said they \"still accept those.\"  She went further and said \"they report to the Secretary of State now\".  I interpreted that to mean that they are only a corporate subdivision now.  \n\nThat looks to me as if the bell curve of our rights slipping away is happening and we can't even see it.",
