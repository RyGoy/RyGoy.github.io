   "message": "You've probably noticed Scott, that under CONTRACT in Black's Law 9th, there are alot of variations of 'contracts' given. Following up on the conversation we had regarding 'Fiduciary Ownership,' i was looking over the section regarding everything FIDUCIARY in Black's 9th, and just spotted a form-of-contract that seems to have been placed all on its own separated from the rest all under CONTRACT:\n\nfiduciary contract: Hist. An agreement, by which one party delivers something to another, on condition that the second party, will return the thing, to the first.\n\nIs the Birth Certificate a 'fiduciary contract,' Scott?",
