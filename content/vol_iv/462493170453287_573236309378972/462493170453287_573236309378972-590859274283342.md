   "message": "Derek, why are you so fascinated with WALMART RULES/WORLD? \n\nDo you LOVE Walmart's services so much, that you pick into every decision their BUSINESS does? Do you do this , because you fantasize of being on their private meetings, and want to impress them with how much Walmart bullshit you know? Besides being obsessed with Walmart, do you have time to study for things that will help in REAL LIFE?\n\nHow many times  Scott has warned us about not being deceived by Walmart/\"Clubhouse rules\"?\n\nBesides that it has been stressed MANY times by Scott that \"WE ARE NOT PART OF THE CLUB\" (that by itself should had taken care of the issue) here is one of the most important reasons, if not the most, to stay away from CLUBHOUSE RULES: \n\n<<TRUST LAW IS THE HIGHEST LAW. DON'T SELL ITS VALUE TO LOWER LAW!>> Scott Duncan  \n\nUsing a very bad analogy:\nCLUBHOUSE RULES =You get raped, and death by the will of strangers, and nothing you can do about it. \n\nTRUST LAW = You get to slap your cock in the faces of strangers that try to rape you, and get to shoot, and kill them at will. Smokes weed afterwards.\n\nSo, if one is going to invest time \"studying\" \"laws\", Derek, which one will you fucking pick?\n\nJust hit the reset button! :D",
