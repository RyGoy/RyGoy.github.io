   "message": "According to some (Bill turner from NZ in his videos, and possibly Marcus, but don't quote me on that), we attorned when we applied to vote: \n\nie: When we reached the age where we could legally administer our the PERSON's affairs, by applying to vote, we (as in the man signed for/as/on behalf of the PERSON, effectively asked the government to represent the PERSON instead of self administering...in effect, granting a power of attorney to the public trustee.\n\nThis is a reason why, according to my comprehension, that it is futile to protest as we asked to be represented in the first place, so by then opposing/protesting against the person's representatives, a controversy is being created.\n\nIf we wish to administer the PERSON's affairs/estate, then this is a mistake or appointment that needs to be revoked/corrected.\n\nIf this is a shitstain on my part, I request Scott Duncan to berate and/or correct me accordingly...I'm not ready to kill myself just yet.",
