   "message": "Scott: OK, so here in REALITY you need help with the TRUST aspects.\n\nWhen you create a LIMITED LIABILITY CORPORATION, you and the Governmaent are acting as GRANTORS - This ends upon creation and the GRANTORS have no further say.\n\n1: A coprpration has SHAREHOLDERS who are the BENEFICIARIES. You determine the number of shares when the corporation is chartered, ans YES you can have ONE SHARE in a corporation. Ammendments to the charter can change this.\n\n2: A corporation has DIRECTORS with titles (TRUSTEES), and you can be one. You have surely seen \"Voting Shares\" when examining share purchases of a corporation. If not, you need to invest more.\n\n3: Since YOU (Or rather your PERSON) are the only VALUE in this corporation, you should be SECURED. \n\nTHIS TRUST TRUMPS ALL GOVERNMENT CLAIMS.\n\nAs part of my \"God Complex\" I shall now grant you permission to ask about what I just wrote.",
