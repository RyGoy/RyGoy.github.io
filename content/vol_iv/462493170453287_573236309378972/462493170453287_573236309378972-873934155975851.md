   "message": "Redemption / Strawman / Bond Fraud\n\nProponents of this scheme claim that the U.S. government or the Treasury Department control bank accounts�often referred to as �U.S. Treasury Direct Accounts��for all U.S. citizens that can be accessed by submitting paperwork with state and federal authorities. Individuals promoting this scam frequently cite various discredited legal theories and may refer to the scheme as �Redemption,� �Strawman,� or �Acceptance for Value.� Trainers and websites will often charge large fees for �kits� that teach individuals how to perpetrate this scheme. They will often imply that others have had great success in discharging debt and purchasing merchandise such as cars and homes. Failures to implement the scheme successfully are attributed to individuals not following instructions in a specific order or not filing paperwork at correct times.\n\nThis scheme predominately uses fraudulent financial documents that appear to be legitimate. These documents are frequently referred to as �bills of exchange,� �promissory bonds,� �indemnity bonds,� �offset bonds,� �sight drafts,� or �comptrollers warrants.� In addition, other official documents are used outside of their intended purpose, like IRS forms 1099, 1099-OID, and 8300. This scheme frequently intermingles legal and pseudo legal terminology in order to appear lawful. Notaries may be used in an attempt to make the fraud appear legitimate. Often, victims of the scheme are instructed to address their paperwork to the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nTips for Avoiding Redemption/Strawman/Bond Fraud:\n\nBe wary of individuals or groups selling kits that they claim will inform you on to access secret bank accounts.\nBe wary of individuals or groups proclaiming that paying federal and/or state income tax is not necessary.\nDo not believe that the U.S. Treasury controls bank accounts for all citizens.\nBe skeptical of individuals advocating that speeding tickets, summons, bills, tax notifications, or similar documents can be resolved by writing �acceptance for value� on them.\nIf you know of anyone advocating the use of property liens to coerce acceptance of this scheme, contact your local FBI office.",
