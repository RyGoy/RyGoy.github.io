   "message": "Interesting that you bring this up Jay Le B. I came across Alberta's Perpetuities Act by mistake looking for Ontario's.\n\nAlberta's has in it this line right at the top:\n\nHER MAJESTY, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, enacts as follows:\n\nOntario's Perpetuities Act, does not.\n\nAlberta's Perpetuities Act includes these definitions:\n\n (b)    �disposition� includes the conferring of a power of appointment and any provision whereby an interest in property or a right, power or authority over property is disposed of, created or conferred and also includes a possibility of reverter or resulting trust, and a right of re-entry on breach of a condition subsequent;\n\n (e)    �power of appointment� includes any discretionary power to transfer a beneficial interest in property without the furnishing of valuable consideration.\n\nOntario's Perpetuities Act, does not.\n\nI get the gist of what Scott is trying to tell us in terms of \"It's ALL Clubhouse Rules\".....yet it seems very strange and peculiar that there are these omissions in Ontario's Perpetuities Act compared to that of Alberta's...almost as if there is intent involved in Ontario's trying to conceal something from us",
