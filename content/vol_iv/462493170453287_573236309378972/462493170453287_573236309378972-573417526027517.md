   "message": "Since you are in Quebec Pete Daoust, this should help:\n\n the TRUST FUND is understood in the civil law as property owned by NO ONE. There is NO title holder. The trustee and the beneficiary both have PERSONAL RIGHTS as against the UNPERSONIFIED trust fund: the trustee to DISPOSE OF and MANAGE the fund, the beneficiary to OBTAIN ENJOYMENT. The only OTHER solution open to the civilian is to DESIGNATE the trust LEGAL PERSONALITY, so that the trust ITSELF OWNS the TRUST FUND, and the trustee and the beneficiary have RESPECTIVE RIGHTS within the PENUMBRA(?) of that personality and its OWNERSHIP.",
