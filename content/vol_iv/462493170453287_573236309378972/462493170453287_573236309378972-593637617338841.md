   "message": "Some thoughts on the ingredients of my eventual Affidavit of Affirmation:\n\n1. Mr. Registrar General, you gave my mommy and daddy a BC to hold for me soon after i was born\n\n2. Im over 18, adult, ascertained, and capacitated\n\n3. Didnt perish in The Great Fire, Absented-from-my-Estate, gone Lost-at-Sea\n\n4. Im the Object-of-the-Trust  >  'a people'/the beneficiary\n\n5. NO IMPLIED CONSENT to being an AGENT, just because im holding a valuable security that wasnt created by me, come get it and give me what i was meant to get then if thats a problem for you ;)\n\n6. No 'Instruction Manual' was ever given to my mommy and daddy to pass-onto-me on just what was to be done with the Birth Certificate upon my turning of the Age-of-Majority, to the best of my knowledge (it was a long time ago, and i WAS pretty young- i just dont remember)\n\n7. Section 29. of the Ontario Financial Administration Act says/talks about how the Lieutenant Governor in Council may provide for the manner of executing security certificates\n\n8. How about 30 days to respond?\n\n9. Barring any objections, of course\n\n10. Received your FIDUCIARY CONTRACT\n\n11. Received your Scrip Certificate\n\n12. Send me a copy of any RESTRICTIONS ala section 56. of the Business Corporations Act",
