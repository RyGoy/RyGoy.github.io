   "message": "Yes....but maybe I am thinking too much about this.  I am not comprehending how it is actually done.  So lets say the Grantor expressly states the Trustee has to pay the Beneficiary 8 BitCoins per week.  The Trustee (as any good trustee should do), takes the appropriate FRNs and turns them into BitCoins and deposits them into the account of the Beneficiary.  Is that considered \"Taxable Income\" by IRS standards, as the Trustee IS a creature of the State?  Or is that Private Trust Business and counted as an expense of the Trustee?",
