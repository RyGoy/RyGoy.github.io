Stop making shit-stains and pulling crap out of your ass.\n\nJOHN SCOTT DUNCAN was created by 2 \"Citizens\" and ratified by the government, and GIVEN to ME.\n\nI DO NOT CONSENT, AND WAIVE THE BENEFIT, but it is still \"mine\" because I am the only VALUE to this constructive trust.\n\nI AM NOT A PERSON, I HAVE A PERSON, but it's NOT MINE. I cannot claim it outside the jurisdiction.\n\nI CREATE A PERSON named ROGUESUPPORT INC, who ACTS AS TRUSTEE and SECURES the name for MY benefit, in a TRUST.\n\nNotice that there's no \"trustee in the common law territory\" or any such bullshit. It really is that simple.\n\nSTOP\nMAKING\nSHIT\nUP!",
