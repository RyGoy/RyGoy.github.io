   "message": "Chris Evan Is King James' version of the bible better than the other peoples version Adeola?\n\nScott Duncan Yes! That is the one OFFICIALLY ENDORSED by the Nobility! It is their OFFICIAL book of your imaginary friend.\n\nScott Duncan It even NAMES the guy scamming you! OTHER Bibles don't do that!\n\nScott Duncan Accept no immitations!\n\n The KING JAMES Bible still has the best parts! Slavery and Rape are STILL OK! It's STILL OK to sell your daughter as a sex slave. It's still ok to kill those who don't believe what you do.\n\nPLUS the KING JAMES VERSION IS THE OFFICIAL version! Accept no imitations. Get the REAL book about the imaginary sky-daddy made for you by strangers so they can take your shit!",
