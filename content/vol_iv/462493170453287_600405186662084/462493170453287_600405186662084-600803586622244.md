   "message": "Lol, that is pretty funny Kent; but I have to point out you are referring to silver's value PRE fiat currency collapse. THe truth is one will be buying houses for 40-50 ounces of silver when the fiat illusion crumbles. Think about it. The buying power of currency is so low because the markets are flooded with it. You cannot flood the market with something that is physically limited. The price of things relative to limited available money adjusts itself accordingly. just look to history for the proof ;)",
