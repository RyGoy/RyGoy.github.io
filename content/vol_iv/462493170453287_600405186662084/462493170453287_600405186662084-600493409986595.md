   "message": "I personally have no faith in currency; including bitcoin. My faith will forever remain in MONEY; which from my understanding is a PHYSICAL store of value. Gold, Silver, precious and semi-precious stones, commodities, etc. Why you ask? Simple: Be a dear and go and print me an ounce of pure silver bullion... Oh you can't you say? Silver is PHYSICALLY LIMITED you say? Well then; sounds like MONEY to me... ;)",
