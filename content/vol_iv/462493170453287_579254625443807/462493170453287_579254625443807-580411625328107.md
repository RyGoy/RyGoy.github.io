   "message": "I recall reading that during the Occupy protests, the phone companies worked with police to thwart the protestors. They (police and phone companies) created zones where messaging/testing abilities were disabled so protestors couldn't communicate/organize.  I believe the term for this kind of activity is referred to as \"geofencing\".",
