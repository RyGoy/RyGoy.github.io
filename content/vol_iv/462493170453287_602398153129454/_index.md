   "message": "Scott on How-you are BOUND by ACTS, STATUTES, and CODES when you use MONEY/LEGAL TENDER- thread.....\n\nTHE TENDER FOR LAW is an examination of what you need to know to fight Judicial corruption, by examining the stuff you are LIED TO about.\n\nSPOILERS: IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT ACCOUNTING AND SURETY.\n\nYou are BOUND by ACTS, STATUTES, and CODES when you use MONEY. On that money are the words THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER:\nTHIS NOTE - The note the words (NOTICE) is written on.\nIS LEGAL - CODES, ACTS, AND STATUTES with the force of law.\n\nTENDER - tender verb\nten�dered ten�der�ing\nDefinition of TENDER\n\ntransitive verb\n1: to make a tender of\n2: to present for acceptance : offer \"tendered my resignation\"\nintransitive verb\n: to make a bid or tender\nOrigin of TENDER\nMiddle English tendren, from Anglo-French tendre offer\nFirst Known Use: 15th century\n\nTHIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER=THIS NOTE IS A TENDER FOR LAW\n\nThis forum is where you can ask all your questions, and we don't have to keep typing the same answers over and over. To that end, I am telling you to WATCH THIS FIRST:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/3P7izAUe3ZM\n\nNOT watching this, and then posting a question and/or making idiotic statements which reveal you HAVEN'T watched this, means you are DELIBERATELY ignoring these instructions, and you will be banned.\n\nPost your question, we will do our best to answer. OFF TOPIC POSTS WILL BE PURGED. We want people to be able to use this as a central reference and a place to go for help, where people will take the time to do so.\n\nPost any questions on LAW, MONEY, CONTRACTS, and JURISDICTIONS and how they are connected.\n\nKeep it civil, even if Scott doesn't. (It's Scott after all. Seriously, it's better than paying him) Remember that Scott chooses his words carefully. LEARN WHAT THOSE WORDS MEAN.",
