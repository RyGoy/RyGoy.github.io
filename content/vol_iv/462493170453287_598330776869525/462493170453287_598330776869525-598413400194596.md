   "message": "if I understand it correctly, PIERRE creates a trust with Pete as beneficiary. Pete is the current administrator of PIERRE. Since Pete can't be seen in commerce and therefore  can't enforce anything, Pete must register a new person(9111-1111). Pete gets to be the first director and PIERRE gets the VP spot. PIERRE is just getting an office and a title and duties as Pete sees fit only because he is a silent partner. Pete as first director directs 9111-1111 to lien PIERRE for his commitment amount.",
