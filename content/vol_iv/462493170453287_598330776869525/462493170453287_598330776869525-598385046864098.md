Just because we can deflect surety does not mean we are still not bound in some way to name,\nAt birth by law.  Until you lose it, you will not know how much was taken.    You will not know. You have no gauge to tell. It has been systematically beaten out of us as LEGAL PERSON with given Name (title). Create a new title that is not bound to the law of their creation, you get to create your own� Your rules- their legal person parked in trust,  You will still get to administrate if it is that much fun for you :-P\nAll administrated under a title of YOUR creation, you rule your self� without outside attachments�  :-D\nIt is FREEing�",
