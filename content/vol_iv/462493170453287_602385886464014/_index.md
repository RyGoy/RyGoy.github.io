   "message": "THE TENDER FOR LAW PRESENTS: ALL THE SHIT THAT DEAN KORY IS DOING WRONG!\n\n...AND NAZIS!\n\nOk, that's a bit of an overly dramatic title, in as much as the courts don't actually follow their own rules any more.\n\nStill though... You still get Nazis, so there's that.\n\nJust because they don't feel like following the rules, doesn't mean we have to be �scumbags� like them. I listened to all the audio recordings that Dean Kory made of his hearings (time I'll never get back, so you fucking owe me, dude!), and I feel it's important for me to correct a few key points here.\n\nI know all of you get your information from multiple sources, ranging from the Grand-Poobah of the Free-Dumb Movement, Robert Menard, to Dean Clifford, to Winston Strout; and maybe it's just self-aggrandizement, but I like to think I'm the only source that tells you the truth instead of just orbiting it. As with many things in life there's �more than one way to skin a cat�. However, one of the worst things you can do is �mix methods�.\n\nDean Clifford and I are at exact opposite ends of the scale. Dean's name is Trust property, thus giving the man that you know as Dean Clifford a great number of options the rest of you don't have. He doesn't use the Trust like a bank machine, he doesn't abuse any of the authority that any Trust title gives him, and he has the personal knowledge that he's not on his own if he has to �get the fuck out of Dodge�. That's where the consensus ends amoung us.\n\nDean's teachings on Trust Law are accurate, concise and accessible. For some reason it's worth it for him to give everything he teaches those qualities.\n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI'm not a super-genius, and I don't possess any mental powers that you don't. Any discussion and/or engagement with me starts off with the reality that you ALL THINK WRONG, and YOU ALL VALUE THE WRONG THINGS! This does not serve you when you are up against reality.\n\nThe sad part is that most of you are too old to change; and as I've demonstrated here in this little forum, none of you can tell the difference between what's true and what feels good. I know what you're experiencing. Whether from Dean, or from myself, the time always comes when you read something that one of us writes and you KNOW that it is true; but you take no further time to understand what is being told to you.\n\nFortunately Dean Kory has provided us a working/living example of what happens when all of the above factors are in play.\n\nThe first obvious mistake that Dean Kory is making is that he is combining what Dean Clifford teaches with what I teach. For the purposes of this article I'm going to dumb the two positions down so you can make the comparison.\n\nDean Clifford is all about being left alone, and when he's not left alone, he is about calling �them� to account.\n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI am descended from the very people that put all of this in place. Entire stereotypes about Scottish people exist to misdirect. Most will tell you that Scotsmen are �cheap�, when in reality we are conservative about when we engage in commerce. You have but to look at England's and Scotland's history to see why this is true.\n\nThe very name of this group, THE TENDER FOR LAW, is all about that mysterious phrase, �THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER�.\n\nI'll be the first to admit there are a great number of benefits to be enjoyed in commerce, when everybody plays by the rules. As I'm sure everyone is sadly aware of, by now; Nobody is playing by the rules anymore.\n\nTrying to �fix the system�, or call them to account in their own system, is simply �appealing to your rapist�. It baffles me that anyone would think this is sound thinking.\n\n...I digress.\n\nAs I'm in a unique position to �follow the money�, I can determine who needs to pay the price for the royal screw-over we've been given. As I type this, a team of system's engineers (and trained monkeys) are preparing for you, the reader, a step-by-step guide for cleaning out every financial institution that touches these shores. The only price that I ask for this knowledge is that you pass it on to others. Pay it forward...and get paid at the same time. Who else offers that shit?\n\nI am many things. I am prorogued Nobility. I am a published author. I am a composer. Above all...the thing that forms the core of who and what I am, is that I am a computer scientist. Those who have taken the time to actually listen to me, will recognize many �Scott-isms�; and the phrase �COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING� is repeated almost as often as my Number 1 �Scott-ism�, �THE MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG.� You ignore these two truths at your own peril.\n\n...and reality does not care what you �believe�.\n\nThis lengthy preamble is to drive the next point home.\n\nDO NOT TRY TO COMBINE DEAN'S METHODS WITH MINE.\n\nThere is no remedy in fraud. There simply isn't.\n\nIn many ways I long for the old days where those who breached the PUBLIC TRUST were hauled into the street and thrown into an angry mob. Authors have mistakenly used the term, �Hanging Judge� as a term for a judge imposing strict penalties; but if you look through actual history, and not the crap you were taught in the Public Fool System, �Hanging Judge� refers to a judge who has abused his power and has been hung for the abuse of that trust. He gives sentences he should be hung for; HANGING JUDGE. You never hear the phrase �hanging JUSTICE� This is odd, as there are so many of them. ...I know. Digressing. I get it.\n\nWe don't have Judges any more, in Canada. A judge traditionally was a trusted individual who could uphold the PUBLIC TRUST. �We the people� no longer get to decide who is worthy of that trust. People confuse the role of �judge� with the current role of �JUSTICE�. It is important to know the distinction.\n\nJUSTICE is actually a �doing-business-as� name for a Crown Corporation. It actually says, in the Dunn and Bradstreet listings �Government of Ontario Operating as JUSTICE�. It has been like that, IN VARIOUS FORMS, since 1982.\n.\n..I'm sorry you missed it.\n\nThat is what you're dealing with, and you have ONE unalienable RIGHT; THE RIGHT NOT TO CONTRACT.\n\nMy position is a lot closer to that held by Irene Gravenhorst, than it is to Dean Clifford's.\n\nSo, let's cover what Dean Kory is doing wrong!\n\nI notice a lot of �Clifford-isms� in what Dean Kory is clearly attempting to say; but all of Dean Clifford's methods depend on what I like to refer to as �Clubhouse Rules�, and every time you do this you're pretending to �be in the club�. The natural response to somebody doing this is very similar to the response to somebody saying they know more than I. In case you haven't noticed I smack them down in the most humiliatingly, and public way possible. �Their� reaction is going to be much the same...we're all human after all.\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE (like the cheese) stands alone.\n\nIt is the only issue you should be concerned about! NOTHING ELSE!\n\nSERIOUSLY! Accepting discussion about anything else, is a FUCKING NEGOTIATION. All of you are not seeing the forest through the trees. This is why I say Dean Clifford's position is flawed. He believes the tree can be pruned to look pretty again, when in reality it needs it's roots burned out, and it's limbs chopped up for one of Sir-Mica's gassifiers! The fucking tree is dead!\n\nUNDERSTAND?\n\nThe tree is dead!\n\nIt's filled with parasites and rot, and the parasites are trying to keep the illusion of a tree standing. For the past two years I have been feeding them the rope, at my own expense, and with violence inflicted upon me, so that any argument contrary to my position is immediately nullified. IT IS/WILL BE, CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE that you are NOT getting what you are entitled to, given the burden of surety you have carried!\n\nUnlike THE MAJORITY of your �sources of truth�:\n\nI'm not one of these people that wants to drive without a licence.\nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their mortgage.\nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their taxes.\nI DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE I FUCKING PROMISED TO!\nI am, however, someone that possesses knowledge and skills that the government finds/found essential to their expansion. In my youth I gave our erstwhile government a tool, which all of you pay the price for today; and I was rewarded handsomely. I patted myself on the back, and strutted around, knowing that I was smarter than everyone else, and never once paying attention to the harm I had caused.\n\nIn compliance with an oath I took a long time ago, I must atone for that; and that's the only reason you, the reader, even know that I exist.\n\nI need to remind you again, that the only reason I'm here, is that I promised to be.\n\nNone of you have value to me. You're not qualified to.\n\nI have a lot to teach you, and we are barely getting started; but I am not responsible for the shit that goes wrong when you try to take what I teach you (�REALITY�) and you try to jam it into your idiotic, unqualified, belief structure. As I write that sentence I wonder how many of you have actually pondered that other �Scott-ism� you frequently hear; �ALL BELIEF IS EVIL.� If you believe something, you will stop questioning it; you will stop investigating it, and you will never ponder if, and why, it's true.\n\nShould you believe something, that just happens to be true, you won't look any further � and that's a problem.\n\nSo I want everyone to keep the following in mind. All the sources you are investigating tell the truth about the law, but there are pitfalls!\n\nEverything Robert Menard says about the law is true. It's what he doesn't say that's the lie. If you want quick confirmation of this simply ask him what, �This note is legal tender� means. If he tells you the truth (he won't), ask him why he's constantly �begging� for that very same TENDER FOR LAW that contains the ACTS and STATUTES that he claims don't apply to him! THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER is a TENDER FOR LAW. If you BENEFIT, then you have OBLIGATION!\n\nEverything Dean Clifford says about the law is true, but how he chooses to apply it, is not; because there's still a lot of �belief� running around in his head. He still believes he can �beat them at their own game.� He will proudly point out their public and blatant violations... His evidence is irrefutable and conclusive. His rights are violated by those TRUSTEES of the PUBLIC, and then he tries to seek remedy from those same trustees! REALLY?\n\n...and then says the remedy, is to go to those very same people and �sue� them..in the very same courts that violated his rights. (What?) ...Oh that's right, those are DIFFERENT courts, with DIFFERENT\n�Doing business as� JUSTICES. (WHAT?) ...well, I'll just let you work out the flaw from there. If you can't, then you are too stupid to be reading this, and you should kill yourself.\n\nFeel free to try it this way. It's NOT �wrong�, but it ignores the fact that those who hold the PUBLIC TRUST, ARE wrong. Another �Scott-ism� is my position that NONE OF YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S TRUE AND WHAT FEELS GOOD! Following Dean Clifford's methods WILL drive this point home, so it's not a COMPLETE waste.\n\nWell then...back to Dean Kory.\n\nRumour has it, through the grape vine, that the erstwhile Mr. Kory has been and/or will be, a guest on Global C.R.A.P. Radio, hosted by the redoubtable Tony �guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth� Butros. This promises to be an exciting show, and I cannot wait to miss it. I eagerly anticipate the thrill of not consuming time I'll never get back.\n\nInstead I'll put something useful here � advice for your next court room appearance, Mr. Kory.\n\nWhen you're in the court room dealing with these babbling, sacks-of-shit, learn to use the breaks. Repeat after me, �I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS�. If they ignore your question, then your next response should be, �OBJECTION. If the court cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.� Keep repeating that, and repeating that, and repeating that...until they answer your fucking question.\n\nI listen to you in court, Dean Kory, and I picture a girl screaming rape while slipping the condom on the rapist. I notice the distinct lack of that phrase in ANY of your recordings, so repeat it in your head, �Objection. If you cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.�\n\nApply THE TENDER FOR LAW Rule to this. I choose my words very, very carefully, because I know what they mean. You, the reader, seem to believe there's a library in your ass, because that's demonstrably where you keep pulling your answer out of. If you see me using a phrase that should be used in court, the very first thing you should do is follow my rules. Look up every single word, even, no scratch that, ESPECIALLY, if you THINK you know what the word means. As the regular reader for THE TENDER FOR LAW will tell you, you most certainly don't.\n\nDean Kory reserves his rights, and then doesn't know what the fuck to do with them; but that's ok, because there are plenty of other people in the court room that know what to do with Dean Kory's rights.\n\nOne thing Dean Kory should learn is that he is most certainly not Dean Clifford. Make no mistake, it doesn't matter if I disagree with Dean Clifford's methods. The fact is, I understand them. What Dean Clifford is doing is beyond your current level of comprehension. He is not joking when he says that everything he says and does, is part of a larger plan. I disagree with Dean Clifford's position and methods, because he pays too high a price for the sake of worthless people; but he's doing it for all of you, and not just for himself. I will admit statistically, this does skew the numbers in his favour; because in the end, Dean Clifford is like you. You all think wrong, and value the wrong things.\n\nThe only difference between you and Dean Clifford is that some of the things he values ARE the right things.\n\nWe are all doing this for different reasons.\n\nRobert Menard will try to scam you out of every cent you have by telling you the truth...because he thinks you deserve it. You're the Mafia wife, the enabler, and he rationalizes that he's not taking anything of any value from you.\n\nDean Clifford sees that you're all asleep, and he values mankind as a whole; but like Mary Croft before him, he's beginning to realize that everyone prefers �lucid dreaming� to actually being awake. The time he takes pandering to that crowd robs him of time, and returns nothing.\n\nMy position is blatantly self-centered. I was born with a title I didn't choose. I was sold to the government, and warehoused for McMaster University because it turned out I was smarter than everybody...and apparently that's a crime. When I began to call all parties to account, they spared themselves by making certain promises and offering certain concessions and entitlements, which they no longer honour.\n\nMy aim is to misbehave.\n\nLike Robert Menard, I want you to suffer for your ignorance, especially if you've come to me before. I want to wield what I know against those who would dare seek to harm me and those that I care about; because all of you are walking a path now, and none of you realize it's a one-way trip. You all want your freedom, and my position is, �Be careful what you wish for.�\n\nAs you all think wrong, and value the wrong things, so it is unlikely you could possibly know what to do with freedom. If you find yourself making that one-way trip, through that hole in the fence, remember that on the other side, are people just like me.\n\nAll of you are welcomed to believe whatever makes you feel good. Martin Sutton's belief, for instance, makes him feel good, and he identifies it as the core of who he is; and all I can think is, �This is what happens when evil has consumed an extraordinary man.�\n\nALL belief is evil. Martin Sutton is incapable of evil, so the belief sits there like a parasite, taking this man's good qualities and giving them to �Jesus�.\n\nAt this point I can classify Martin Sutton as belief's �best-case-scenario�.\n\nBelief is taking not thinking and making a virtue out of it.\n\nAll of the people from whom you seek knowledge are extraordinary in their own way. However, reality doesn't care about these things.\n\nI certainly hope this effort gets Mr. Kory focused on what's important, but the reality is, all of this is a symptom of a much larger problem.\n\nWe're all running out of time. I don't know if anyone has noticed the professional name-callers have been labeling people who point out the truth as �conspiracy theorists�, while at the same time publishing the inane babbling of actual conspiracy theorists. This method is much like Americans putting people who hire hookers on sex-offender registries, thus removing any distinction between a guy who indulges in a rent-a-fuck-toy experience, and the Scarborough rapist. Because none of you understand the exponential function, you couldn't see the bell-curve of your rights being whittled away.\n\nBefore I end this article, let's take a little walk through Canadian legal history.\n\nAt this point in legal history, the Criminal Code pretends to be the Common Law remedy, bestowed to an administrative zone of a sole proprietor CORPORATION called Canada...but this wasn't always the case.\n\nI'm going to presume that you don't have knowledge of the Canadian Bill of Rights. I freely admit this is not a reasonable presumption as Dean Clifford never shuts up about it (I swear that guy jerks off reading it).\n\nOne of the most protected rights in that bill of rights was Freedom of Speech. Under the Bill of Rights �offences� like hate speech, blasphemous libel (yes, that's a criminal code offence � look it up), and �uttering a death threat�, would not be possible.\n\nThe UK Canada Act 1982, better known as �The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms�, includes a �notwithstanding� clause. This gives the elected representatives of an administrative zone's constituency the power and authority to say, �Fuck off, that's just stupid,� to any Federal Statute. The closest a province has ever come to using this was on the �gay marriage� issue. Everyone's entire government had just been privatized, and their biggest concern appeared to be whether two dudes can marry.\n\nI look at events like this and sometimes I can't help but think, �Maybe Menard's right. Maybe you do deserve it.�\n\nAnyway, while you were all in a tizzy about whether a dude can wear a wedding dress and be taken seriously, other more sinister machinations were afoot.\n\nHis name is Ernst Z�ndel of Regina v. Z�ndel fame, and his story went something like this:\n\nErnst Z�ndel is one of those ideological pustules on society that invariably erupt when free speech is so vigorously protected. I've read what Mr. Z�ndel has to say, and he cites reliable sources to support his position. This ignores the reality, and other evidence, that counters his position.\n\nWhat's more reasonable to accept?\n\nThat the holocaust didn't happen? Or that Roma (gypsies), the mentally ill, the handicapped, the Muslims, the Jews, the homosexuals, and the political dissidents, were all rounded up and exterminated; and the Jews just whined about it the most. People doing stupid things at �crime scenes� don't help, and support idiots like Mr. Z�ndel. With only a little, tiny bit of probing, you will discover this fun fact regarding the holocaust. Those smoke-stacks on Auschwitz were built in 1947 for �dramatic effect�; and when pressured on it, every holocaust memorial foundation grudgingly admits this is true.\n\nBut back to Mr. Z�ndel....\n\nErnst Z�ndel was doing the Streisand effect, before Barbara Streisand made it cool.\n\nAfter the constitution was ratified, parliament quickly set about whittling away your free speech rights, and Ernst Z�ndel happened to be in the right place at the right time. No one knew it then.\n\nNow Ernst Z�ndel is a hateful little man; and he wants the world to know it. So much so, he decided you could avail yourself of his opinion by calling up his �976 Hate Speech Hotline�...for the low, low charge of ten dollars appearing on your phone bill, you could injest all the hate-mongering that would fit on an answering machine tape (Yes, a fucking tape. That's how long ago this shit happened).\n\nPeople called up and he actually profited from being a hateful little man...and if the story ended there, you could reasonably think, �Fuck this is Canada. You can do anything�, and we'd all live happily ever after.\n\nAfter a couple of months of profiting from people with more money than brains, rumour of this great scam eventually fell on the ears of a Jew. See? Mel Gibson was right. Jews are always causing trouble. Well it came to pass, that this great scam did fall on the ear of a Jew, and attached to that ear of a Jew, was a Jew with a finger, which could dial a telephone; and for the bargain price of ten bucks...he could make history!\n\nI freely admit that I wouldn't pass that shit up, so there's no way a Jew's going to. Remember the stereotypes kids, and be advised that Jews come to Scottish people to learn humility.\n\nDo you guys see how many stereotypes I've managed to jam into here so far?\n\nAs the result of this hilarious chain of events, Mr. Z�ndel became the dubious winner of the �First Man to be Charged with Hate Speech� prize. Under this �code� Mr. Z�ndel's position was indefensible, but he had an �ace up his sleeve�. He had studied the constitution and believed he had the right to do what he did. His lawyer, probably another Jew, saw dollar signs rocketing all the way to the Supreme Court, so he grabbed onto the Law Society's tit and sucked as hard as he could. This case plodded through the courts relentlessly, and ended up at the Supreme Court where they freely admitted that all hate speech laws are, by their very nature, unconstitutional. However, Nazis are �bad� so they decided to remove that right and blatantly ignore anything the constitution has to say, with an addendum pointing out that each administrative zone (province) has the right to exercise that �notwithstanding� clause nobody's ever dared use.\n\nThey'll save it for something important...like dudes getting married to each other. I say dudes because I refuse to accept the proposition that hot girl-on-girl action is NOT a human right.\n\nThese events marked the beginning of the slippery slope of rights removal all of you are just discovering now. It has been happening for a very long time.\n\nMuch has happened since the Z�ndel case. The public is slowly spoon-fed ridiculous concepts. The United States slipped even faster using our �enlightened� hate-speech laws as an example. Now there is a perfectly �legal� �War on Terror�. Americans are so stupid that they don't even realise they're making war on something that's not even an noun. �War on Drugs� at least meets the �noun� criterion. If you had to defend the �War on Drugs�, it's only defense would be, �At least we're making war on a noun.�\n\nI'll let that sink in.\n\nHow many stupid �Patriotic Americans� don't realize there's a war on something that's not even a fucking noun. If I think you don't deserve to live for not realizing that, imagine how low you rank in the eyes of those who created this policy � all \"perfectly legal\".\n\nWe need a Monarch dictator for a generation, to bitch-slap you back to reality. For, one of the other things that I don't hide, is the fact that I, and other privateers, commissioned the AQUILAE TRUST with the primary mandate: To assist in the restoration of executive power of the Monarchy, under the terms of the AQUILAE COVENANT.\n\nThree generations ago, Princess Elizabeth called to the then recently-released slaves, to help her stop the Empire from being wiped-out by the Germans. And she is of German descent. That war left a legacy that is priceless. It formed the corner stone of civilization and brought us into a new Golden Age.\n\nThe laws of commerce work when everybody plays by the rules, and when everybody's rights are respected. For three decades I have screamed that this is not happening.\n\nSo I have set out to prove it to you. My goal is to show you all that there is no deception. They're just not playing by the rules any more. The people responsible for your chronic ignorance, jumped ship long ago. Now we're stuck with parrots and chimps, running a mighty, but decaying, infrastructure.\n\nJust remember this is on an exponential curve too.\n\nI am doing my utmost to construct a lifeboat, and to detach you from all this. What I am constructing (to paraphrase Q from Star Trek) has wonders to satiate all desires, both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.\n\nHere is my court room position in a nutshell.\n\nYou do not accept surety � EVER.\n\nStep 1: Reserve all rights. (get Derek Moran to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)\n\nStep 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed. Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS. If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.\n\nAnything outside of this supports their position that you are �playing� their game, and thus it is presumed that you understand the rules. The only way to counter this is to declare that you CANNOT UNDERSTAND the rules without these questions being answered.\n\nThink very carefully about this. If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling\nand its rules, you might raise the obvious question, �Why do you get to move two pieces?� If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?\n\nIf you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that's when you're going to �understand� that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game. You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert.\n\nNovice drivers and expert drivers all have to follow the same rules. You don't get to ignore rules because you suck at them. Just as my chess board is not a chess school, the court will not allow the presumption that you being a novice is a lawful excuse. The only method to extract yourself �with honour� is to accept responsibility for the mistake in presumption. They are presuming something wrong...and you are acknowledging it's your fault. The court must accept this MISTAKE, and your entreaty for forgiveness for the unintended debt created. The court MUST do this.\n\nYour name should never come into it. Your name is but a piece of evidence in a much larger presumption that the court has the right to attach a name derived from a public document, to a living man. This, of course, is untrue. The court knows it's not their right. That's why in the Mary Croft days, the quote �living man� argument worked. But these are trimming at the branches of the poisonous tree in an attempt to make it look pretty. The only solution is to target the root. The root is accounting and surety; there's no farther to dig down.\n\nYou have all heard the quote, �I am not a number. I am a free man.� This came from the profoundly subversive British television series, The Prisoner, which exposes the Noble Lie in the most blunt and obvious way possible, without using the actual words. If you take the time and watch this series, you can see very clearly, knowing what you know so far, exactly how everything is. The protagonist, played by Patrick McGoohan, who truly supports the concept that acting is an art form, is only ever identified as �Number 6�. The highest ranking officer in the prison is only �Number 2�, whose character keeps changing; none of them ever answering the constantly-posed question, �Who is 'Number ONE'?�\n\nAnd...because I fucking-love giving away the ending...\n\n�Number ONE� turns out to be a delusion of the protagonist's own making, whom others around him exploited; all to answer the question, �Why did you resign?� I want you to think about that as you go down this path.\n\nYou will be pursued by the people you once served, and you will be asked, �Why did you resign?� To answer is to become �salvage�. You never learned why �Number 6� �resigned�, because his position is what your position should be as regards government.\n\nNONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS!\n\nIf you want to be even more hostile reach for a �Scott-ism�, FOR WHATEVER REASON OFFENDS YOU THE MOST!\n\nSo there's your homework. Read this article over, and over, and over again. Just so there's no confusion, I am communicating on several levels here. Whoever is reading this, pay close attention to what I say.\n\nThat's it.
