   "message": "I suggest they become their own bank, keep a useful amount of legal tender so their corporations can pay bills that require it, or use a bitcoin atm to withdraw what you need and invest what you don't instantly need back into bitcoin. This could be very interesting because they will have to pay everything with cash...many places won't accept cash\n\nAny other suggestions?",
