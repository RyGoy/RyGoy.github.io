   "message": "A friend has a situation where he rents a room in a home. The other tenant whose name is on the lease was told in court that my friend is ordered to move out of the home. There was nothing given in writing to any parties related to the order. My friend was told by the other tenant about the order (would that be hearsay?) . Apparently the order said he must be out today and stay away for 6 months. \n\nFor this order to be valid, should he not receive it in writing as opposed to hearing it from a 3rd party? If there is nothing in writing how would he be able to rebut the offer made by the court? My thoughts are that the administrative process would be a valuable tool for him to use, but he has nothing but hearsay to respond to. \n\nI appreciate any feedback :)",
