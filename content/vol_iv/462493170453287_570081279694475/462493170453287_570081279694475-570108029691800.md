   "message": "The child who originally filed the complaint does not even live there...I think the situation was she was living away, got into financial trouble, came back home, made a complaint to CAS and moved out shortly after that. There are 2 still at home the oldest is 12...my understanding is the 12 yr old tends to be a bit defiant but told CAS she doesn't fear my friend ...she doesnt like his or her moms rules, but not fearful of being harmed",
