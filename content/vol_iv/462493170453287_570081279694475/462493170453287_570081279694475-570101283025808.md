   "message": "So, on the presumption the child is unsafe to live in the current conditions with this male friend of yours... \n\nHow is the child's safety deemed to be in jeopardy?\nand who is making that allegation?\n\nIf the order is directing the parent/guardian of the child to evict him, there is no need to serve your friend directly but certainly should receive an eviction notice and compensation upon exit as he is a victim of the circumstances.\n\nTo me, it sounds as though the court advised to remove your friend from the premises and as an ultimatum to be later assessed. Perhaps that is why there is no paperwork. \n\nOn the other hand, this could be BS to break the sublet?\n\nDifficult to determine any responsibilities without more details.",
