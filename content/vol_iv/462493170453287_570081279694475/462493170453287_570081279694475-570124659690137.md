   "message": "If it is an actual order, there is paper. Have whoever the order is directing call the court to request a copy. There will be a lot more evidence to make a better determination at that point. Also, was there a discovery? The accusations of the complainant must be included and that may give some understanding? A transcript can also be requested, of course.\n\nBeing a child who was torn away from my hysterical mom in family court, contrived by Social Services, I can definitely relate but know I can offer little other than symbolic support.",
