   "message": "One of the most important things I would think is getting a copy of the \"statement\" made by the daughter as this alone is the driving factor. Any false claims or inconsistencies in that statement may be exposed and force \"their hand\". Create a debunk list from \"most damaging and untruthful\" to \"least damaging and hardest to disprove\".\n\nFrom that point, and this is where more of the TTFL crowd can chime in, I would think entering affidavits into the record, individually of the mom and Roommate or other supporters that will create the justice to doubt the original claim. Hopefully that would cause the justice to recant the order?",
