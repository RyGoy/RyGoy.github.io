In Korea it is a criminal act to steal food, clothing and other basics of life but if you are starving, dying from cold or missing any other basics that could prevent death,you are allowed to steal what you can to save your life. It's still criminal but not criminal at the same time.\nOh that story of Robin Hood comes to mind now. LOL\n[i really wanted to say low- quality Human like i usually do but I was writing to you] lol",
