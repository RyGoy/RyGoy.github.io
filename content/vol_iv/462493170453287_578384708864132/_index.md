   "message": "History: I'm home schooling my son and have been for years.  The government harasses me with contracts regarding the above. (SEE - Aldous Home School Form 2010 - web.jpg in the file section) They send me contracts and DEMAND that I fill them out ACCURATELY, sign them, and submit the document to them. THEY say this is MANDATORY. It�s obvious that they want me to be liable to punishment and, or other damages/financial penalties they may wish to inflict on me from time to time as they see fit. Reading their clubhouse rules, I realize that they might claim they have the AUTHORITY to remove him from my custody if they aren�t pleased with what he is learning, and or, should I FAIL to teach him everything they want me to.\n\nProblem: ^^ That SUCKS!\n\nDesired Outcome: I don�t want to be held accountable to a corporation that doesn�t have his best interest at heart, nor, do I want to be BOUND, and, or LEGALLY OBLIGATED to teaching him all of THEIR AGENDA. (He is only allowed to sing �OH HAPPYFACE SID LAND� in the morning, if he wants to). \n\nQuestion: If SCOTT DUNCAN received one of these in the post, how would he respond/proceed to achieve my goals in this regard?",
