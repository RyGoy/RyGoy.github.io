   "message": "I'm thinking that when F&CS and the police first came \"after me\", a number of ACCOUNTS were created. Once I was able to prove my claims in court and disprove theirs, an ACCOUNTANT approached many of those involved, and said someone has to pay. Hence the lost jobs, people demoted, and no promotions for a bunch of them. I'm guessing (half guessing as per other info from Scott and Shrout) that a few of the frontline soldiers didn't have bonds large enough to pay the BoEs they so quickly created without a second thought. They were all so quick to run to the \"poor girls defence\" without even asking me a question to verify her story. In the end, their misandry (the ease at which they were willing to attack me without any justifiable cause - other than I am a man and she's a woman) worked against them, and to my advantage. Side Note: Misandry can perhaps be employed to our advantage in an ART OF WAR kind of way. I could look at it as a means of generating some credit through the lien process. Hmmm.",
