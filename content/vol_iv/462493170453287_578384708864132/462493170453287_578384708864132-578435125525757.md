   "message": "I served in the CAF. Joined when I was 17 and was fully prepared and trained to kill a man, or many. At 21, I fought six cops on the corner of Queen and McCaul in TO. It took the fourth cop car to get me under their control. They don't scare me for my sake. Trust me. I'm a trained killer. :P",
