   "message": "As I understand, by registering his birth he became CARGO and a WARD of the QUEEN (not the lady with funny hats). The corporation claims I MUST (may = must) ensure through the NOTICE OF INTENT, that I will provide \"the child\" an education. By education, they mean their curriculum. It seems to me a bit more complicated because he is a child. I refused to submit the application once. I was threatened by a social worker to have Family and Children's Services notified that there is a concern that I am not willing to commit to EDUCATE him as per their curriculum. In the old days, they would allow you to teach a child what you want (think Mennonites). While they may still allow Mennonites to do this, by there actions regarding my son, us \"normal\" citizens don't seem to have that option.",
