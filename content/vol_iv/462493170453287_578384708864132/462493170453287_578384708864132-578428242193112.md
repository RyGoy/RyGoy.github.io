   "message": "I've said this before.... I am prepared to go to jail for my convictions. I just don't want my son to be disappeared. After his birth, he was dissappeared for almost 4 months and I wasn't allowed to see him. Took me that long to establish some privileges. Don't want to go that route again. My son shouldn't have to go through that nonsense. I proved them wrong regarding their CONCERNS and got some people in big trouble. But we can never get that time back again.",
