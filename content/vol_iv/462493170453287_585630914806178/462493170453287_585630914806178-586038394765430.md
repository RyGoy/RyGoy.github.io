   "message": "Most of these people are Satan worshippers, or other Gods. I believe love is the law, in theory but not in practice, but whose will? Under whose will? I have studied all of Edgar Cayce works when I was 19. A long time ago. Bible is still an interesting read. And everything else. I think Freemasonry practices these values, and worship Baphomet. Bottom line is all the religions and cults are all the same. If you can't blind them with brilliance then bullshit them with babble is their way of doing things. I got no use for any of them because they all do one very destructive thing and that is to divide us. Our laws reflect this.",
