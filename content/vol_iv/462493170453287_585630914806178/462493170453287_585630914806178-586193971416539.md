   "message": "Here's an excerpt Fred from the Trust Law book im reading, in regards to your comment- \" One day I will get what is mine. somehow.\"\n\n\"It was in Equity that the notion of the fiduciary was first conceived, and it originated to explain the position of one who AT LAW HELD TITLE and had all the APPEARANCE of full enjoyment, but who nevertheless because of Equity's intervention had NO right of PERSONAL enjoyment. Here was a man who had the capacity to bring every proprietary and possessory action available AT LAW, but who was personally LIABLE to another for all he did; a man whose rights were ONLY those of administration and DISPOSITION, and whose liability to another resulted in HOLDING even those RIGHTS ON BEHALF OF THE OTHER.\"",
