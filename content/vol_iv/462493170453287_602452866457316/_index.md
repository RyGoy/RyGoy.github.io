It shows you what we are building.\n\nScott Duncan You become \"valuable\" by USING THE MONEY!\n\nHow simple is that? \n\nScott Duncan It gets simpler. The problem is...THEN you get to see how dumb people REALLY are. People have fucked things up BIG TIME.\n\nIcbeonne Senama care to elaborate?\n\nScott Duncan HONEST MONEY IS THE GOAL! Make it WORTHLESS to banks (unless they want to play too ) and DEPENDABLE for YOU.\n\nScott Duncan I tried to fix CIBC in the 90's and turn it into something useful. I failed, but I got laid a lot, so there's that.\n\nIcbeonne Senama Funny! At least you tried...\n\nScott Duncan That's ALL I've done. 30 years, with some success, and LOTS of failures. I have lost over $27 MILLION in my efforts.\n\nScott Duncan This one's my last push.\n\nAfter that, I move onto genetic solutions.\n\nScott Duncan Basically if you aren't part of the monetary system we deploy... you die. Literally. Figuratively.\n\nIn 2 generations the people will be thinned out enough that we won't have the problems/damage that we do now.\n\nThere WILL come a point, where I say \"WAKE UP, or DIE\"... and I'll have something to back it up.\n\nThen people will use an HONEST money system as if their lives depended on it...because their lives WILL depend on it.\n\nScott Duncan What? Too creepy?\n\nScott Duncan Best get THIS one right then, hadn't you?\n\nBecause I WILL solve this problem one way or another. \n\nDerek Moran Just finished watching this.. think the most important words in it come at minute 37:47 - \"...made in the knowledge, that only rarely, does anyone ever ask, for REAL Gold...the REAL Gold was seldom CLAIMED, allowing fraudulent PROMISES(to pay) of GOLD(Bank of Canada-legal tender-promissory note-fiat money-bank notes), to be made and used as (so-called) 'MONEY'...\"\n\nDerek Moran \" I have lost over $27 MILLION in my efforts...This one's my last push.\"\n\n..how much will it cost to get THEM to honour PART V. of the Bills of Exchange Act 1985, CONSUMER NOTE/BILL/PURCHASES ?\n\nScott Duncan It's irrelevant. The damage is on a GENERAL Ledger somewhere. Why would I care. If I put a knife in somebody with the intention to kill them, and it WORKS...do I really care about the mechanics?\n\nScott Duncan BitCoin was deployed to prove the concept. Nothing else. It's not even scalable. Wait until you see what's COMING \n\nChad Brodgesell: Every thing is a promise to pay until you accept it as payment.\n\nI promise to pay you this cow for that chicken. Until the exchange is complete, it's Promissary.\n\nI promise to give you this $100.00 dollar bill for that Ipod.\n\nI would question not what debt is but rather WHO'S debt it is. If it isn't mine then I don't give a rats a** what it is. (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nChad Brodgesell: MONEY as DEBT is like the UCC, What do you care of it if you have nothing to do with it. Just my OPINION by the way. (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nChad Brodgesell: Ever hear about the Guy in Germany in 1930 something that went to the bank with a wheel barrel full of cash to deposit it. He turned to open the door and when he turned back Thieves had taken his wheel barrel, left the cash on the ground. (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nScott Duncan: It also covers the creation of DIGITAL currency.\n\nUse MATH instead of a \"central authority\".\n\nOne can only \"Believe\" in a \"Central Authority\".\n\nOne can TRUST math.\n\nScott Duncan: You are thinking properly, Chad.\n\nREMEMBER, the ONLY time you NEED money is when you are SPENDING it.\n\nChad Brodgesell: 'When do you need Money?' I took a tenth time look at it and come up with this.\n\nAll the money in the world and you still starve/freeze/get rained on whatever.\n\nYou NEED MONEY when You NEED/WANT something and Someone else has what You NEED/WANT but will only accept MONEY in exchange .\n\nThe action of the transfer of value is the SPENDING part. (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nScott Duncan The ONLY time you need money is when you are spending it. The rest of the time, its debt and obligation.\n\nScott Duncan I would like strippers to blow me every morning while I do my morning routine... We don't always get what we want.\n\nIF YOU HAVE VALUE, YOU SET THE TERMS. This has nothing to DO with the value of others (Which is what rent is).\n\nIf you need ME to do anything, you will need to pay me in BITCOIN. I simply don't accept anything else. If I get enough of them, I can exchange them for any other currency, at a VERY competitive rate, to pay for things of value offered by others. The only difference is that YOU use a different currency than everyone else.\n\nNo magic. Just jurisdiction.\nJuly 27 at 10:50am � Like � 5\nScott Duncan Remember when I said sometime back, that diving into this without understanding will reveal that you have no value? Well this is proof of that.",
