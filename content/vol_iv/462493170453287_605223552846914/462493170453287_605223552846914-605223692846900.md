CBC claims he had outstanding warrants and unpaid fines but this is NOT true as he was never convicted of any offense that the courts or police alleged against him.\n\nIf you believe that everyone has the right to freedom and pursuit of happiness then please join this page and let your voice be heard. Anyone who is a member of this page will be respected and protected by the other members as this is not about your beliefs but rather about justice and peace for ALL.\n\n:D",
