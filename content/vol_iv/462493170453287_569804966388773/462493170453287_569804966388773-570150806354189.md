   "message": "I tend to think wrong & value the wrong things...but now I'm going to think outside the box & backwards about how corporations create 'book' value in the current system:\n\neg: a mortgage company/credit company:\n\nBook value may be calculated by accounts outstanding + accounts received + cash reserves + other assets (plant & equipment).\n\nAccounts outstanding can be calculated as the book value of the mortgages they hold a charge/lien over.\n\nUsing this logic, (in the current system) we can extrapolate our value to be the charges & liens & amounts outstanding that we hold against others.  \n\nConsequently, we can borrow against the book value, money of exchange as & when required.\n\nSo, to borrow from Scott Duncan, 'you have no value'...is it reasonable to add to this statement 'until you create liens/charges against others' ie: salvage property abandoned on the 'sea of commerce' and/or the property of those who have caused you harm?\n\nIn other words, we add value by seizing value that already exists:\nie: pirates & privateers seize value as opposed to creating our own?\n\nIs this why we identify Captain Jack Sparrow, or have I just managed to create a massive shitstain here?\n\nIf so, that would be a mistake, so please forgive me :D",
