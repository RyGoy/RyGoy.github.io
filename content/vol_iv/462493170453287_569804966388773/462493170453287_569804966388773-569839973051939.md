   "message": "See... \nThis is where I get messed up, valueless in confusion.\nI know that to put a capital figure on a lien, a value needs to be established\nOne needs to to a skills assessment an Inventory.\nIn my case I go thru all of that and come up with a figure, but as I am explaining this to the Admiral on the phone a while back...  \nI get the Klaxon of wrong.... \nSo I reevaluate everything once again and have reached this exact point once before.\nI have some actions to take, I will have that nailed in a bit.  I am still pondering. I think about everything.\nI do need  some value ...\nThe skill set and wisdom sheesh... who can put a price on that...\nI'll tell ya who, accountants  :-D\nEvents are happening.\nValue is important but fucking how does one establish it... or is this the wrong direction?",
