   "message": "Scott, I am hearing a lot about this 1099OID form.  It is an Original Issuer form that is a statement of who created the money and is filed with the IRS.  If I write a check or sign a Promissory Note and never get the cancelled check back, I can issue this form to say I am the creator of X amount of securities (credit).  It is my understanding that these are filed once a year as a cumulative total.  Is this relevant?",
