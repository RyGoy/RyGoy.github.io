   "message": "So I spent the morning in Court today and got the opportunity to serve the Crown and the Court with my Notice of Mistake,I also included a photo copy of the birth certificate,my private I.D. and the receipt placed in my property bag by police after I deposited the B.C. with the Court Clerk at the status hearing months ago before Judge Chester.I asked the Judge\"In what capacity does the NAME exist as it appears on the information before the Court?\" and he refused to answer me,He stated that I was the \"Person\" on the information so I then asked what the Court's definition of \"Person\" is?..again no answer!He told me these issues can be raised at trial! I recorded everything but I wont post it because last time I was charged for publishing the court proceedings so I'll just wait and use this information in any civil proceedings if needed! I stated clearly to the Court that I can not proceed as I have been denied the chance to be made fully informed as to the nature and cause of the proceedings and unless the questions in my \"Notice of Mistake\" are answered,I would consider The proceedings to be in violation of my right to be made fully informed!",
