   "message": "Speaking of Bill Foust....he had a CIVIL DEATH of the Person and acted as Executor from then on in a Trustee capacity.  Scott also mentioned once about a Judge who killed JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN and Rick Carne mentioned a Civil Death once.  \n\nI am thinking that liening the NAME and holding it in trust accomplishes the same out come, but Foust's method would be in Trust jurisdiction.  Does this sound right....and why do some kill the Person instead of incapacitate the Person.",
