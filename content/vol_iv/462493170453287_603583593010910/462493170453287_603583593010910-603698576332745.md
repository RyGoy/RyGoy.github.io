The shit people are gonna get tomorrow morning were acquired 'By Operation of Law' - it will be GIVEN to them, a GIFT...meaning whatever they get means they didnt have to ENGAGE IN COMMERCE to get it. The stuff they will be buying for themselves for half-off on Boxing Day though, will be acquired by means of CONTRACTING with 'the LAW MERCHANT' ;)",
