   "message": "My rant on my page, made me wonder who here celebrates Xmas? Scott Duncan i would assume you dont because its a sky daddy celebration ?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI dont care much at all for CHRIST-MASS , i just really dont care to run around on a HAMSTER WHEEL ALL MY LIFE, over and over and over non stop, looping like a bad record. Does no one else wanna get off this ride that keeps going around, no one is sick of it ? If you were on a ride that kept spinning you im sure you could get sick. Year after year for the rest of your life your going to keep praising and celebrating these so called holidays ? Such a strange/odd and off way of living a life, at what point does one get tired of doing the same thing over and over, season after season, halloween valentines day, xmas, new years, st patty day, easter etc..etc...i sit back in aw of the HOLY F__k that goes on, all the guilt tripping if you dont spend spend spend. If you spent as much time worrying about this planet as you do about the gifts you will get or give, there might be a big change. All that effort in looking and wondering and shopping, could be spent actually leaning your rights and how to make some real change. Its all personal choice, free will and all. Just really surprising the amount of willingness to keep on keeping on there is in society. My rant on that, just because i dont follow any of those hamster wheel events doesnt make me better than anyone else, just exercising my own personal choice is all.",
