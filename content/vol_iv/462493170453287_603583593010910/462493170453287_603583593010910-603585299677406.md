   "message": "I HATE the stupid shoppers all running around, etc but I like the holidays because we actually stop everything to just be with our family and friends and visit. I use these holidays to remember to turn everything off (EVEN LEARNING) and be with the people I care about. That way I can extend what I have learned to them with our time together as well.",
