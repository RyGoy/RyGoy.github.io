   "message": "What I was wondering on serving and crafting notices is the time frame for responses. My guess is that it's just a courtesy period that allows the recipient to receive, respond and send back a reply. Or is there some kind of unwritten rule about how long you must wait? Which raises another question for me just thinking about it: is the silent response being an acceptance related to how consent works in a similar (if not same) way? I have too many questions haha",
