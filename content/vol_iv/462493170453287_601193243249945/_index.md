   "message": "Hello everyone,\nI am fairly new to the ideas of being a trustee of the legal person identified on the birth certificate, and administering the associated account to the legal person. I have been looking at forums, watching videos, and listening to radio shows for a while now. The biggest road block for me is that everybody says do your own research on topics but nobody gives a hint to where you can search for credible sources. Right now I am concerned with why notices and claims of rights are as effective as they are and the rules/mechanics governing their use. Anybody with insight and/or suggestions on where to look would be great. Thanks!",
