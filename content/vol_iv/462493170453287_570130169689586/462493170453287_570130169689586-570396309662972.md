   "message": "To further this idea, Can the current charges (Arrest Warrant) that the Court has against this Person be liened also?  Its my understanding that Courts are banks and they are salivating over this Security I created.  I have issued a second NoM for the resulting Warrant, but couldn't this be easier if I liened the Docket Number. became Creditor, and FORGAVE the charges? The only reason the Security they are trying to cash in on exists is due to my signature....so, what if I became Creditor of it?  Thoughts?",
