   "message": "I wrote to the DVLA (Dept responsible for issuing Drivers licences in the UK), asking if the licence is a form of ID (purely for shits n giggles n entertainment purposes only :D )\n\nTheir reply: \n\nDear Mr Sxxxx\n \nThank you for your email received on 18/2/13. \nYour email reference number is 1xxxxxx.\n \nI hope this information is of some help to you.\n \nThe photocard driving licence is not an identity card, its sole purpose is to convey entitlement to drive particular types of vehicles.\n\nBlah blah etc \n\nI used this in Australia to void a speeding fine (stopped at the side of the road, received the paperwork & mailed it back VOID no contract, with a Notice of Mistake & copy of the above email, stating that I have no knowledge as to whom they believe they identified)...and the licence was out of date.\n\nKey point from this for me, is that they acknowledge, via their email, that the licence has little to do with me as it is not used to identify me :D\n\nIf I then claim it, I don't know how much controversy I create by doing so...easier for the Man to step away from the PERSON...I have one in my pocket that seems to pacify the psycopath with the gun, but I'm glad that his bosses know that it's not ME :D",
