   "message": "OR, can I CLAIM this Account ab initio.  FUCK....Scott, my brain is about to explode. \n\nWhy are you seeking advice? - Because I want to grow and be in control\n\nWhat, specifically, is the problem? - Specifically, this Person is getting a lot of BoE's due to some presumptions made about the person, including an Arrest Warrant and some Traffic Violations\n\nWhat, briefly, led to the issue. - My lack of understanding of who I am and what the rules are have led to this, but I have become aware and would like to correct these MISTATKES.\n\nHow has the issue manifested, and what are the negative ramifications? - The issues started with a little arrogance.  I am in fear that I may end up locked in a cage or tied up....\n\nWhat is the desired result? - Certainly avoiding being locked in a cage and/or tied up.  But ultimately, I want all of this crap dismissed.  \n\n:-D",
