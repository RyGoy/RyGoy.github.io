   "message": "My understanding is if you're pulled over officers of a company will attempt to engage you in business contract and create an account. This account will however have debts immediately attached to it. They could call the account mickey mouse, point being if you say \"yes Im mickey mouse\" you're liable for the debts. Every encounter is a brand new possible business deal... Correct me if Im wrong obviously. I don't mean to mislead",
