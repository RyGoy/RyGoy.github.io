   "message": "I think the bottom line is, that if you're the only party that adds value to the PERSON (and from what I remember Scott saying elsewhere, EVERY time the name of the PERSON is used on a document/warrant/charge etc, a new PERSON with that name is created),  and the government is not a person, then who is going to object to you liening the value you have added to the PERSON into a private trust?\n\nBut, can you claim the value of the other PERSONs on the charge sheet/warrant etc?\n\nI think, from memory of other posts, that's also possible, especially once the original PERSON (BC) has been liened into a private trust, then all the descendants (derived from the original document) may also be liened into said trust :D",
