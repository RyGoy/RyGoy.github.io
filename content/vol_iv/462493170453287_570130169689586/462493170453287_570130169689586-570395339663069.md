   "message": "The way I am seeing it is that the Account ONLY exists because of my signature.  I really don't want some moron on the side of the road with a gun causing ME harm because this Person doesn't have a Drivers License, so I will keep it.  I see it that I could accept the Security Instrument he charges the Person with on the side of the road and as Creditor (later at my office) I could FORGIVE the charges. It seems like it is even easier than Buck o Five or Pete's method.",
