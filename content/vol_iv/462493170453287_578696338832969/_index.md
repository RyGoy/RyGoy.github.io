   "message": "I have a question for Scott Duncan:\n\n1) You had mentioned in a previous post that sending an \"Affidavit of Affirmation\" to the Register of Demographics Office (that's the name of the agency that issues surety bonds here) claiming the PERSON, would be sufficient to cover \"MY\" obligation. Would this process be sufficient to place a LIEN on the PERSON? \n\nAnd if so, who makes the CLAIM, \"ME\" with my TAKEN NAME as a MAN, and/or a proxy?\n\nThanks for any time to respond, Admiral.",
