Focus on reality.\n\nBitcoin becomes FIAT, move to LiteCoin or RoboCoin, or DogeCoin.\n\nMake a Forex-like exchange for cryptographic currencies.\n\nYou didn't watch Dan Kaminsky's video I see... even though I've posted it a HUNDRED times.\n\nYes. in the end, the mysterious INVENTOR of bitcoin... GETS ALL THE MONEY. It's not a surprise.\n\nMake your OWN currency, GET ALL THE MONEY in the end...\n\nI've covered all of this. Nobody can connect the dots, or can be bothered to ACTUALLY study. It's why I'm cutting all of  you loose. I was WELL on my ways, but somebody tried re-writing history and pretending Daniel J Wentz was speaking out of turn or was somehow derelict in his duties.\n\nI shall resume my exodus soon. We'e got Parties to ventilate. ;)",
