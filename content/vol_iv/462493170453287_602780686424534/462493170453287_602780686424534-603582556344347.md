I do not recognize the name and looked at Money as Debt (which I have watched a few times) and at the video pinned in The Answer to  Everything (which I did also watch). What did I miss Scott Duncan? Please post this video for the 101st time. I do understand that creating my own currency is the goal. I am not sure I have connected the dots on HOW. I am SLOW at this whole commerce and HAVE been studying to the point of confusing myself. Any one else who knows the video that Scott is speaking of please share.",
