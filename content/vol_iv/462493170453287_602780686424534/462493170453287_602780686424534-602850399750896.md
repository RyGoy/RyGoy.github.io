   "message": "\"Bitcoin, however, could become a global currency (NWO style), something the bankers attempted with the dollar. Theoretically, the Bitcoin could become the International Reserve Currency and over time other currencies could be eliminated, leaving only Bitcoin as the world�s primary currency. If Bitcoin became the primary world currency all advantages will disappear. Bitcoin wallets would likely become standardized and government issued (with backdoors reducing privacy.) As a global currency, Bitcoin might have to be registered to be spent and the distributive and private Bitcoin blockchain network could become �globalized� (as opposed to nationalized) and become the property of a world government.\n\nRegardless, over time, tighter control of Internet use, and improving technology to monitor Net transactions and the possible introduction of a World Government issued Bitcoin Wallet, it would be very easy to track all transactions and know immediately the currency holdings of all holders of Bitcoin. \n\nLong term, I expect the privacy benefits of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies will be consumed by evolving technology, �Skynet� type technology, designed to totally monitor all digital activity of the human being.\"      Scott Duncan, this part I found interesting. Why/how would this possible? Would not the ones who created bitcoin, therefore having ultimate authority of it, have to implement all the \"control\" factors themselves?",
