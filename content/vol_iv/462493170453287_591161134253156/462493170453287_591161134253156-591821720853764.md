   "message": "Hmmmmm. Interesting proposal Pete Daoust. I am starting to think that giving value to any one else's currency doesn't really benefit me in the end. I understand how digital currency can be non-centralized but what I don't understand is how it all of the sudden becomes \"worth\" such and such amount of USD. What stops the creators of these currencies from simply \"selling\" it all? I know I simply don't understand enough about these currencies but I can't help but be sceptical. Until I understand more I will keep watching.",
