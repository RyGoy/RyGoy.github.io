   "message": "Hi Beverly,\n\nThanks for sharing this interesting perspective on our government, our Country and our money. I agree that it is contrived that we are basically taken stock of our existence (birth certification) and then taxed until the day we die (our liability to our country and its debt). But believe me this has been going on for centuries and there are always going to be a few that will benefit more than others.\nSuch is life! Why should we try to change the wheel when it has been developed to a perfect way for those who have more to gain? The only thing I do feel we must strive for is what we are promised via our government (the reason we pay taxes in the first place) and that is everyone is free to live in our country and receive an education, have our health, and to EARN a living for the sake of paying any debts we incur in our own households. The paper we hold that says we have a property in our name, is our opportunity to have something of value to our name.  Many places in the world this is unattainable - are we not lucky? And the value of our property can go up - so that we may gain more for our family - future generations?! Is This the purpose of our space in this country?1?\nGive the government its money - it has it \"face\" value on it - Just to quote from the Bible (even though I know you may not agree, functionally it exudes every moral, conflict, and much more about every aspect of \"life\" whether you believe in GOD, Jesus or a higher power.)\n\n7 For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. 8 But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. 9 People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.\n\nRomans 13:6-8\n6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God�s servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.\nRomans 13: 5,6\n\n5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.\n\n6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God�s servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.\n\nDoes this make any sense? Rules are meant to be followed? Yes? - It creates harmony and respect each other. PLease work on paying your utility billings - I would not want them to put a lien on your property that you live in and have paid into for so long.  \n\n-Also everyone is out there earning a living, paying taxes, paying bills - are you thinking our govt will pay our way? just because we are its property? It is merely a way of tracking our existence and making sure we \"pay our own way for the privilege of living here.\" The bigger question is - Would we get that opportunity else where in this world? On another note though - I always admired your strength of always giving 100% of yourself when it came to learning something or figuring out how to do something - Always training yourself how to do things that are crazy difficult for most but you dive in and research or keep pushing yourself to find out how to make it work (web designing, renovating and earning your interior design certification, just to name a few) With that in mind - I think your disappointment  in our govt run country should be taken with a different approach - Politics!! LOL better to understand from this inside!!",
