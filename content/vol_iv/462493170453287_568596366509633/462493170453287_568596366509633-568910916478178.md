   "message": "Quote:  Dean: Judge of violations: Me, I'm the author.\n\n\"Further clarification for the ninnies. Only I knew my intent when I drafted the legislation, and since I'm the author only I can determine its meaning. For those people out there that think anyone gives a flying fuck about your interpretation of the copyrighted Acts and Statutes of Canada.\"\n\nSo, I bet those judges who are qualified to interpret the intent of Acts and Statutes are really interested in what you have to say. So, now what are you going to do in one of those hearings?",
