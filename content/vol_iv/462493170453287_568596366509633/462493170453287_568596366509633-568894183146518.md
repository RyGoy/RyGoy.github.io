   "message": "The Plumber's Society summoned a plumber associated to their organization to assess a fine for violations of their \"Plumbing Association\" rules and regulations. You are certified and recognized in their system when doing plumbing work under that registered name. That's the rules/jurisdiction the court operates under, and they have a mandate to operate, absent being able to demonstrate to the contrary, that the claims of the Plaintiff are accurate, and made in good faith. \n\nIf Scott agrees with that, then there are several suggestions for how to proceed to remove the \"presumptions\" they are required by law to operate under.  :)",
