Always check with the author, as his intent is the absolute authority. \n\nHow many pearls did I cast today Scott? There better be some non swine out there today, or I just made a VERY bad investment, and that makes me very moody. \n\nP.S. I'll be out there from the 14th to the 23rd ish. Supper with Tara? We have some waitresses to harass and cause to blush.....",
