   "message": "Statutory Court is limited to statutory authority, statutes do not recognize non statutory sources of authority, and most certainly do not respect human rights. It's contract law, why are people trying to reserve human freedoms in a court of contract where they have signed agreements to perform under a certain authority?  :P Non statutory right are irrelevant in a statutory jurisdiction. Of course they're all reserved. That's not what is going on there. You are well aware of the fact that there are more relevant things that can be brought up in statutory court, Scott.   :P",
