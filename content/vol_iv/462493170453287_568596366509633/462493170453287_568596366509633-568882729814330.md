   "message": "1859 - USA is Bankrupt - Bankers give a few years to arrange payment - Civil War is an excuse to pledge more land by gaining the southern states into the UNION - International Law provides 70 years for countries to pay debt - 1929 - Debt is due again! -  US pledges citizens as collateral to pay debt - this is resolved by 1933 - 1997 - Debt is due again! This time there is nothing else to pledge. A few years later US invades Iraq. <---This from Winston Shrout.",
