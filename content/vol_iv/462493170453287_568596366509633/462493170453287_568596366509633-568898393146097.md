   "message": "So, while I'm still using poor judgement and investing my time here, who can field where a good place to start might be, for those foolish enough to show up for the hearing instead of declining the offer. \n\n *Hint*  Plumbers do not have the right to create new rules and regulations and plumb any way they want when representing the \"Plumber's Society\" and operating under a name registered with them for those purposes. So reserving the \"Right\" to plumb any way you want......is not something you can reserve in that jurisdiction. \n\nThere is an \"unless\" I can add to that, but if anyone can figure that one out, you won't need a translator anymore. :P",
