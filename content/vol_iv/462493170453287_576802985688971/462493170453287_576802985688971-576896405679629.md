   "message": "If you look at Ceit's post, she's saying that acting inappropriately and then coming back under another name and doing the same thing is counterproductive and does not benefit you, or anyone else, in any way. You learn nothing and you waste your time and that of others.\n\nYou'll notice Ceit didn't personally attack \"him\", his appearance, his family...there was actually useful advice in this post for anyone with rudimentary reading and comprehension abilities.  You may not like the delivery, but you should note the message.\n\nFree speech is more important to me than you can imagine.  That said, I don't condone personal attacks.  Here, or anywhere.\n\nI have made a concerted attempt never to delete anyone's comments.  I always assume censoring the thoughts and feelings of other people denies them a fundamental right and any opportunity someone else may gain from a different viewpoint - positive or negative.\n\nBut I don't know how many more times I can say the same thing again, and again, and again.  Whatever you may imagine the people in this forum are not your personal friends; and you really don't know enough about ANY of them to attack them personally.\n\nPlease stop this now before I change my life philosophy and start randomly deleting your valuable comments.",
