   "message": "\"Bob Week\" aka: Jay Hank/Jeff Roggers/Who-Are-You Frisbey has, once more, LEFT the fucking building. \n\nI didn't feel it necessary to actually state this, since one would assume that common sense would dictate such a thing, but here we are so obviously it must be said:\n\nIf you find yourself banned from the group, the appropriate fucking reaction is NOT to start spawning dummy accounts and jump back in. Perhaps some time spent reflecting on the events which led to your unceremonious exit would serve you better. (The Ministry of Serenity is currently unoccupied and available for self-improvement sessions!)\n\nIn the long run, what did this really accomplish? Sure, \"Jeff\"...uhh, I mean \"Bob\", got a few more days of reading in. In the end, the same shit outed him. \n\nIf you have been booted for a reason that is potentially correctable, try that route. If that fails, take comfort in the knowledge that you have NO ONE to blame but yourself.",
