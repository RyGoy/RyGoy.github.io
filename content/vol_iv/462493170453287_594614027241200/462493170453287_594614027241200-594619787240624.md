   "message": "Scott told me over the phone that Law Dictionaries were basically a 'SECOND-FENCE,' too for us.....they were created by the same guys who created SHAKESPEARE and THE BIBLE. So if i ever have to go to court, im going to put in my Affidavit that i am using the words that my public servants taught me in grade-school/high-school/University/and kindergarten, from the Webster's Dictionary my daddy bought me for Christmas when i was 12\n\n..then again- it IS fun learning THEIR words, and using'em against THEM :D\n\nSigned,\nSurreptitiously and Latently Covinous",
