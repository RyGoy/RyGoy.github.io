   "message": "If you must drive w/a license (because you have not killed your person yet), dont carry it, give first and last name then ask (although you are not obligated to give a name, it makes it less confrontational, give the taken name only), what are my rights in this situation, if they say anything other than you have the right to remain silent then they are trying to perpetrate fraud. Never carry any ID or give an address and date of birth. if they arrest you for using your rights (remaining silent and not creating joinder), send an invoice with an affidavit to the offenders and the assurance company. Common law jurisdiction does not require one to carry identification of any sort. think about why you have the right to remain silent and how that works with the common law right to not carry ID, remember, the only right you have is the right not to be forced into contract. If they point to the in-car computer and ask, is this YOU, you can laugh and tell them no, I am right here, hahaha",
