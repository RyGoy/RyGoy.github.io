   "message": "Until you resign from government service, as long as you have a license (sending it back doesn't count), they have every right to presume that you are still an employee. The birth certificate has no contractual ties to you. You didn't ask for it, you didn't sign it, and there's no address. The license is what hooks you. Your address is now registered as belonging to the name (crown corporation). Your photo and your signature are attached to it, affirming that YES, that NAME is you.",
