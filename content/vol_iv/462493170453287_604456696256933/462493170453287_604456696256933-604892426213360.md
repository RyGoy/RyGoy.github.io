   "message": "NOTICE of Confusion and Intent to Lien\n 12/26/13\nTo: Kathryn Morris Early, Clerk of Court\nCC: Honorable Paul C. Dawley, Chief Justice of the District Court\n\nFrom: SGMI\n\nRegistered Mail #\n\nDocket # 1340CR000301\n\nKathryn, \n\nTake NOTICE�.On December 26, 2013, SGMI, the lawful Administrator of CHRISTOPHER EVAN SCHULTE, received a piece of mail from an unidentified party.  Although we are not sure, we think it came in an envelope from your Court.  A copy is enclosed for your review.  We cannot read what appears to be cursive writing and believe no such law exists requiring us to.  Please let the appropriate parties, if applicable, know of the confusion.\n\nWe do not recognize the document as following any known procedure or format.  If the court wishes to address CHRISTOPHER EVAN SCHULTE, for now and in the future, we ONLY recognize type written Notices, in 12 to 14 point font, in Times New Roman or Arial font, on Court letterhead, signed by whomever is wishing to contact us under their proper oath and attestation and in what capacity and/or Title whomever is operating within.\n\nIf we do not receive a response from your Court in a manner which we can read and comprehend as defined in this Notice, it will be understood by ALL parties that the communication is non-conforming to the format outlined in this Notice and is of no force or effect.\n\nIf your Court did, in fact, send us this Document and your Court is, in fact, trying to communicate important information in this Document that we were sent, take Notice that the communication has not been comprehended and NO UNDERSTANDING has taken place.  If we don�t receive a replacement Document with the proper communication within five (5) days, we will presume that no communication was intended and there was a mistake.\n\nAlso, as per proper Public Notice issued on November 22, 2013 published in the Salem News and on Facebook at CHRISTOPHER EVAN SCHULTE, please see the attached Invoice and remit payment promptly.  We do not wish to extend your corporation Credit and intend on securing a lien against your corporation if the Invoice is not satisfied within 5 days (January 2, 2014).\n\nFrom the President�s desk of SGMI\nLawful Administrator of CHRISTOPHER EVAN SCHULTE",
