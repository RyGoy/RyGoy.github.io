   "message": "Have you thought about entering the Certificate of Live Birth into the court record? After all, that's the 'person' they're after. And since you're the only one short of a court order that can obtain a certified copy of that document, have you given your written-authorized consent to hold a shareholders meeting for CHRIS EVAN?\n\nThat's your proof that you are the sole beneficiary of the estate, and the judge is to be appointed the trustee by you, if not, he's going to switch hats and give you the trustee hat and put on the administrators hat and administrate the hell out of that estate for you ;)",
