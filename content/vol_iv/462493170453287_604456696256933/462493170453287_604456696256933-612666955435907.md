   "message": "So I called the stupid Kourt to see about some stupid appointment that if I don't make on Friday, they will send their ARMY after me for.  And......they said its a Discovery Hearing.  Now, either I am completely losing it, or they have fucked around with procedure because the last time I left that stupid Kourt, they said \"Jury Trial\".  There is no way I mistook the 2...no way!!!  It must have something to do with me adamantly stating on the record that \"Until my questions are answered I don't understand the nature and cause of the charges against me\"",
