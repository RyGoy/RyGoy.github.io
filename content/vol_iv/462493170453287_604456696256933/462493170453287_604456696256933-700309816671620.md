   "message": "\"...the directions stated no post office box for address allowed\" This is true but I was told when I formed my ON corp this is so that someone is there to accept documents being served. I intend on updating the address to a UPS Store NOT a PO BOX since my current address for the UPS Store is #123 - 4567 Any Street, Toronto, ON\n\nCapitain Pete, I would suggest obtaining a different address for service for the corporation. SEPARATION is important and key to asset protection in general. I was also planning to use the UPS Store address for my PERSON so that it is clear that this is not me on the Driver's Licence. Recent comments on this thread are fucking this plan up in my head though.",
