   "message": "Beverly Berta Braakschmack: The stupid thing is that nobody wanted to take responsibility so the \"leaders\" were chosen on our stupid behalf... and we just shrugged.\n\nFrom an administrative viewpoint, how does one change this?\n\nIn addition to liening the name into a private trust, is there a need to revoke the power of attorney granted when we registered (on the person's behalf) to vote ie: to be represented by some other party?\n\nIs the affidavit to the registrar general (spoken about in another thread) the necessary action which revokes the power of attorney and/or removes the person as a citizen from the government books?\n\nI'm trying to make certain I have everything sorted so that any and all adhesion contracts between the person and the state have been adequately severed so there can be no presumed liability remaining.\n\nIf law (if/when they obey the rules) is about intent more than form, does this suffice in severing the obligations and/or satisfy the intent?",
