   "message": "Well, tell me why do you think you can go in there and do anything? I mean, your a fucking user, simple, its not ur property to do anything with. If you actually read the notice of mistake and read it aloud into the court and you get no answers, what the fuck is stopping you from stating,  \nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE for the LEGAL NAME. WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE and have ANY SURETY with respect to the LEGAL NAME? --SILENCE, no response, ON and for the RECORD, LET THE RECORD SHOW, all parties are in agreement that i am not a trustee nor surety for the legal name, NOW HOW HARD IS THAT ?????????? so what they wont fucking answer, answer it for them geeez, who is running this damn court anyways ????  This same routine goes for all questions they wont respond to, watch how fast they will respond when you say something like this...i did it, got a quick reaction and denial. What is the legal maxim for denying something ??????? Quick ..quick...",
