   "message": "Okay thanks Capitaine Pete. I get what you're saying...so once you have received a NOTICE (Parking Infraction Notice or Offence Notice) then you should DISCHARGE using the PERSON's SURETY. \n\nI tried this approach without success (possibly because of fucking FREE-DUMB programming). I conditionally accepted (per the BILLS of Exchange ACT) the notice and asked for the BILL and a copy of the two party contract giving rise to the bill. The City of Mississauga refused saying they don't provide this for parking related matters. \n\nWhat I should have done FIRST after conditionally accepting was ask CAN I USE THE PERSON'S SURETY TO DISCHARGE THIS PUBLIC DEBT? I can still do this now though since the PUBLIC DEBT has not been PAID or DISCHARGED :D\n\nThanks for cleaning this up in my brain!",
