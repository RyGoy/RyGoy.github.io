   "message": "\"unless the JOINDER was a MISTAKE\" This was my thought precisely Rodrigo Dan Darius and where I had thought the NOTICE OF MISTAKE came in to play. But that was thinking WRONG :( \n\nI have never understood how their can be \"agreement between the parties\" when FULL DISCLOSURE was never provided. I may have applied for the Driver's Licence but did so before I was sixteen. What is the age that one is considered LEGALLY COMPETENT. Either the government gave FULL DISCLOSURE and I'm an IDIOT (meaning unable to contract), which some days it feels that way, or they did not! At the very least it is obvious that JOINDER is being created without having any knowledge or UNDERSTANDING of this so how can anyone consent where FULL DISCLOSURE is not given? My brain hurts trying to make sense of this.\n\nOf course this is CONTRACT LAW so I'm thinking I may be confusing this and TRUST LAW. I think ChiefRock Sino General is the man to talk to about CONTRACT LAW. Any insights Chief?",
