   "message": "Pete Daoust: \"The AGENCY is surety Ceit, not the agent, the agent must ACCEPT the traffic ticket, and the AGENCY must settle the debt, the agency is PIERRE DAOUST, and PIERRE DAOUST's surety can discharge the debt....me, I am NOT the agency when I am DRIVING A CAR, I am the agent\"\n\nI think you meant \"the AGENT is PIERRE DAOUST\". And technically a MAN is driving the car, the PERSON is the AGENT which is used to create JOINDER (the bridge) to the man driving. The man is unwittingly hooped into ACCEPTING SURETY for the PERSON when he is forced to hand over the PERSON's driver's licence.",
