   "message": "Avoid trouble by making sure the PERSON's driver's license is in the PERSON's car... It's THE GOVT's PERSON. It MUST provide the driver's license ID when asked to... Just make sure they ask for THE PERSON's driver's license...\n\nMake it clear that if they wanna see a driver's license, they MUST ask for the PERSON's driver's license... Next time I think I'm gonna ask them to request the license by handing over a written/signed demand (to the Sole Authorized Administrator) for the PERSON's license... Hell why not even prepare the entire paperwork with carbon copies and they just have to sign..?\n\nMake it clear it's not you. You are a man, you have the person / the slave / their slave. They WILL issue a ticket to the PERSON / slave / agent... So what... Being a MAN doesn't mean you can run around doing whatever you feel like without anyone noticing...\n\nTHEN you take that ticket and administrate it as Pete says...\n\n***EDIT : BEGIN SHITSTAIN***\nRegarding who's agent / agency : I too think the PERSON is the AGENT for the GOVERNMENT and/or whichever govt agency is in charge of PERSONs driving on the roads... As a MAN, I'm not an AGENT for a GOVERNMENT AGENCY, even if the AGENCY is the PERSON... That would make me an AGENT of a SLAVE AGENCY ???\n***END***",
