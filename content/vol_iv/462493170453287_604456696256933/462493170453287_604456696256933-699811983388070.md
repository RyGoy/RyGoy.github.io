   "message": "I'm really confused now. Here's the thing though...only a PERSON can be an AGENT. Is it not true that JOINDER is required to ACT upon that MAN through his PERSON? Only a MAN can operate/drive a car...this is reality. Of course LEGALLY the GOVERNMENT or the COURTS will say that the PERSON/AGENT was driving to gain JURISDICTION but this is IMPOSSIBLE since the PERSON only exists on paper. Man provides energy/value to EVERY THING in commerce. That is why JOINDER and SURETY are essential in this thing. Or am i wrong? :/",
