   "message": "I am not understanding what is going on with these court cases I have.  NO ONE will answer a single question I have asked specifically regarding the questions on the Notice of Mistake.  Yet, if I don't show up to these tribunals, they send out there bouncers to arrest ME.  \n\nAgain, I received a letter from the court today which says \"the Defendant falls within the definition of Person\".  And the definition of Person in the Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 4 Section 7 is \"association, partnership, corporation, or society\".  \n\nPerhaps the \"Defendant\" falls within this definition, but not the Justice, DA, or Cops have said how that could be ME.  \n\nI am confused as to what the next step is.  They CLEARLY have no intent on finding the Surety in the matter, they ONLY want to \"proceed\" against ME.  Do I issue another Notice of Mistake? (I have good reasons to believe that they don't care about these questions at this point)  Do I find the Surety and send a bill for doing it? (of course, properly notify them first)  Or what else...?\n\nIt seems EVERYONE else using the Notice of Mistake is having very favorable results, but not me.  They keep fucking with me.  \n\nWhat are some thoughts that others have?",
