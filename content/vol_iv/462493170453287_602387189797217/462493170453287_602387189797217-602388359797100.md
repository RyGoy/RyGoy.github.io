Replace \"***redacted shit here***\" with the PARTY/SUBJECT/VESSEL.\n\nScott Duncan Derek Moran - NOTICES NOTIFY! That's what makes it a NOTICE. It's not for ASKING. The purpose is NOT to have a chat, or ask questions.\n\nIt's a NOTICE.\n\nScott Duncan Nope. Did you recently read a \"No Parking\" sign and the sign \"followed up\" with you?\n\nScott Duncan Why would you need anything else?\n\nBeverly Berta Braakschmack In court, if you stated that you did not receive proper notice, you are indicating full disclosure, correct?\n\nScott Duncan PROPER NOTICE IS disclosure. Before the sign \"keep off the grass\" was put there, no INTENT was disclosed.\n\nScott Duncan The law is about INTENT",
