   "message": "oh yah, if you can not back up what you claim, they will say you have no evidence to support such a claim. maybe this sepperates [fact finding] 'evidence' from 'proof'.\n\nlike if i claimed to have built the motorcycle, but can not tell a juror how i did it, the motorcycle might only be proof that it does infact exist and can not 'evidence' my claim that i knew how to do it proving by fact that my claim of 'it is mine i built it, he who makes a thing owns a thing'...\n\n'sufficient of facts finding' that an average joe could easily and commonly understand to determin the claim is truth in full and not deception/fraud.\n\nyes, a pot induced post. :)",
