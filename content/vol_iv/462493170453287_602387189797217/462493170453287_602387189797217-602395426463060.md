   "message": "Mackximus Minimus Joseph Davia, if it was me signing a legal document, I try to avoid it at all times, unless is completely to \"MY\" benefit. If signing a contract, I use<<Authorized BY: (seal/signature here) \"All Rights Reserved\" \"Non-Assumpsit.\">>\n\nIf I should be forced to sign anything (by inmates, and gardas punching my legs, in some crazy initiation, perhaps? lol), or forced to sign a traffic ticket (and/or ANY contracts in which I don't want to act as surety) I JUST SIGN VOID.\n\nIn what respects to the \"cv\" you mentioned, perhaps you are referring to V.C., short for Vi Coactus.\n<<Vi coactus is a Latin term, abbreviated as V.C., and means: 'under constraint'. It is used to indicate an agreement made under duress.\nAn example of its usage is that of the Dutch 17th century statesman Cornelius de Witt, who was forced to sign the act for restoration of Stadholderate. After all the entreaties by his wife, though he signed the contract but only before adding V.C. to his signature. [1] In the early chapters of his historically-set novel The Black Tulip, Alexandre Dumas describes the episode in detail, along with the role and meaning of the two letters V.C.>>\n\nIf one DOES NOT know WHY is using all these when signing, it's completely useless then. Hope this helps!\n\nScott Duncan Maximiliano Pï¿½rez, you have to be one of thr most attentive readers here.\n\nOf all the people on here, you are the one I NEVER have to worry about missing my points.\n\nYou covered that well.",
