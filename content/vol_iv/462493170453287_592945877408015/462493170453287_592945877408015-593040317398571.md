Too many people who think \"that's ok\".\n\nI am going to vanish and commit some crimes.\n\nIf I'm going to be treated like a violent criminal, even though I'm not a Freeloader on the land who thinks it's ok to ignore contracts;\n\nI PAY MY BILLS\nI PAID OFF MY MORTGAGE\nI PAID ALL MY TAXES\n\nI PAID IN TIME AS WELL.\n\nAfter all that, if the government thinks it's ok to treat me like a violent criminal, then I intend to BE a violent criminal.\n\nThose prisons they've build will be for the \"Worst Offenders\", because the best ones don't get caught.",
