   "message": "i had a feeling this was what i was going to come back to. so you guys are still thinking 'feel good' (most). ok, that dean thread scott ended up talking to a whole bunch of people who are part of deans group list, and some started getting real hard on scott, calling him some fucking nasty shitt and refferences. half those talking were tTfL, the rest were pure dean is god. and well you know, sinse scott is ALLWAYS right, and our belief in 'feel good' is more important than PROVEABLE scott popped a circuit breaker.\n\nwhy scott hates everyone is because nomatter how small any one might have any minor belief, the most miniscule support of the system has its consequences. (not killing/eliminating your rapist IS support for that cause).",
