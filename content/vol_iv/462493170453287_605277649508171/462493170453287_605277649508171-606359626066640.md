   "message": "The structure and plausible deniability built into the control construct is fascinating.\nLike the word Money� \nMon = prefix for mono meaning singular� ey =eye. Money = One eye top of pyramid.\nJust like in the prisoner� No number one�\nSo in all the info about these so called illuminati and the all seeing eye are false.\nIt is about limiting our vision down to half and then lying about it� creating a myth.\nthe pyramid structure actually does not have a leader it is represented by money� the second level and highest level that can be reached; is occupied by the accountants.\nWe can only see out of one eye and value something that is intrinsically worthless.\nIt limits us to not seeing the forest for the trees. \nThe people who are learning are the illuminated ones� \nThose others who think it is their right to rule are programmed that way as well.\nThere is No ONE at the top; we create it by our continued worship of the almighty dollar.\nI do not value that anymore.",
