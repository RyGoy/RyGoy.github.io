   "message": "But thanks for letting me know you have ignored EVERYTHING said here, and pretending to have an informed opinion when you are simply talking like an infiltrator.\n\nFuck you, and your stupidity.\n\nAs for the New York Times Douche...\n\nYOU ARE DAMN RIGHT IT'S A WEAPON AGAINST CENTRAL BANKS! I thought I mentioned that months ago...\n\n...did I not mention I was going to collapse the banking system and start a war? \n\nI SWEAR I DID!\n\nMaybe I just dreamed it. Bitcoin is just the FIRST shot. As other currencies rise people will see that they can create THEIR OWN currencies, and they will need a way to securely transact with other people's currencies without an exchange that can be taken down on a government whim.\n\nWho on EARTH will be able to SOLVE THIS?!?! WE'RE DOOOOOOMED!\n\n...oh wait, I have that built and ready. Never mind :D",
