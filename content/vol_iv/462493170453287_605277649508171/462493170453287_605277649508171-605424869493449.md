   "message": "\"How do those bitcoins work if the power goes out?\"\n\nThis stupidity is what gets people banned. As long as 2 people on the FUCKING PLANET have a blockchain, IT FUCKING WORKS FINE!\n\nThis is disinformation BASED ON IGNORANCE! You think all the coins disappear?\n\nCan you do online banking when the power's out? No?\n\nIn fact banks tend to CLOSE when the FUCKING POWER IS OUT.\n\nOr MAYBE you think CA$H is going to save you. Well if the power is out, I can pay you with a FUCKING QR CODE on a FUCKING PIECE OF PAPER.\n\nThese idiotic questions are DISINFORMATION and not legitimate inquiry, so I give the answer to everyone ELSE except the guy who asked. You value ignorance and lies? LET ME INDULGE YOU BY BANNING YOUR ASS, and cleaning up the shitstain you leave. Let everyone ELSE benefit and let the shit from the stain you left, stick to you.",
