   "message": "In my opinion, the confusion lies in suggesting one can only interact in the world of commerce with only one form of currency...why limit yourself?\n\nkeep some gold & silver, store some food, medicine, condoms, cigarettes etc (from a survival barter point of view), petrol, matches, vodka (medicinal & currency) etc etc \n\nkeep crypto currencies that are portable & usable at the other end if you need to get out of dodge quickly,\n\nand also hold some fiat for convenience (but only for cash transactions...and emergencies).",
