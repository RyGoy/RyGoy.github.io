   "message": "There is no side...\nJust reality.  In reality it does not add up.\nA man who professes to know law is hauled away in front of witness's... Goes quietly.... the people around him, as he is being hauled away, are asking questions. The impotence of their responses, and the: just doing their job thing, bothers me.\nThe bottom line is we do not know what happened.\nI was not there and the video from my viewing, it is even hard to see Dean amongst all the people... discombobulated.\nIt is suspicious to say the least.  \nWhy?  One would have to know motives of others and I am not privy to that info.  It is not a trust worthy situation.\nI do not trust what has been staged it seems ...\nIf I am wrong, I will admit it. I do not want to be right... but reality doesn't give two shits about me. \nIn my reality only me cares about me.",
