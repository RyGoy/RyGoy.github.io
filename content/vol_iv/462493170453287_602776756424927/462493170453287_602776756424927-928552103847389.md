   "message": "To the casual reader:\n\nThe NX2000 network is running a test. They are \"Salting\" ciphers with random coordinate data collected from player movements. It has been a HUGE success.\n\nThe game we use is the 10 Year old BATTLEFIELD 2142, with our modification. There is a python API, allowing my students to enhance the A.I. \n\nThe game is not playable without the online account system, but we have a profound love for this game. In 2014 Gamespy (The online part) shut down, and we are working on reconstructing it. It's about 85% done.\n\nCurrently I am teaching Tara, and Ceit PHP, MySQL, and the bootstrap CSS framework. That is the \"Master Server\" front end, which you won't find at http://2142.roguesupport.com because if you did, you'd see their half-finished broken site, so they asked me not to point you there.\n\n...so you won't find it there.",
