   "message": "I also learned how to become a bank and I'm pleased to announce I have my own alt-currency as of today. :)\n\nI will now accept Pillowcoin in exchange for services rendered which will not give me \"legal tender taxable profit\". \n\nIf you want to mine it let me know. I have set up a pool. I still have to set up my websites pillowcoin.org and pillowcoin.com and link them to me. Coming soon!\n\nNow on to Etherium apps, Thanks again to all that have helped! I couldn't have done this without you.",
