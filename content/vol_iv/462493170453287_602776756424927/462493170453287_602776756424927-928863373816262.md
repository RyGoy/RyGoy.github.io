   "message": "\"None of my LEGAL documents ever discussed the case. My focus was always on SURETY. Who has it, and what EVIDENCE does the COURT have that it is me. \"\n\nTo clarify then... when Ceit filed the affirmation/affidavit it ONLY asked these two questions and included a NOTICE of MISTAKE and/or possibly NOTICE OF WAIVER OF PUBLIC BENEFITS as EXHIBITS...but nothing more. Nothing about what happened, what you were doing, the weather outside...nothing!  Is this correct?",
