   "message": "OK��here is what I have learned in here, so far�..I think it�s AMAZING, but that is just �ME�, ALL of this, from a STRANGER on the internet :D\n\n1). I am a MAN, and I have a PERSON.\n\n2). Bank Notes are TENDERS for some Legal stuff.\n\n3). Bank Notes are meant to be used by PERSONS.\n\n4). I am the SOLE authorized Administrator for the person named PIERRE DAOUST.\n\n5). If that person uses BANK NOTES, it has to declare having using it.\n\n6). That person will get taxed having using these bank notes.\n\n7). These taxes will be sent to the person in form of PUBLIC DEBTS.\n\n8). I have the right to buy back these debts, and pay for them\n\n9). I have the right to administrate these debts and get them discharged via the person�s surety.\n\n10). I have administrated 11 of these debts so far, ALL PUBLIC DEBTS.\n\n11). I have administrated PUBLIC utility bills, Federal income tax bill, Quebec income tax bills, scholar tax bills, traffic tickets bills, Ambulance Bill, School bills.\n\n12). I also received an offer to take a new picture of my face, to put it on 2 pieces of identifications.\n\n13). Problem is, these IDs, identifies the person, and not me.\n\n14). I have NOTIFIED them, to make sure they understand the I have no problem putting MY face on these, but it is strictly to identify the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR of that said person.\n\n15). I also asked them to tell me which birth date they need, MINE, or the persons birth date, I know them two :D, and can prove them two :D\n\n16). I have learned that I AM a supreme being, and that I can write the law.\n\n17). I also learned that I have lots of determination.\n\n18). I also learned that I can be lazy as hell :D\n\n19). I also learned that I am a BELLIGERENT \n\n20). I also learned that this game is all about surety and who accounts for it.\n\n21). I also learned that I have to act with Respect, Honor, Dignity and Integrity with �ME\n\n22). I also learned that I am a LEADER, and I have the ability to find other LEADERS.\n\n23). My goal now, is to spread the truth, and find other leaders to do the same.\n\n24). Thank you Scott Duncan ;)\n\n25). I am sure I forget something :D\n\nP.S. I also learned that some stupid thugs will try to fuck around with the surety of the person I happen to have in my pocket, that�s seems to be inevitable� :D\n\nMuhahahahaha!!!! :D\n\nFFFFFREEEEEEDDDDUMMMMMMBBBBBBBBB !!!! :D :D",
