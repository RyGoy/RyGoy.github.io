   "message": "Ceit Butler's case is covered here.\n\nShe DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING about the facts of the case. She was not whining about \"private property\" or \"notices\". She didn't mention it, as she didn't want the facts (beat the crap out of some dude in the middle of the street) to be an issue.\n\nWant to argue the facts? Go in Pro Se, or get a lawyer.",
