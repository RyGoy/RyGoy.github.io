   "message": "So, on to the educating stuff! Let's compare my case to this one. At NO point, EVER, did I discuss the details of the case. I was asked TWO questions during my arrest. One was a clumsy attempt to trick me into admitting guilt and the other was, amusingly enough, \"are you one of them Freemen?\" \n\nNone of my LEGAL documents ever discussed the case. My focus was always on SURETY. Who has it, and what EVIDENCE does the COURT have that it is me. \n\nThat's it. Those are your only questions. \n\n\"What EVIDENCE does this COURT have that I have any SURETY in this matter\"\n\nAnd;\n\n\"By what AUTHORITY do you ATTACH any NAME derived from a PUBLIC DOCUMENT to me\"\n\nThese are the questions that you REQUIRE an answer to in order to UNDERSTAND the NATURE and CAUSE of these PROCEEDINGS.",
