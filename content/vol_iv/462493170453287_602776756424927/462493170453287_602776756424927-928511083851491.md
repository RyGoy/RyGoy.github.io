   "message": "Shit! I did not want to mention this here, but recently started helping in this initiative, https://www.facebook.com/PuertoRicoBitcoin\n\nSomething else I am doing is that I exchange my farm products, or time as musician, only for bitcoins or Dogecoins. I tell them that if they exchange Bitcoins for my produce, then I give them a 50% discount compared to USD. I have tons of food to cover that. So a many merchants have wallets here now. Some competitors a complaining, but there nothing they can do.\n\nThe other thing is that just started to publish ALL notices unanswered by local \"trusted officials\" in the legal section of the newspaper here. That's is going to be interesting.\n\nSo, there some things I am doing, but I have been reluctant to let them take me seriously while I am learning! :P",
