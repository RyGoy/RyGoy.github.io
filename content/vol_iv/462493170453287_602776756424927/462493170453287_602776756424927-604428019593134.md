   "message": "On the topic of parasites being able to look themselves in the mirror...here's an extract from a letter I used to respond to a third party interloper... \n\n(I refer to him as Johno because he kept writing to me, assuming we had some sort of relationship, so he must have thought we were mates):\n\n'I�m an honourable man and have already asked you to produce evidence of a valid relationship and valid claim.  You have failed.  Until you can produce evidence Johno, go and do something productive, like volunteering at a soup kitchen for the homeless.\n\nIt�s funny how you tell me about interest accruing on the account in question Johno, especially at this time of year, Christmas.  Are you a Christian Johno, or a Jew, Buddhist, Hindu or do you follow one of the Islamic faiths?\n\nThe reason I ask Johno, is because usury is one of the most reprehensible non-criminal practices someone can do to his fellow man.  \n\nHere�s what Wikipedia has to say on the subject:\n�� According to some dictionaries, simply charging any interest at all can be considered usury��\n\n��Some of the earliest known condemnations of usury come from the Vedic texts of India.  Similar condemnations are found in religious texts from Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  At times, many nations from ancient China to ancient Greece to ancient Rome have outlawed loans with any interest. Though the Roman Empire eventually allowed loans with carefully restricted interest rates, the Christian church in medieval Europe banned the charging of interest at any rate.��\n\nWhy do you think usury is such a disgusting, immoral act Johno?\n\nThink of it this way:  If there is only $100.00 in existence, and I loan it all to you, at the very reasonable rate of 1% interest, no matter what you do, you can never pay me back in full because there is more debt than there is money to pay it, so the interest compounds to ridiculous levels.\n\nSo consequently Johno, I can then come and claim your home, throw you, your missus and kids out on the street and make you all destitute, for 1% on money that doesn�t even exist!  What a crappy thing to do to my fellow man, even when he gave me all that he owed me, my greed would result in him being homeless.  What an absolutely scummy cruel and horrible thing to do!\n\nWith usury, any interest rate, no matter how small, ultimately results in there being more debt than there is money to repay it.  Ultimately, someone (or many someones) end up losing their homes, turn to drugs and alcohol, prostitution, marriages end, families are destroyed, people end up on the street�all because some scumbag (or group of scumbags) value bits of paper and plastic with pictures on them (and made up numbers on a computer screen, more than they care about their fellow man.\n\nSo Merry Christmas Johno, think of the homeless when you tuck into that big turkey, or seafood platter or whatever you munch down on for Christmas dinner.  \n\nSpare a thought for the girl selling her body on the street because her old man suicided after losing the family home as your kids rip open their toys and other useless crap that will be piled up in the back of the garage never to be used again.  And try to look your wife in the eye as you tell her that you really do something that creates a brighter future for all Australians, instead of serving the corporate greed of banks that create money out of thin air.  \n\nWell done Johno, keep looking at yourself in the mirror and convincing yourself that you�re a good bloke as you sign your letters threatening hardship and penalties on your fellow man, without even bothering to make sure that there is a valid debt in the first place.  I�m sure that�s what your parents wanted for you when you were growing up, your mother must be so proud.\n\nDisclaimer:  the rape baby birthday party is not an event I celebrate...but it's always fun to stick it to those that do...just to reveal a small part of the hypocrisy...for education purposes only, of course ;-)",
