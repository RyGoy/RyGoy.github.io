That doesn't mean everything else they say is true!\n\nIf the free-dumbers say something Scott Duncan says, they are only saying it to create a TRUTH that they can attach a LIE to.\n\nThat's the thing about TRUE things; They are TRUE everywhere.\n\n2+2=4, both here, and in India, is TRUE.\n\nChristianity isn't TRUE, because if you go to India, IT'S NOT TRUE.\n\nScott Duncan taught you what is TRUE. You don't get to add yur lies as a coating and call it \"better\".",
