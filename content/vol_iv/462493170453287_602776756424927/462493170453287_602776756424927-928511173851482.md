   "message": "Scott has an interesting way of motivating people.  He points at someone who is having relative success with something he has taught them, and then \"wonders\" why you are not doing as well (given the fact that you've received the same information).  It is annoying to me that this works just about every time.\n\nLee, \"Lead, follow, or get out of the way!\" - this only reminds me of Idiocracy.  David-Paul, Pete was around when the information he has assimilated was being created, yet the information is already published now.  Hence giving yourself \"x\" numbers of months or years to catch-up is stupid.  Just read the information and ask questions as required.  As regards Anibal, the conversation he referenced regarded his inability to influence the incumbent religious population, especially as it relates to their inability to view anything he's saying as sane.\n\nSome of you are so concerned with how people will perceive you that you say little, or nothing.  If you're right, why would you possibly care?  If you're wrong, same question.  We already think some of you are retarded so you have no way to go but up.  If you're learning something, anything, you're not going to be good at it to start.  So stop worrying about it, and just do it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZXsQAXx_ao0",
