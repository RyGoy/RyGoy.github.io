   "message": "This may be the only answer left. There is no honour left in the courts. A competant individual may no longer invoke his remedy to de facto and arbitrary authority. There are no Sheriffs to call upon, the Justice system is run by a war criminal (Peter \"humanitarian bombs\" MacKay) and those tasked with upholding the public trust are in collusion with the banksters and corporate entities that openly seek to destroy every good in this world. Kill em all and let the maggots sort them out.",
