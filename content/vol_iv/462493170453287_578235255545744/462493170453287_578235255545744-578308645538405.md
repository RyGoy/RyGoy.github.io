   "message": "I value your life too, what value will life itself have when we've been turned into turnips and turds used to fertilize their fantasies. I do not intend on using violence until I have no choice. Choice is quickly becoming a non issue, we have no choice other thtan to use equal and opposite force. Strike the equal, we need serious weapons, Derek Moran was wonderfully belligerent when he stood before council and voiced his opinion, had he used a grenade instead of words the revolution would have begun that moment. I don't want to resort to violence, I just see no other option.",
