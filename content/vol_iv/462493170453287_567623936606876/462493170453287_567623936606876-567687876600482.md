   "message": "While vacationing in Prague I took a tour of a large museum which housed countless devices of torture.  Half way through the tour  my stomach was turning, I felt nauseous, and was on the verge of crying.   I couldn't believe humans were capable of such cruelty.  95% of the instruments were used by the church, or people professing to be of god.  The majority of the victims had not committed any crime, but simply disagreed with the church doctrine.",
