   "message": "Well Scott, \"freedom of choice\" is something VERY important to \"The Tender For 'Tards\". Maybe being \"bright\" is not part of their job description. Even under \"threats\", some of the 'Tards at TT4R, will choose being retarded above all cost. \n\nCreating TT4R2 is retarded. (Talk about lack of original thought)\n\nCreating \"The Tender for 'Tards 2\", and inviting Ceit Butler, and Lou Manotti to join... is going FULL RETARD!\n\nAnd we all know to... NEVER GO FULL RETARD! Remember Sean Penn in \"I am Sam\". You might go home empty handed.",
