   "message": "\"Notice of Mistake or Discharge...\"\n\nSo I received this today... It is NOT relating to my previous encounter with them. This happened 2 weeks later... (I must sound like a right troublemaker!)\n\nI was asked to pull in due to having no tax disc on the car (The Guard actually passed me, then having seen the lack of disc, turned his lights on and pursued me along a road through a housing estate until finally catching up to me and signalling at me to pull over.)\n\nI was close to home so I pulled into the drive. Not wanting to have the car taken from me again I gave the license when asked. He went to his car for a few mins then returned and gave me the license back stating, \"If you had have pulled in anywhere else I'd take that car off ya\"... I thanked him for not doing so and they left...\n\nMy first thoughts are to issue the Notice of Mistake as I have clearly mislead An Garda Siochana into thinking I want to engage in a commercial contract with them as a party with surety. Pete Daoust will obviously opt to encourage the discharge approach :p\n\nSo any thoughts please share. I'll probably opt for the Notice but just thought I'd share with the group anyway. I haven't used the NoM yet so it will be interesting to see what they say...",
