   "message": "In the strictest technical sense, a cheque is an instruction from you to your bank, to pay a quantity of money out of your account to someone you have named.\n\nOnce you have issued a cheque to your creditor, he can if he wishes collect this money by submitting the cheque before a teller at an office of your bank. Your account will be debited for the amount concerned, and he will receive the money.\n\nBut most of the time, he will deposit it in his own account and let his bank make the necessary arrangements with your bank. Your account will be debited, and his account will be credited, for the amount concerned...\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo by sending the BoE to the bank they exchange that currency into money of account and AN GARDA SIOCHANA's account is thus able to be credited...\n\nI think I'm understanding it. It'll be great if it works! :D",
