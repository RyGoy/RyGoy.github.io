   "message": "Be prepared to go to the wall on this Eamonn O Brien. After I sent the NoM, they ignored and sent back a letter saying that they accepted the not guilty plea and set a court date. I went there for answers on the court date and was arrested and lead out in handcuffs and told not to come back. They said that the charges had been dismissed. It was funny actually. The notice of mistake works. They just don't want to give in. They want to know how far you will push it. I was prepared to, if needed, staple copies to all 3, clerk, fake crossdresser, and prosticutors foreheads if that's what it took to get them to read it. They really hate losing!",
