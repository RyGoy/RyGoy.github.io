   "message": "From Scott Duncan: \"The court must accept forgiveness because that is what the Authority must do. That is what gives authority. When you make a mistake there is no hostile intent, and since there is no hostile intent in a mistake, the court cannot �Claim Conflict.� So if you cannot forgive, you HAVE NO AUTHORITY!\" There you have it. And that's the kind of day it's been this 23rd day of December, 2013. From Scott to you, VIA me, you're welcome.",
