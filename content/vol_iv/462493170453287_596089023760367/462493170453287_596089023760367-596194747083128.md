   "message": "From what I understand, being that we are shareholders of the \"country\" we live in, and dividends of the revenues of the resources, etc. is the CREDIT to which these DEBTS can be discharged. Basically since real currency is gone, we can only pay a debt through this CREDIT. Otherwise, like a collection agency we could PURCHASE a DEBT (privately).
