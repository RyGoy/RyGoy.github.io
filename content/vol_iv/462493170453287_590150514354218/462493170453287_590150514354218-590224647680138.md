   "message": "The Supreme Imaginary Friend thread...loving it Pete Daoust!!! :D\n\nMaybe you have uncovered the cause of ALL the world's problems. \n\nIf they talk about the supremacy of a Christian God, is that discrimination against a Muslim God, or Pagan Gods, or Hindu Gods?...\n\nDoes it include the lesser Gods, minor deities etc...this could open A LOT of lawsuits for exclusion, non inclusion and outright discrimination...\n\nMaybe you wan to add the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (that Canada is a signatory to), Article 18:\n\n'Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.'\n\nDoes that mean, if you can change religion at will, you can CHANGE the supremacy of God at will? :P",
