   "message": "Hey Scott Duncan...\nThe BC issued to my parents is in the spelling : Jason Fredrick Le Blanc... Not \nJASON FREDRICK LE BLANC...\nMy comprehension thus far is...The BC issued to the descendants of the vets have a BC with all the Benefits and no Liability for answering the call to arms issued by the Queen at the beginning of the War... \nSo my grandfather, who died when my father was a young man,  was a vet... \nI just now grasped the importance of benefits without liability... been pondering for a while now.\nThey have successfully conned me over and over again... until I arrived here...\nSo understanding the ramifications of this has thrown me into a really weird place. Never been here...\nI have spent my life so far accepting surety, for something that isn't mine.. because of ignorance and 3 card monty game played by The Government. It truly is fucked up.\nSo Thanks...",
