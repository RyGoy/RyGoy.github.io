The individual who makes the gift is known as the donor, and the individual to whom the gift is made is called the donee.\n\nIf a gratuitous transfer of property is to be effective at some future date, it constitutes a mere promise to make a gift that is unenforceable due to lack of consideration. A present gift of a future interest is, however, valid.\n\nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/gift",
