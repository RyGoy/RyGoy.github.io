   "message": "I think the trust should be registered with CRA/IRS....heres my logic.  There is a box on an ss-4 that says \"for banking purposes\".  I think that is how to lodge a LIEN for the beneficiaries.  :-)  So, if an account is opened using trust property, the Beneficiary better have Lien on it to secure the 1/10 of the law in its benefit.  and I think this is how it is done..thoughts?",
