   "message": "I recently learned from Scott that a fucking BENEFICIARY has no STANDING. NONE! Any fucking \"superior court\" justice who states otherwise is accomodating FRAUD. Commencing civil litigation against a TRUSTEE in their INDIVIDUAL capacity in order to undermine, violate, and or breach the trust is FRAUD. TRUST law is the highest law.
