   "message": "Ok, we have identified step 6, we have a TRUSTEE. The TRUSTEE happens to be the PERSON we created, a corporation. \n\nLet's go to 7) BY-LAWS or RULES.\n\nWhat is a BY-LAW? <<Scott Duncan: If it is a TRUST and not a PERSON WHO posts the NOTICE, it is what is known as a BY-LAW. This means that should you choose (of your own free will) to interact with the TRUST, you are subject to the BY-LAWS.>>  <<2: Establish a corporation - In the Charter, assign the role of the corporation to HOLD the trust, and establish the \"Law\" guidelines (You get to make your own up) as regards keeping the trust.>>\n\nSo just as the government has Laws (by-laws), hell we get to make our own! For both the TRUST and the CORPORATION.\n\nThat's were the part of beliefs make this impossible. We must get rid of any/all beliefs, because it's the end of knowledge, there can't be any TRUST if belief is involved, and because beliefs help maintaining the programming that we are not the absolute AUTHORITY, among many other sick shit. With beliefs, our brain would not be able to move forward, without requiring some kind of OTHER authority approving what we are doing.",
