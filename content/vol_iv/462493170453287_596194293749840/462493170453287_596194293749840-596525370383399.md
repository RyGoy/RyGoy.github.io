   "message": "Got it. \n\n     I have always been an explorer.  I break trail and sometimes get stuck and need assistance to get out.  I take risks based on, well I really do not like it here, So I go over there. I do not want to live like a slave anymore.  We cannot go down into common law, that has been changed into what we have today, Legal. \n\nSo it makes sense to create a jurisdiction (trust) in which we can operate legally and be immune to trespassers by operating under title.  \n\nAs per wishes of the Creator and Grantor expressed in a covenant.  Which Assigns the roles to play, as expressed in the Corporate charter as per wishes of the shareholders in concordance with the Covenant established at the Birth of the Trust by a simple trust agreement ( covenant).\n\nNot only that but if a historical record is established we have grounds to pursue said adversary. To hold them ACCOUNTABLE for their actions. We cannot appeal to rapists, so we need a court of competent jurisdiction  which we are the creator of.  To hit a home run.\n\nValue would be a good thing to establish as well...\nHmmm.",
