   "message": "Something else that I want to mentioned is the word COVENANT.\n\n<<Covenant\nAn agreement, contract, or written promise between two individuals that frequently constitutes a pledge to do or refrain from doing something.\n\nThe individual making the promise or agreement is known as the covenantor, and the individual to whom such promise is made is called the covenantee.\n\nCovenants are really a type of contractual arrangement that, if validly reached, is enforceable by a court. They can be phrased so as to prohibit certain actions and in such cases are sometimes called negative covenants.>>\n\nCould the TRUST AGREEMENT be a COVENANT? \n\nLet me know what you all think.",
