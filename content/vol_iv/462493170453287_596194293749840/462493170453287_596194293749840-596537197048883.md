   "message": "A side bar on words and their power from first hand experience as to the power of deception:\n\nOne came here to learn empower oneself,\nduring my preliminary investigation, I met with the head of the order. To disclose what had happened and find info \nI was given a name as to whom damaged the vessel as a young fella. The name was spelt different but sounded the same. As a result I came across the offending parties legal name in my investigation, Because I had been given a different Name that sounded the same, I literately did not see the Legal Name, I physically could not see it My mind would get cloudy and I would sink into depression.\nLong story short, I saw the name when I revisited the investigation.  My mind had cleared enough after I had de-programmed myself, with help.  \nI was deliberately misguided, they were counting on the trauma to keep their secret hidden.  It is insidious.\nAnd brutally effective.  So the layers of programming are not an easy thing to break out of, it is all around us The POWER of words ( technology) hides the truth.",
