   "message": "I said YOU, Pierre. \n\nWhat if, there is a marriage license in the picture ??  The State  can only intervene in a \"marriage\" if there is a controversy that the two parties cannot settle privately. I hope you married a good woman. That's all I have to say. Hahaha!\n\nBut I digress...\n\nLet's get back to identifying the PROPETY.\n\nYes, a TRUST may accept gifts. In a TRUST you can do WHATEVER you want, Pete. YOU ARE THE MOTERFUKING CREATOR, Pete!  You call the shots. \n\nIf you don't get that by know, you are better off keeping on acting as TRUSTEE for the government  being the sole administrator for THEIR name. :P",
