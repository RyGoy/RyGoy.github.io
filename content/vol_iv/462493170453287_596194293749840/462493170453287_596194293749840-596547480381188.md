   "message": "My understanding is that GIVEN NAMES are for COMMERCE. You cannot HOLD a TRUST with a GIVEN NAME. \nSo, I can deduce, from my notes, that it's ME, under a TAKEN NAME, that signs as SETTLOR/GRANTOR/CREATOR.\n\n<<Scott Duncan: True that. But It's really Admiral Scott (Taken Name) not any family and/or GIVEN name. I hold the AQUILAE trust, and GIVEN names are for COMMERCE.>>\n\n<<Scott Duncan: You need to CLAIM the VALUE you have contributed to the name. Lien the shit out of it, and call yourself something else. No \"given\" name. Only TAKEN names have power.>>\n\nOk, is this correct, or not? : <<So, the GRANTOR is ME, under a TAKEN NAME. And the TRUSTEE corporation, per the wishes of the CREATOR/GRANTOR, LIENS the name for ME.>>\n\nWhat do you all think? :(",
