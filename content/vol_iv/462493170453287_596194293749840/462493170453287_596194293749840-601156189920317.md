   "message": "Pete, i have established and expressed many trusts as well as collapsed a few (as have many of you ,but are unaware)...Hahaha..not everything is contracts (creditor/debtor) in as much as they are trusts, changing the \"situs\"of the private trusts has been important as well as the public trusts where i am administrating them for the legal entity. In those instances it is imperative that the roles are played correctly by the actors or there will be hell to pay...much of the time they are \"Banking\" that you are unaware that it is a trust you are dealing with as many believe they are in a contract relation-ship..",
