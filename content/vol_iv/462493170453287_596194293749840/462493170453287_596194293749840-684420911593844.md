   "message": "Re children:\n\nInstead of creating numerous trusts, why not lien the person relating to each child into the one private trust, along with the one you happen to have?\n\nThe holding corporation then acts as Sole Authorised Administrator, following the instruction of the corporate shareholder(s)...You may wish to control the corporation by holding all shares of the corporation.\n\nAs the children are considered incompetent to contract prior to age 16, then it is my understanding that you mat act as Sole Authorised Administrator on their behalf (if you are not clear on what to do with respect to liening/securing the persons into the private trust at this time).\n\nThat gives you time to learn and study so that you are fully aware of the consequences of your actions, whatever you choose to do.\n\nAct peacefully, honourably, in good faith, and know who you are (that you are a man with a person and it's not your fault) and how to administrate accordingly and you will not have any reason to concern yourself with cages.\n\nOf course, I am not qualified to give advice, so this is for entertainment purposes only ;-)",
