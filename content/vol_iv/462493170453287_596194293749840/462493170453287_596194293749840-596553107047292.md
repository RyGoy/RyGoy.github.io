   "message": "Ok, It's a 2 pronged attack:\n\n1)The formation of a trust\n2) the formation of the corporation to administer the trust and hold trust property\n\nI thought if we liened it then it was taken, looking for simplicity.\nThe taken name thing I stand corrected, I misunderstood.\nI have been trying to wrap my cocoanut around that, and it slips. So my taken name is Fredrick ( middle name) if I so choose , but when you go to fill out the forms that is not an identity recognized in their legal system,  Once set up in trust we then kill him. Is my thinking. the lien kills him",
