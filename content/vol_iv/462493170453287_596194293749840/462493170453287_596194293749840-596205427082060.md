   "message": "Trust Law is the highest form of Law. It trumps Admiralty Law, it trumps Cannon Law, is the highest Law. So that means this is SERIOUS BUSINESS... the real deal. \n\nAnyone with beliefs, it's incapable of acting in Trust Law.\n\nOk, in general, a TRUST AGREEMENT is created by a PERSON,  also called a SETTLOR/GRANTOR/TRUSTOR/CREATOR, setting up the TRUST with an specific OBJECTIVE/OBJECT, or OBJECTIVE OF THE TRUST. Usually HOLDING PROPERTY (called TRUST PROPERTY) in TRUST for a BENEFICIARY. The tasks needed to HOLD that PROPERTY are carried out by a TRUSTEE, under some BY-LAWS, or rules.\n\nSo, in a trust we have: \n\n1) A PERSON, a GRANTOR/CREATOR, setting up a TRUST.\n2) OBJECTIVE or OBJECT of the TRUST.\n3) A specific kind/variety of TRUST.\n4) PROPERTY (Trust property)\n5) BENEFICIARY\n6) TRUSTEE; and \n7) BY-LAWS or RULES.\n\nLet's start with that.",
