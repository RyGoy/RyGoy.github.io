   "message": "Stuart is correct. The beneficiaries could be ANYBODY YOU FUCKING WANT (Including, but not limited to, yourself and/or someone you TRUST, like a CORP) (hereinafter, �Beneficiaries�) for the purposes to: identify, accumulate, purchase, and/or hold all Equity and Value that become available; improve the Trust Estate so the Beneficiaries may possess the things of life sufficient to provide for health, growth, protection, education, expansion, welfare, preservation and/or a continuation thereof through a fund to extend credit and funds to the Beneficiaries; and provide for prudent administration and distribution systems for the management thereof.\"\n\nYou don't have to tell the government, or anyone outside the trust, who are the beneficiaries. Is a private matter. \n\nOk, let's move to 6) TRUSTEE. Who will be executing the tasks to HOLD that PROPERTY? Who will be TRUSTEE to the TRUST?",
