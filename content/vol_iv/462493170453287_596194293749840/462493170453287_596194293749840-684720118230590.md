I'm curious if it might be better to NOT register the new child when it arrives.'\n\nIt may be worth remembering that you are not registering a child, you are registering an event, which results in the creation of a person.\n\nAs the government stands to gain as a result of the creation of that person, they have a vested interest in that person.\n\nIn another thread, we looked briefly at the consequences of a civil death.  The end result, is whether the person is not created in the first place, or is killed off, it no longer exists in the government jurisdiction.\n\nThe child is not recognised as a person and is therefore not subject to, nor protected by the 'law'...in the same way as indigenous Australians were not and suffered atrocities without any legal protection or recourse.\n\nRegistering the event and then securing the chattel property into a jurisdiction You control (private trust held by a corporation) or even using the existing system, probably affords more control and protection than not registering the event.\n\nSo long as you, acting on the child's behalf (prior to age of majority) know how to navigate the waters and teach them how to do the same, there is a degree of legal protection until the child is old enough to make an informed decision.\n\nIf the government is giving/gifting a person for our exclusive use, even if I do not wish to be part of their system most of the time, the person becomes a useful tool in the toolbag, and is becoming more important now that I'm learning how to use it properly. \n\nThose are just my thoughts.  I do not have children yet so this is still a theoretical exercise for me.",
