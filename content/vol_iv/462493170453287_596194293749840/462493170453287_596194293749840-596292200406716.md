   "message": "But since we don't want to start crazy, we just want some basic by-laws, that we can change/modify as we please. Just like the government does! :D It's our creation, we are the AUTHORS that have the AUTHORITY, and we can change this AT WILL.\n\nSo, I say we have identified the 7 ingredients for the cake.\n\nThe government just needs a COURTESY NOTICE of the existence of the TRUST, That's it. The rest is up to us. Matters of private trust. They don't get all the details of our business, just like we don't get all the details of their business. I think thanks fair! :D\n\nMeaning, we can get the ball rolling, without having fined tuned all the details of by-laws, and other things, and we can change those as we go along.\n\nI really wish if their is something that is incorrect in all this, that someone would come in and correct it. \n\nThat's what I've got so far.",
