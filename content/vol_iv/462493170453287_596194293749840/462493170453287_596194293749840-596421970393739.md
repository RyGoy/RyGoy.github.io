   "message": "Bobis Youruncle, I just want to clear something. \n\nA Trust can be formed, without the BENEFICIARY even knowing he/she/they are the BENEFICIARIES. In a trust, the BENEFICIARY has NO POWER, nor can make any decisions. In a TRUST everything is done per the WISHES of the GRANTOR/CREATOR, which is us.\n\nDo we, as BENEFICIARIES, have any wishes carried-out by the state, of the TRUST our parents help to form? NO! We did not create it, we do not control it, as BENEFICIARIES  we have no power within the TRUST. We just take the benefit, nothing else.\n\nSo in our position, we technically know we are the beneficiaries, but in a TRUST, things are not done per the wishes of the beneficiary, but rather the wishes of the CREATOR/GRANTOR.\n\nI know what you meant to say, but like you said, we have to be careful about the words we use, and how we use them. I just wanted to mention it. It will look pretty bad if in a communication you, or anyone, expresses \"the wishes of the beneficiary\" for a trust.\n\nCheers, mate! You are breaking the ice for many of us!",
