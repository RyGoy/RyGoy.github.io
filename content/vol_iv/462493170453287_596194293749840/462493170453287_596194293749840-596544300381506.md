   "message": "So, the GRANTOR is ME, under a TAKEN NAME. And the TRUSTEE corporation, per the wishes of the CREATOR/GRANTOR, LIENS the name for ME.\n\nDoes anyone have a different answer?\n\n<<Scott Duncan: True that. But It's really Admiral Scott (Taken Name) not any family and/or GIVEN name. I hold the AQUILAE trust, and GIVEN names are for COMMERCE.>>\n\n<<Mackximus Minimus: I have a question for Scott Duncan:\n\n1) You had mentioned in a previous post that sending an \"Affidavit of Affirmation\" to the Register of Demographics Office (that's the name of the agency that issues surety bonds here) claiming the PERSON, would be sufficient to cover \"MY\" obligation. Would this process be sufficient to place a LIEN on the PERSON?\n\nAnd if so, who makes the CLAIM, \"ME\" with my TAKEN NAME as a MAN, and/or a proxy?\n\nThanks for any time to respond, Admiral.\n\nScott Duncan: Rogue Support Inc. did it for me.>>\n\n <<Scott Duncan: You need to CLAIM the VALUE you have contributed to the name. Lien the shit out of it, and call yourself something else. No \"given\" name. Only TAKEN names have power.>>",
