I knew EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I KNEW, was wrong. incorrect, a lie. I had NOTHING to start with. Just music, and \"farming\".\n\nSo I have taken VERY seriously learning the program that Scott has been giving us. It has been a struggle, no doubt. But it has been THE BEST thing that has happened to my life, besides my family. I would hate to become the Puerto Rican version of Sir Mika, but with a wife, and 3 kids. That shit is not gonna fly, Hahaha!\n\nSo, this is all that I have been feeding my brain since late February of this year. This shit is POWERFUL. \n\n<< Scott Duncan: THE Creator has the SUPREME law. YOU are THE creator. \"God\" is an invention by the nobility to FILL that \"THE CREATOR\" spot, so you will think you aren't entitled.>>",
