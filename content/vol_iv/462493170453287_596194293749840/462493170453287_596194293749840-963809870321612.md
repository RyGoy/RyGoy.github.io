   "message": "I would go about the trusts a little differently though. Not that what I've seen here, so far anyway, won't work, but I feel there is probably a better way to protect assets and limit liability than taking my trust into a public Jurisdiction. I don't know about Canada but down here that's how they piece through your trust and attach their claims to its assets.",
