   "message": "See we need just enough clubhouse to take us out of the clubhouse... too much clubhouse disturbs my own clubhouse which has the Kool Aid I like.\n\nMy own recipe, once I have left the clubhouse I thought I could be part of, but since I didn't let them paddle my ass and do a bunch of homo erotic weird shit as part of some weird college ritual called frosh, they wont let me play. \nWhich is fined by me. \n\nLike I said, just enough clubhouse to keep me out of theirs.",
