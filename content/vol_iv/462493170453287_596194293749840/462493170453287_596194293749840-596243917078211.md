   "message": "Me too...\n\nI think the Corporation becomes the holder of the trust (this is who Scott referred to as the person you can trust...you created them & made yourself sole shareholder and/or director)...the shareholders are the ones who extract value from the trust (beneficiaries)\n\nThe Board of Trustees are the same roles as the Board of Directors of a corporation (I think).\n\nThe shareholder(s) vote on and instruct the board of Directors/trustees as to the policy of the trust/corporation....but the shareholders carry no liability for the actions of the corporation & the director(s) carry limited liability.\n\nYou can wear more than one hat for this process",
