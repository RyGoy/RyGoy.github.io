You direct the corporation as FIRST DIRECTOR, and establish roles (President/CEO Vice President, etc) which is how the UNITED STATES was formed... \n\n... The accountant EXECUTES YOUR TASKS within the framework. To establish a trust, write it down, and have it witnessed and notarized. The end. Only shareholders of your corporation are recognized by the trust.>>\n\nSo, the accountant is the one to EXECUTE OUR TASKS within the framework of the corporation, Bobis.",
