   "message": "So, we have the 7 basic ingredients for the cake. I still have questions concerning BY-LAWS. But I know we can come back to that ingredient.\n\nIf there are no shit stains in this thread, we are making good progress. I REALLY WISH that, if there is some bullshit here, for someone to come clean, and correct it. :(  \n\nSo, maybe next we can talk about 1) what is a LIEN, 2) HOW to place the LIEN, 3) how to perfect the LIEN, 4) how to RATIFY the TRUST, 5) how to perfect the TRUST, and 6) how to SECURE the TRUST?\n\nJust some suggestions.",
