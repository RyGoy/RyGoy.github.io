And at the end lies another reason why we MUST not use their fucking names.\n\n<<Chip Douglas: So if my current slavemaster is say CHIP ERNIE DOUGLAS, and i dont like my middle-name ERNIE; im going to change that to BERT...and my new slavemaster will be CHIP BERT DOUGLAS. And its my NEW slavemaster because, im the one who invented CHIP BERT DOUGLAS, instead of The Crown this time around who were the ones who created CHIP ERNIE DOUGLAS?\n\nScott Duncan: TAKE a name, don't use a GIVEN one, because names are NOT GIFTS in law. They are ACCOUNTS.>>",
