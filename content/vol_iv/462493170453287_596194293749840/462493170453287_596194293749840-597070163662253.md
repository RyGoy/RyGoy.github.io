Everything is administrated and or signed either by corporate Seal or acting as first Director with taken name, taken names are the only ones that count , the others are names of accounts, you do not want to be associated with the given name any more, so by parking it it the position, it is around but silent..\nit secures your limited liability acting under title.\nWe chose director as a tile Instead of President, CEO\nfor clout purposes; when sealing documents and since all communications: come from the board of directors \n( policy) it makes sense to use title of director... it can be defined by the covenant and implemented in corporate charter.\nThis way I trust everyone involved :-D   \nAnd it secures the limited liability and keeps me safe, Enabling the ability to receive benefits created as set out in proper process.",
