   "message": "Admirals Hold the Navy's TRUST. If you TRUST someone, and they need something, they have but to ASK.\n\nORDERS and COMMANDS are for immediate execution. Asking a captain to do something is TREATED as an order, but it is simply a request... Which you ALWAYS say \"Yes\" to, if you know what's good for you. The other Captains in the navy will turn on you. If you don't TRUST the Admiral, you don't trust THEM.",
