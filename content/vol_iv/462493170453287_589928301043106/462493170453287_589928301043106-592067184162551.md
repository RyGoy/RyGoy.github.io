   "message": "Ourselves and our surety are up for grabs until we claim them for ourselves.  By Killing our worth and shifting the asset of ourselves to someone that is trustworthy and will keep  their word.   Harming ourselves for the benefit of ourselves.  The vessel is guided by a Chart, a course...\nA charter and a covenant for the benefit of the author.\nif one does not do that then based on what we know, strangers will run the course for us.  However we do not know how to navigate these waters and have to be shown... \nIn a remedial fashion due to our programming, which is our fault for being born into. Our ignorance is just that ours, self inflicted.  To what end does one pursue this path... to harm ourselves in the eyes of the governments and their corporate sponsors, who would like to keep us, safe or in a SAFE...\nMake your own safe...\nor fling poo.
