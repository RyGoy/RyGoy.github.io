   "message": "Scott Duncan It takes knowledge and original thought to engineer this 300 year old monstrosity.\n\nPeople with \"beliefs\" don't have original thought. Their brain actually FIGHTS it.\n\nScott Duncan There is NO SUCH THING as an \"innocent\" Noble. ANYWHERE.\n\nScott Duncan WE ALL KNOW.\n\nI want that VERY clear.\n\nI'll say it again.\n\nWE ALL KNOW\n\nScott Duncan No we don't.\n\nIt's no different than exploiting those physically weaker than you.\n\nScott Duncan We don't deserve it. We haven't the right.\n\nScott Duncan That's the worst part. It's born into... BY TREATY. You know, those things we like to ignore and/or downplay when natives are involved?\n\nScott Duncan The Queen can grant Knighthood, but that's as close as you will get.\n\nScott Duncan You have to know who to shoot.\n\n...and when you DO, the other Nobles get twitchy and start killing people.\n\nScott Duncan ...ask the Irish.",
