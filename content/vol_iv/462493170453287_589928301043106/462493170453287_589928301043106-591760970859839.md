   "message": "It ACTUALLY started about 5000 years ago. The \"Abrahamic\" Monotheist religions are all just plagiarizations of each other (they keep re-writing them) with ONE PRIMARY GOAL. The Subjugation of WOMEN.\n\nBefore the Abrahamic religions, the concept of \"women as property\" didn't exist. Women were GODS in the older mythologies.\n\n...so ask yourself; WHY go through all this trouble to subjugate women? What for?\n\nAll your answers will become clear after that.",
