   "message": "After a successful  international killing (here at TT4L we GO big on proxies to do that), I endured the first day of  Dean's seminar. There is SO MANY free-dumbs, I wish I was the one crushed by the train. I'm \"praying\" for them. :D\n\nIt was an honor to meet Admiral Scott Duncan, and his crew. Joking aside, I was treated in his jurisdiction with much respect. Thank you! MUCH better that in \"Canada's\" jurisdiction. \n\nWhen arriving at \"Canada\", and immigration found out I was going to a Dean Clifford seminar, they \"detained\" me, and my person, for 2 and a half hours, got profiled, and my person was ordered to leave \"Canada\" by Monday. I am NOT joking. It's a TRUE story. \n\n:D",
