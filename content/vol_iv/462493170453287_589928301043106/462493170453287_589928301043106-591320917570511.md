It's only 4 words.\n\nALL BELIEF IS EVIL\n\nagain...\n\nALL BELIEF IS EVIL\n\nVERTICALLY!\n\nALL\nBELIEF\nIS\nEVIL\n\nKeep it simple.\n\nP.S. - The crew and I really enjoyed you and Chris Evan dropping by, chatting and then... I THINK you guys killed someone. Not sure why THAT was something you guys got from my conversation, but hey, it's your trip, and there's too many people in the world... Bonus points for using a train. Trains and homicide are always a hit.\n\nYour body count is higher than mine this week. Good for you :D",
