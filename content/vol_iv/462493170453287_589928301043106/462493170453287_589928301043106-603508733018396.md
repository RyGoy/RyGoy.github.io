   "message": "Scott Duncan Admirals don't give orders. Captains do.\n\nChris Evan What do Admirals do?\n\nScott Duncan Admirals Hold the Navy's TRUST. If you TRUST someone, and they need something, they have but to ASK.\n\nORDERS and COMMANDS are for immediate execution. Asking a captain to do something is TREATED as an order, but it is simply a request... Which you ALWAYS say \"Yes\" to, if you know what's good for you. The other Captains in the navy will turn on you. If you don't TRUST the Admiral, you don't trust THEM.\n\nScott Duncan Admirals ENABLE Captains. That is their job.\n\nScott Duncan Addressing a superior is always SIR (Regardless of gender), and a subordinate is always MISTER (Yes, regardless of gender).\n\nPierre Eleveneightfivetwo So, in other words, a rank is a PERMISSION you have, not a title ?\n\nScott Duncan YES.\n\nScott Duncan Being a Captain gives you autonomy, but there is safety in numbers. An Admiral manages those numbers and enables them to function collectively.\n\nScott Duncan It's his boat. He makes the rules.\n\nScott Duncan The ADMIRAL'S jurisdiction is the COMMON RULES shared among ALL the Captains.",
