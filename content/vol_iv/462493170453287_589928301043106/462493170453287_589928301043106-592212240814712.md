   "message": "I see gold here. I too must admit that EARLY ON I felt as if there was a lot of attitude flowing from Scott. I have since seen, through READING, that it isn't so much arrogance. I can see his hate for stupid and beliefs. As there are people in my life that fit those categories and even with my much more limited knowledge, I am beginning to the fights with them and their laziness and inability to accept that their \"authority\" might be misleading, at best, for their benefit. All of this being done using WORDS and a little \"no, that doesn't apply here\". The hard part for me is how to get acceptance of what I do know to be true. As I build on this knowledge, I hope to correct this and get more valuable to me and my family than that fiat paper.",
