   "message": "Scott Duncan Since 1982, it's FOLLOW THE MONEY. It's ALL ACCOUNTING and SURETY.\n\nScott Duncan Now the Nobles and the Banks are at war. Nobody even notices.\n\nDino Quiring I have been having a lot of trouble comprehending SURETY. Is it the slaves presumed earnings in their lifetime has been leveraged, traded and monetized?\n\nDino Quiring In commerce, it seems simple.\n\nScott Duncan Yes.\n\nI can say \"Next year my slaves can produce 100 bushels of cotton\".\n\nI know that's not much, but they are black, and I don't beat them, so they aren't really productive...\n\n...still, I can SECURITIZE that and SELL that prediction on the market. I will need Sambo, Toby and Abooikuh to facilitate it, so I put their names down on the security instrument.\n\n...if those slaves don't produce what I promised, they will have to work off the balance on another plantation!\n\nI hope that was clear/tasteless enough.",
