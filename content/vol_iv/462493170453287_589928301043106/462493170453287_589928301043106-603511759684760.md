   "message": "Scott Duncan Math and science do not require \"belief\" They require KNOWLEDGE and UNDERSTANDING.\n\nEvil is a lack of empathy.\n\nScott Duncan You people make up such convoluted bullshit for the simplest things. You run the Nobility's Programming VERY well.\n\nScott Duncan Dino Quiring: Belief is NOT trust.\n\nOnly theists think that.\n\nALL BELIEF IS EVIL. ALL BELIEF IS BASED ON STOPING THE THOUGHT PROCESS.\n\nIn case you missed it: ALL BELIEF IS EVIL and serves someone else.\n\nScott Duncan One of the key components to the Noble Lie is the merging of \"belief\" and Trust. They try to give it the same value.\n\nThey do the same with \"Faith\" and knowledge.\n\nScott Duncan This is why you see Christians pretending they have knowledge and thinking those who have no imaginary friend are \"ignorant\".\n\nThey TRULY BELIEVE their \"faith\" is equal to ACTUAL knowledge. They REALLY DO.\n\nScott Duncan Research the SCIENTIFIC METHOD. ACTUALLY research it. These things have already occurred to people. Sadly you don't have any original insight. You can't. You have been programmed.\n\nThe Scientific Method is your start.",
