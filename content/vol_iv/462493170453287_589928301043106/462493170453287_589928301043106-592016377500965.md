   "message": "Yes.\n\nI can say \"Next year my slaves can produce 100 bushels of cotton\".\n\nI know that's not much, but they are black, and I don't beat them, so they aren't really productive...\n\n...still, I can SECURITIZE that and SELL that prediction on the market. I will need Sambo, Toby and Abooikuh to facilitate it, so I put their names down on the security instrument.\n\n...if those slaves don't produce what I promised, they will have to work off the balance on another plantation!\n\nI hope that was clear/tasteless enough.",
