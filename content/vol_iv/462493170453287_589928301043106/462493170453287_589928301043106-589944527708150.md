   "message": "I agree that even thou \"you guys are good\", no one has the right to take advantage of those that have a different genetic pool, and are not as \"smart\" as others.\n\nIf it's an invention of nobility (many things like \"god\", and \"religions\", forms of \"government\", etc), why are you so angry at the \"weak\" ones, the ones being used? \n\nI admit that we deserve what we ask for. We are lazy, and disconnected from reality. \n\nWould it not be sane to think: \"Spreading all this bullshit to control and abuse others is really creating a fucking disaster. Some have claimed dominion over the earth, and are totally leaving us out in the split. How about we start shooting a few nobles in the head, maybe some real shit can start happening.?\"",
