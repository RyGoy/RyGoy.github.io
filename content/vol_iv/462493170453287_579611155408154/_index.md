This is where I get Hazy,@what Point does the paper work, become an Inchoate Instrument?? Or do I say right off the Bat that Im going to use a BOE to pay for said Truck??? Are there any files etc that will explain this situation. I want to put into action this Knowledge, and NOT use it for A Dust Collector!!! Constructive Criticism Welcome!!",
