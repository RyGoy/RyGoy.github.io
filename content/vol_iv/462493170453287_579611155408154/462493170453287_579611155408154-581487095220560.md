   "message": "In relation to discharge with the signature as Bev mentioned. Debt/Obligation is money in this system. The signature is obligation. When you indorse the back of a cheque/negotiable instrument what has happened?\n\nAlso a debt/account settled and closed in the private with value is a setoff. But a debt discharged with another debt instrument is an account still open but temporarily deactivated awaiting a future settlement.",
