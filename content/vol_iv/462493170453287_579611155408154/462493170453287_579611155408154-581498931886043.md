   "message": "I discharged my mortgage with an EFT on a closed checking account. Wells Fargo accepted the EFT, zero balanced my online banking statement, and then a couple of weeks later reversed my banking statement. They then sent me a letter stating that they weren't going to accept the payment and \"would not speak about this matter again.\" I've asked for the instrument to be returned to me untouched, which of course they haven't, and they are refusing to answer any of my requests. They did however attempt to pass off a color copy of the promissory note as the original.",
