   "message": "I am in a process of writing a nice letter concerning PIERRE DAOUST's revenu DECLARATION for 2013 to QRA. I am ASKING them what would be the amount they see fit, according to PIERRE DAOUST is situation. Apparently, they have a powerful software that gives the RIGHT numbers, and they will use it AGAINST PIERRE DAOUST anyway :D, so I'll save them time and effort :D\n\nI am a NICE guy :D\n\nOr, I'll just go ahead and declare a 600 billions revenue for PIERRE DAOUST, just to make sure I don't make an under estimate.....but that would be a lie though :(\n\nAnd I hate lying :(",
