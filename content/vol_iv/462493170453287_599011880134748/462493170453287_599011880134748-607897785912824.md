   "message": "Your love of circle-jerking to the ORIGINS of the clubhouse rules (A CLUB YOU AREN'T PART OF) cost you ALL VALUE that 5 minutes might have made.\n\nWhat's WORSE is that everyone who posted BEFORE ME couldn't see that you DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.\n\nI could stretch that 5 minutes to a half-hour without even taxing my brain. It's not because I'm smarter than you (Even though I am), it's because I'D KEEP IT SIMPLE AND FOCUS ON THE OBVIOUS!\n\nIt's REALLY disappointing that everyone ELSE is circle-jerking with you.",
