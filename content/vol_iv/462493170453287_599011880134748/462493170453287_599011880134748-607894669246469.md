   "message": "Nothing?\n\nI'll continue.\n\nOnce a month I must field grievances of the fleet. The LOWEST crew member to the highest captain, gets 5 minutes to present their case.\n\nIt's easy. Everyone has a story to tell, and has nothing to do with MY role. I just let them babble (Usually about Dan's XO) until their time is up.\n\nI SAY NOTHING, and ASK NOTHING, because if I speak, THE FUCKING CLOCK STOPS. YOUR 5 minutes, not OUR five minutes.\n\n...oh, you didn't know that, did you? THE CLOCK STOPS WHEN THEY SPEAK",
