   "message": "I LIKE THIS, re: the war is over.\n\nI've already won. The wheels are in motion, and dismissing me as \"crazy\" is as foolish as those who attached the same label to me when cryptographic currencies were invented 6 years ago.\n\nI lost a LOT of \"friends\" when I said it was viable and I was dedicating effort full time to it. Those that stayed are reaping the rewards while others starve.\n\nNOT BAD for a FUCKING ALPHA TEST\n\nYour OWN currency is next.\n\nThen an overlay network to act as an \"Interac\"-like system. No lawyers. No government. No cops. ALL VALUE. NO DEBT.",
