   "message": "We received a \"Property tax assessment notice\" then an \"Overdue Notice\". We are not ones who don't pay, however, we are also not comfortable signing any of \"their\" offers/notices nor do we want any presumptions made that we are holding any office for them on our property. We did not detach the top portion and keep it for our records. We did send it back registered mail, addressed to the finance minister personally, with \"We do not understand the nature and causes of these notices, however, we wish to settle the account with the enclosed cheque\" and \"this is a matter of public record #bla bla bla\". Had three witnesses sign. We signed the top portion with all rights reserved as the equitable title holders. The cheque sent had the amount that just so happened to be the home owner grant amount. The cheque also stated on the \"memo\" line \"to settle account #bla bla bla\". We did not receive anything back , however, the cheque was cashed. Any corrections Scott? Would you suggest following up? I would think they have accepted our offer and understand us, as that is what we told him to do.",
