   "message": "I think sharing a little side story here may be appropriate; One day I was shovelling shit, because I actually like to, and as I was transporting a wheelbarrow full of it out of the pasture the dogs started barking up the driveway. A few seconds later a car pulled up that I did not recognize. We have bails of old hay blocking part of the driveway for target practice, so the vehicle stopped there and I approached as the stranger exited his vehicle. With clipboard in hand he began by introducing himself, \"I am so and so with property assessment BC and..\" To which I interrupted, \"Oh, No thank you. Good bye.\" He tried to say something else along the lines \"So I can assume nothing has changed...\" \"You may assume nothing. Now good bye.\" He started on about how everyone has to pay property tax to which I responded, \"No thank you. Good bye.\" He then grabbed his camera and took a photo (I say took because I would have never given him one) while kind of asking for my permission in a round about way. I said, \"You are going to have to pay for any photos.\" He then jumped into his car and backed the 1/4 km out of the driveway. He then informed the neighbor that, \"They're kind of scary down that driveway.\" He was easily one and a half my size. Maybe it was the bails of hay that scared him.",
