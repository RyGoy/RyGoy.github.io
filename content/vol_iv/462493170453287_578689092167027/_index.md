   "message": "Electric Bill of Exchange�.\nThe whole story\n\nJuly 2012, last time I�ve bought back one of the bill\n\nNovember 1st, 2012 Hydro-Quebec calls me, I said I did not have any of these Bank Notes available for the moment :P\n\nJanuary 2013, Hydro-Quebec decide to put PIERRE DAOUST in collection (They have their OWN collection department) and threatening to cut the service.\n\nThe same day, I wrote my first letter to them, I have read the BoE act a few times, I have watched Money as debt a few times, and something inside of me is telling me that I am onto something :D\n\nSo that first communication was pretty simple, TRUE, and to the point, no fucking freeman-on-the-land bullshit, and no $5000 words, that I don�t even understand my self :P my goal is NOT to look smart, and I am sure EVERYONE in here will agree on this :D , my goal is THE TRUTH, I never changed that WHY I am here�..and hey, if the TRUTH is I AM A SLAVE, wel, so be it, bring the chains for fuck sakes�. :D\n\nKEY points of that letter�.\n1). I tell them that I have received their NOTICE and THREATS.\n2). And apparently, I have a debt with them (I was NOT totally aware of who I was at that time :D )\n3). Assure them that IF I owe, I want to pay\n4). But I have NO ACCESS to Fiduciary Money ( Bank Notes) for the Moment\n5). I am SCARED that they cut the service, I have lots of children inside the house and your threats scares me very much :P\n6). Is there ANY other payment or remittance method AVAILABLE to me ? :D\n7). I OFFER to cut your grass and or wash your windows if it can help\n\nThat was the first letter :D and guess what ?  NO ANSWER, but PIERRE DAOUST got out of their collection department, oh the mystery !!!!, so I knew and felt that I was ONTO something, I have shared this in TTFL, and Scott Duncan said: You have NO IDEA how funny this is Pierre, and I replied, you�re right, I have no idea. \n\nApril 2013 shows up, I receive ANOTHER bill of exchange from them with some threats attach to it :D , I send the SAME exact letter, but I add on it: SECOND REQUEST :P\n\nAnd the same thing happen again�.complete silence on their side, and PIERRE DAOUST don�t seems to be in their collection target.\n\nJuly arrived :D, I pick up a Bill of Exchange in PIERRE DAOUST�s mail box, and now, after reading and reading, and THINKING and THINKING�.(I think more than I read), I know who I am :D �. And hit them with a NOTICE stating that this is the 3rd request I make, I am really disappointed about their complete silence, the BoE act tell that they HAVE to answer me, and they have 10 days to answer, or I will have to proceed with the comprehension I have, and they will have to accept :P\n\nNO ANSWER, so August the 6th, I have ADMINISTRATED and complete that Bill of Exchange, sent the original to Bank of Canada, and a copy to Hydro-Quebec.\n\nAnd then, September the 17th ( a Saturday morning), the phone�s ring, so I pick up the phone and say: HELLOSSS!!!! :D\n\nThat guy at the other end says: MISTER PIERRE DAOUST PLEASE, I said My name is Pierre, he said hi my name is so and so from Hydro-Quebec and I would like to answer your questions and help�. :D , I said OK, go ahead�HAHAHAHA!!!!, he said well, heuh, what�s you questions ?, I said do you have my communications I sent you via registered mail ?, he said one of them, I said have you read it ?, and the he started the SKATING fucking game, it was HILARIOUS, I have a recording of this, in French, and at one point I said wow wow wow, stop that please and send me all this in writing, he refused, he said he don�t have the RIGHT to send documents in writing, I said well, that is too bad :D\n\nAnyway, the day after, I wrote a beautiful letter :D ,  I tell them that one of their agent called the person I happen to have in my pocket, and tried to either fraud, confuse, or install some controversies in PIERRE DAOUST�s affairs, and from now on, I will ONLY accept ALL communications via mail.\n\nI said, If ever you want to REFUSE the administrating process I used, as the sole authorized ADMINISTRATOR for PIERRE DAOUST, you have to ADVISE me in writing AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\n\nI said, BANK of Canada, haven�t contacted me about any defect and/or refusal from their part.\n\nI said, if you need a copy of the audio recording of this phone calls for your file, I can send one to you via email :P\n\nyou have 10 days to NOTICE me of a fault, defect or refusal concerning the administration process of that bill of exchange, If I don�t hear from you, I will UNDERSTAND that this is settled and close :P\n\nNOTHING AS OF NOW !!!!\n\nI want to share this because, without really knowing it, I have used a very POWERFUL method in here�..think of that first letter I�ve sent back in January�.you see, my INTENTS are good faith all the way�.I am asking for the TRUTH�..tell me the fucking TRUTH, that�s all�.and I have good reasons to believe that when you ask something, and they don�t answer, they have something to hide��.\n\nOh, I have started TEACHING other French Frogs about all this, they start seeing me in a more serious way :D , I mean, they can laugh, but it�s been 15 months I have not played the SURETY role for this hydro bill, and same thing with 5 other bills� :P\n\nAnd I am one heck of a good teacher :D , almost as much as I am a good administrator, \n\nThanks\nPete",
