   "message": "So Scott, you said to set things up as these \"countries\" have set things up. Then I would understand that CANADA is the corporation that HOLDS ASSETS and does not operate in commerce? The gov't is a TRUST which handles commerce on behalf of CANADA? \n\nThen all corporations / persons registered within that TRUST are PROPERTY of that TRUST and all commerce done therein are interest of this TRUST?\n\nI am trying to figure out which entity acts in commerce on behalf of all. It is my understanding that an entity that HOLDS assets should not be involved in commerce at all.\n\nMy question being, do I have it all backwards? Would not the registered entity be the one involved in commerce and the TRUST does not?",
