   "message": "Beverly, in Canada do you have an option for a corporation that has \"pass through\" taxation?  Here in the States, when a corp is registered, it defaults to a C-Corp (which gets taxed then distributes the profits to the shareholders who are taxed) or we can elect to be an S-corp (the profit is distributed to the shareholders then it is taxed). Its seems that S-corp status would be the way to go for us as any tax that is levied could be discharged through the Person in Trust.  What do you think?  Does this even exist in Canada?",
