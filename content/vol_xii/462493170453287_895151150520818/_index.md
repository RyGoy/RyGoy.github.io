   "message": "Questions that will help ME purge and bring ME some clarity, and perhaps some others.   \n\nIs this Statement of Birth authentication process people are going on about worth doing or just stupid and do the parallels in brackets I inserted from reading this group make any sense? Please place this on the autopsy table and explore.   \n\nThis is my limited understanding of it so far when you have possession of the authenticated live birth statement you now possess the name and the knowledge and/or information and the rights (first hand) that the informant (accusation) originally granted as grantor (information/knowledge) bringing it from the public to the private?  (Rather than being the Carrier of, it�s now been delivered to the beneficiary) so if you possess the knowledge (the document) you have first hand knowledge rather than hearsay and own the fruit of your labor thereof if you can remain in the private. \n\nWould this perfect the title and/or make the claim to it?  Would this brass ring that binds it and attached at the provincial/state level authenticating the signature, act as a seal and not allow them to open/administrate in the public without our permission? (Affirmation sent registered mail to Registrar General making the claim and removing presumptions is good enough they can�t rebut they are not a person)",
