   "message": "Folks have likely seen the statement that  \"I swear this to be TRUE to the best of my knowledge (another lie) and BELIEF\". Remember we are taught to respect the beliefs of others. This is the mechanism used by the Attorney General and the Law Society to facilitate lying in an affidavit. \n\nWhen a JUSTICE endorses a belief put forward by lawyers these then become \"fact\", that doesn't make these LEGAL FACTS any more TRUE though.",
