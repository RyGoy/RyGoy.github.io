   "message": "The GREAT thing about the scientific method is that you can always reproduce the results.\n\nA difficult task when secrecy was the mandate, and suddenly a guy who thinks \"TELL EVERYONE\" is the default position regarding knowledge, is in charge.\n\nIt's all I've ever done. I'm a desperation option. If I'm involved, it means the people in charge are desperate, and it means the problem WILL be solved.\n\nThis is what I have always done. I don't know how to do much else.\n\nIt's a life path that does not forgive error, and the fact that I still have a pulse is all I need to show that I am VERY good at it.\n\nWe're almost gone.\n\nI intend to fix that.",
