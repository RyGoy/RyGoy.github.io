   "message": "About Ian Scott (from Wikipedia): \"He accepted a teaching position at York University, and remained in the public eye as a political panelist on television until a devastating stroke in 1993 made speech difficult for him. He developed aphasia following the stroke, and was forced to end his legal career.\"\n\nIt makes me think that \"someone\" made speech difficult for him.  :D  I may be way off....but in the same way Scott has said \"thumbs and eyes\".",
