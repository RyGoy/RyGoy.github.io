He is suspected of rape of underage citizen, if you have any information you have to disclose them now, otherwise...\"\n\n- well I don't know any person that is not a piece of paper. What are you talking about seriously?\n\n- this Scott Duncan wants to start a war, he is pro death of lawyers and enforcement authorities also, he's a threat and if you are his friend and help him, you can be complicit is his criminal behavior! \n\n- for the friend part... you are wrong I am not anyones friend. (Hehe)\nI have no idea how a piece of paper can cause such havoc. I do read sometime Creative Common text that refer to a scott duncan but this has nothing to do with the person I administrate, you should ask the administrator of the person you are looking for. \nAll these text and/or letters are as available to me as they are to you... otherwise that I have NO Authority over anything you are refering to or asking questions about...\n\n- Now you have to tell me why this alleged criminal did not do what he is suspected to have done, what do you have to say for that... he could be all that I am describing, No?\n\n-Well... no because.... [insert correct answer]\n\nI will ponder on this.",
