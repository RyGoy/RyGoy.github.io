   "message": "I read this today.  The goal of maxims is to bring LIGHT to the DARKNESS, to hold up TRUTH as the standard of fairness and thereby insure justice for everyone. Without the maxims we have no guides, no standards to promote peaceful understanding. Purposely using words with a hidden meaning, hoping others will depend on the common meaning reasonable people would expect the words to mean, thereby gaining an advantage over others, is dishonest. Courts are not free to rule any way the judge pleases. Judges must obey the law and stay within the boundaries established by maxims such as this. However there are no more judges only justices, why do I have a tingly feeling that the courts have been hijacked and this is why Scott promises to tell the truth?",
