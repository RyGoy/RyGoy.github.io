   "message": "It makes no difference to me who you are, when I started the adventure of reading the information you have shared Scott it was because I was desperately looking for truth all these years and wanted to be responsible, this journey from innocence to experience has been a wild ride for me, I was never content to just drift through life, I always remained open and receptive to new concepts, values and beliefs.  This knowledge you have shared has systematically reorganized my thought processes to a new awakening, I am using this time as a tool to rid the ignorance and share as much as i can with others.  Yesterday I was reviewing all day and most of the night and I realized that there were questions that I did not know that needed to be asked in order to understand. This light has gone off in my head and I can't shut it off.  Is this weird or what?",
