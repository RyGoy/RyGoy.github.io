   "message": "In order to connect things they need to exist. When you point to information that you don't charge for, it always relates to reality and exponential function is a proof of that.\n\nEveryone else cannot tell the truth BECAUSE they talk about fiction and unreality. That is why claim false claim would arise against you and people would believe it... \n\nBut does that explain deeply why everyone else is not saying the truth? I don't think so other the inescapable fact that it's either or it isn't (to relate to CS,as in binary 1 or 0, and cannot be 1  and 0 at once) One relate to reality the other is irrelevant. \n\nI don't know if that would save you from false accusations.",
