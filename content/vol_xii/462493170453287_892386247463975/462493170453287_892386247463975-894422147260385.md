   "message": "\"Obscurantism (/?b?skj??r?nt?sm/) is the practice of deliberately preventing the facts or the full details of some matter from becoming known. There are two common historical and intellectual denotations to Obscurantism: (1) deliberately restricting knowledge � opposition to the dissemination of knowledge, a policy of withholding knowledge from the state schools for the public; and, (2) deliberate obscurity � an abstruse style (as in literature and art) characterized by deliberate vagueness.[1][2] The adjective-name Obscurantist identifies the man or woman who actively opposes social reform and enlightenment, a type of anti-intellectual.[3]\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscurantism",
