   "message": "My brain feels like it's going to burst. I'm glad I didn't read this yesterday. I must confess Scott, when we were talking about \"Lou Minotti\" and then you had me Google the meaning of  Illuminati, after I read the definition, you admitted you were Illuminati. \n\nI didn't question this because that meaning describes you better than anything I could attempt to offer. I also did not ACCEPT this because to do so would be to simply BELIEVE you and yet I knew that there is no possible way for me to VERIFY such a claim.",
