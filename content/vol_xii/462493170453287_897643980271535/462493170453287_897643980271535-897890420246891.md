You have the State Comptroller addressing a communication to ME as the Sole Authorized Administrator. Seen by 26, liked by 7 only? \n\nWhen Robert Menard, or Dean, or Bonacci, or any fucktard on Facebook posted any shit, you would press \"like\" like your lives depended on it. NOW you have more evidence, and PROOF that what Scott has taught it's TRUE. 7 likes? :/ Really?",
