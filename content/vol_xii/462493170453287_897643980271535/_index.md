   "message": "\"Trust, but verify.\" The first time I ever read those words was here, and obviously they came from Scott Duncan.\n\nI share this, because we have a few new members since last year, and some have not had the opportunity to even reach at the begging of this group to read things, thus missing perhaps some things that have been publicly verified by members of this group. Things nobody here knew even existed... like SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR. :D And it was Scott Duncan who taught us about the AGENT within.\n\nBecoming part of this group to follow Scott's teachings has become \"a must\" part of my life, for many reasons. And I have had the opportunity to verify a few things, to the point of PROOF. You know, a SIGNATURE.\n\nLast year, I set out to, as a COURTESY, inform via NOTICE to a few AGENCIES, and the PRINCIPAL, that the Sole Authorized Administrator was now in town. Now think about this: if SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR was some \"freeman\" or crazy thing, would a public official such as... the State Comptroller, even acknowledge such TITLE? If it's something \"crazy,\" why would even respond to such communication?\n\nYes. VERIFIED! Hell, they even gave INSTRUCTIONS to the AGENT on what to do with some documents that were attached. So, Quatloosers, who is \"crazy\" now? Scott Duncan, or the State Comptroller? Hahaha! :D",
