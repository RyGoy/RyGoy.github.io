   "message": "He is talking about certain RIGHTS that EVERYONE has, but mostly are not been ASSERTED. The way to assert those rights would be via AGENCY, and it's Principal/Agent relationship, which he is missing.\n\nIn this case the word EVERYONE would equal to AGENTS, and the PRINCIPAL is the responsible party for HIS AGENTS. The PRINCIPAL is the party that must provide for \"adequate living, food, clothing, housing,...\" for HIS AGENTS.\n\nHe is wrong to believe \"we\" have millions in some account/s. It's ALL \"their\" stuff, not of our CREATION. But AGENCY can sure explain how/why is the PRINCIPAL the responsible party for EVERYONE, meaning HIS AGENTS.",
