   "message": "Who's your \"daddy\"?  \n\nIs it Scott?  Is it the government, the clergy, your corporate boss?  Do you notice something wrong and then make the necessary corrections to get things back on track, or do you grumble and wait for \"daddy\" to tell you what you should think or do?  I currently have no stake in the outcome.  I would be remiss in not mentioning, however, that the time you spend participating in pointless activities is time you won't get back.  If you don't like how something is going, change it.  In this case, one comment should suffice.  For those of you who have children or cats, look at the way they deal with distractions.  If they want something they keep coming back to it regardless of how many distractions you throw in their way.  They know what they want, and they don't lose focus.  If you think right and value the right things, a few naked pictures or jokes are not a deal breaker.  If your conversation can be derailed that easily you'll never accomplish anything.  To Pete's point, everything that needs to be said regarding this post, may have already been discussed.  This should, however, speak to the larger issue for this thread, and others.\n\nI'll start.  Comment on the subject matter, or off you fuck.",
