Clifford, had it BEFORE I BROUGHT IT HERE. They actually FOUGHT it to protect their \"revenue\" stream (Credulous Piece-of-Shit Christians). \n\nI told you I would show you an answer years ahead of EVERYONE. Most of you just went \"he's crazy\", INCLUDING Menard and Clifford.\n\nSino General expected it to die, and was thinking \"white guy scam\". I'm the only white guy who's never lied to him. I'm the exception that proves the rule. his presumption is reasonable.\n\nNow I don't know WHAT he thinks! :D \n\nHe came to Tycho Brahe to see if I was real! :D\n\nSo did Anibal Jose Baez, Chris Evan, Derek Moran, Martin Sutton, Andrew D'Aragon...\n\n...there's more but they are women, and I think they just came for the sex. :D",
