   "message": "ALL belief is EVIL...where have we heard that before :P\n\n\"Agnosticism is of the essence of science, whether ancient or modern. It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe. Consequently Agnosticism puts aside not only the greater part of popular theology, but also the greater part of anti-theology. On the whole, the \"bosh\" of heterodoxy is more offensive to me than that of orthodoxy, because heterodoxy professes to be guided by reason and science, and orthodoxy does not.[13]    ï¿½ Thomas Henry Huxley\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism",
