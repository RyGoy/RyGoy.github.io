   "message": ":D\n\nWhat is a Cult?\n\nThere is actually not a clearly defined legal definition for the term �cult.� Instead, it is generally derived from the somewhat pejorative use typical in news media coverage of non-mainstream religious groups. Most law enforcement agencies have a similar problem of determining whether a group constitutes a �cult� and, if so, what protections or legal status they might have.",
