The chain pieces/hashes are Math we can trust. Moving value.\n\nNow for the coolest part. The Blockchain is being powered by this huge golden gear with a Bitcoin code that reads \"IN BLOCKCHAIN *(MATH) WE TRUST.\" It has 9 stars, that I have no idea what they mean.  To the right of the Bitcoin code there is a sign there ? that means \"infinity.\" The machine that can't be turned off? Or is in reference to something else, like a society? I have no idea.\n\nAnd just to the left of the Bitcoin code, hidden at plain sight, it's that All Seeing Eye of the Illuminatti, pyramid and everything! Hahaha! I am not kidding, go take a closer look folks! I bet I am probably missing more things.\n\nI do not know if this happens often now to anyone here, but I see these things now all the time. They were always there, I just couldn't see.\n\n* I placed the (MATH) there. Please take notice.",
