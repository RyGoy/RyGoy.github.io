   "message": "I have a vessel. She's called AQUILAE HYAPATIA. On that vessel (mostly women) there is a 14 year-old girl. She's Indian. She's 5`1, weighs 90 lbs if she's an ounce. She could kill you before you could finish the thought \"Holy Shit, she's going to kill me\". at least 10 men learned this lesson the hard way. The women wander around Xemar (Mogadishu) with NO male escort and  REALLY like demonstrating what a bad idea it is to inflict violence on somebody of greater physical stature. That 14-year old wears the dried testicles of a man who tried to rape her, at 12.\n\nShe's also 14 and wonders why boys are afraid of her :D",
