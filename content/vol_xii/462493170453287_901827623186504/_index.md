   "message": "Can a savings account be seized without a court order? I've not heard a word from the CRA since my 2012 court case, they have now seized my savings account which I was using as deposit only and immediately removing the balance as well as transferring Group RRSP's monthly for withdrawl. Like a good admin I checked the p.o. box and no notice was given, the bank claimed to have a court order which I demanded a copy, turns out not to be a court order it's an unsigned form. In the past the CRA had sent a remittance voucher so currently I have nothing to administrate.",
