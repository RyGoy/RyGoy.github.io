   "message": "From the Scott is always right department....I happened to talk to a stranger today who happened to work for a Bank that I used to use a long time ago.  Somehow this came up in conversation as well as  moving my business to a Credit Union.  His response was \"I keep my money in a Credit Union too, but it's unfair competition as Credit Unions don't pay taxes.\"  This was at the end of the conversation and I didn't have time to ask WHAT taxes.  \n\nNot 30 seconds after this, a  colleague said that one time the IRS cleaned out his bank account for back taxes, but didn't touch his funds in a Credit Union.  \n\n:D",
