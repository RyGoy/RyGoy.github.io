   "message": "I closed my savings account with RBC as the CRA seized it, I had a fair amount in my RRSP which is group and untouchable. Without the seized account the only thing on the books was the RRSP. I probed them on the phone today and the account lien vanished with the Account. :P So I went to a branch that has never seen me or dealt with me and gave them a sob story of being toss out on the street and that I needed that RRSP monies right away, they said it takes 24hrs and I wined a little more and they changed their tune. No shit this is what happened after I claimed article 1 section 2 of the ICCPR, they said they will give me bank cash today, open a temporary account for themselves and deposit a check that I signed to remove the RRSP transfer tomorrow and give themselves back the cash. I walk out the door with 3400 and found that BTM that takes up to $8000 in one go. HaHa I win",
