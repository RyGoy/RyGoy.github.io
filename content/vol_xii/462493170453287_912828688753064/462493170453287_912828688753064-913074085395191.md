   "message": "Sorry Scott Duncan, if my page is coming off as \"chumming\" or my story is lacking details but those aren't my intentions.  I'm really not tech savvy and I'm antisocial, I've created the page literally to learn your work. While watching Dean's videos, he used to refer to some unknown source that was reliable and I used to wonder who that could that possibly be. Then when I came across Scott's page I realized he was picking bits and pieces of Scott's work and charging us money to learn it.  Part of me is still unsure how to defend myself if ever the government came after me, my intentions are to continue to learn but also keeping my family safe. I'm willing to Skype with you guys to prove I am a man of my word. If this doesn't suffice, please elaborate on which details I'm missing.",
