   "message": "It is of great sadness that there is no blockchain technologies to store AV (or is there? MaidSafe may do that in the futur I suppose)\nIt would be good to see Authorised Biography of Scott Duncan that can't be destroyed and/or stopped, im certain that the best friends of all citizen (hehe) at the law society would be thrilled by this!\n\nI think that love does stupid thing too. We love our friend in a way we give them \"carte blanche\" to be lesser humans, in general. And that is call \"accepting people as they are\". How ironic... Rappy adults that that have friend that don't exist now can tell me how to live my life. \n\nAs much is it means nothing. Thanks Scott.",
