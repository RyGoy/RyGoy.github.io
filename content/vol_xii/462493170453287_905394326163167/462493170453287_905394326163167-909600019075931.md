So he now has an invoice of $10 millions to deal with (Default notice will be sent tomorrow)\n\nHe also has a lien registered of $2 millions to deal with (Security for Cost) ...he was noticed of this....The lien was registered by the Acting Trustee, 9111-1111 Quebec Inc. Because I decided so.... :D\n\nNow, he changed the date, I have no idea why. He was suppose to be here today to steal some stuff, and he changed the date for the 17th of December.\n\nI really don't know why he did that, so we'll see..... :/",
