   "message": "In only 3 years Scott turned the members of the Tender for Law in better men, and women than all the members of the \"Law Society\" combined. We know the importance of \"Everyone is to obey the law.\" We keep our promises. We know the importance of the truth, and to despise all lies. We don't hurt strangers for money (I'm gonna reserve that right!). Plus we do not claim ownership over other men, and then pretend with tantrums that we do not.\n\nCome on and say it loud, you cowards! You claim to own men! You don't follow the rules, and selectively obey the \"law.\" YOU are the fucking \"freeman OF the land\"!",
