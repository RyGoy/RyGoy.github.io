He who owns makes they rules\n\nDid I touch a nerve perhaps?\n\nThis was done whilst having a very brief discussion about LEGAL TENDER and Crypto Currency to a couple of members of that group.  \n\nThat facebook group was brought to my attention today by a Mark Whellum who isn't a member but is following The Tender For Law. I think \nhe wanted to stir a bit with info he has gathered from here.  I could be wrong on that though",
