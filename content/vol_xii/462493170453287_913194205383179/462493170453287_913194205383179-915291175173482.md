   "message": "I may have mentioned this elsewhere, but one of my friends was expressing his displeasure at the hordes of \"beggars\" who are constantly asking for money on our city streets.  His issue was not that he is constantly being harassed but that they invariably follow a handout or a refusal with some disingenuous crap designed to solicit guilt or additional sympathy.  They bless you, wish you well, or indicate that your dollar has saved their family, at least for a few minutes - although $2 or $20 would have been better.\n\nMy friend said that just once he would like to hear an honest response.  Serendipitously the next guy let loose a string of insults and invectives that would make a hardened criminal blush.  He actually followed us down the street to make sure that my friend felt the full weight and force of his displeasure.  Not surprisingly my friend was fairly annoyed, although I did mention the universe had aligned to fulfill his request.",
