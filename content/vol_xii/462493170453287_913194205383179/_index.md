   "message": "Fuck, guess what ?? .....we receive letters too :/\n\n2015-12-10 15:01\nJames Nicoll\nYou don't have to add me as a friend, but would you be able to give me some advice on how to do things here in Quebec?\nI was in Ontario for 20 yrs and just recently moved back.  Most of the information is for the rest of Canada.  Quebec does things differently and any advice would be welcomed.  I was following Eternally aware for a couple years, but from other research I felt he was missing certain things.\nDanny Perez was helpful, but he advocates getting the Act of Birth instead of the Birth Certificate or Record of Live Birth.\nI've read some of Scott's stuff, but he isn't the most pleasant man to talk to.\nIf you can offer some help great, if not, can you recommend someone that can.\nI'm friends with Derek, but not sure how well he knows this stuff, since Scott looks down on him.\nThanks for your time.\n\n:/",
