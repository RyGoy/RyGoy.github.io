   "message": "If you are \"nice\" someone will think you are too nice.  Despite your best efforts, there is always someone who will find a way to take something you have said, as a heinous insult.  Almost no one is universally liked by everyone.\n\nI would rather deal with a thousand \"unpleasant\" people who are intelligent, literate educators than one pleasant person who knows little, but is really interested in my emotional well-being.   Scott used to be the nicest, most patient guy on the planet, but it's likely you (not necessarily you, you) wore him down with your stupid thoughts, pointless questions and comments, and demands for him to explain the same simple concepts again, and again, and again.\n\nSeriously, what do people want for free?  If someone is \"nice\", \"pleasant\", and concerned about your emotional health, they usually have an agenda, or are charging you money.",
