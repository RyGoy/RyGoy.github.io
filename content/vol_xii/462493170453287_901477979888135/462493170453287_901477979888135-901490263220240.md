   "message": "That man can see WAY farther than me. My limit is 5 years. All my life, I have tried. I can go no further. Give me enough ACCURATE data, on ANYTHING, and I can extrapolate it five years, with accuracy that surprises even ME.\n\n...but it ends there, and I don't know why. Gregory Perelman DOES know. I'm not qualified to understand any answer he would give me (yet), but you are correct, Janick;  Gregory Perelman and I share many parallel experiences.\n\nThat's what it is to be Illuminati. All we do is solve problems. It's what and who we are. it defines us. Everyone else is shitting on us when they are not trying to shower us with worthless trinkets they call \"AWARDS\".\n\nThere you have it. The big Scary Illuminati. See how we want to take over the fucking world?\n\nTHIS. This is what Piece-of-Shit Christians want you to be afraid of.",
