We were SECRET when we had to hide from Piece-of-Shit Christians.\n\nWe hide when we are among them for OBVIOUS reasons.\n\nKennedy was WORKING for the Banking system when he became President. He TRULY believed that he could \"fix the system from the inside\", and he was wrong. Just like everyone else who thinks \"fix the system from the inside\" is a valid concept. It isn't and those who believe it IS valid, always fail. There are no exceptions to this rule.\nIlluminati Rule #1 - Keep your Oaths/Promises",
