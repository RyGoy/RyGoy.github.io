   "message": "He was one of us. He intended to do EXACTLY what I'm doing now with this group, actually.\n\n...except he made OTHER promises. You don't get to do that, no matter how \"right\" you think you are. You don't break promises. It's that simple. If you want to be a \"rebel\", that's fine! I, myself ENCOURAGE it!\n\n...but above all, you KEEP YOUR PROMISES! If you have a promise to a banker, YOU KEEP IT. You KEEP IT AS IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT... because, make no mistake, it surely does.",
