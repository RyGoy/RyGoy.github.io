   "message": "WHY? We have to do it to stay alive. It's NOT GREAT. \n\nI'm in charge, and that's NOT a good thing either. It means THEIR accounting is in play. In 2016, I get to do EVERYTHING that they have done for the past 300 years.\n\nI'm best suited for the tasks that are coming. I've warned repeatedly, that your thanks and admiration of me is both a lie, and sorely misplaced.\n\nI will be signing execution orders for people's children, and I will be proud when I do it. If THEY did it, I GET TO DO IT.\n\nI was supposed to hold the post for 5 years... It will likely be longer, and I'm planning for it.\n\nYou didn't KNOW you were putting yourself in harm's way? \n\nREALLY? \n\nDo you not read what Pete is doing?\n\nWhat exactly did you think you were doing? Help me out here.",
