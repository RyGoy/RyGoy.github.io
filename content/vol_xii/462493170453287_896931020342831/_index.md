   "message": "Just catching up with a couple of threads here... So Scott is acting chairman of the Illuminati... A society established to fight the abuse of state power, superstition and religious control over the masses. \n\nI've a few of questions...\n\n1. Is it right to assume that the dis-information about the Illuminati that is out there is the work of the very people the society is trying to fight? I'll be honest, until I read the Wikipedia entry for the Illuminati, I was under the impression that they were the bad guys, the state power, the overpowering control behind governments... Now it would appear they are the opposite... My own ignorance is to blame on that one though...\n\n2. What was the purpose of the setup of The Tender for Law group to teach us to think right and thus gather worldwide agents for the building of a trustless banking network?\n\n3. Also, do you guys know who killed Kennedy? :p",
