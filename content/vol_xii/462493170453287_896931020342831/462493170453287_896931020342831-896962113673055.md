All we do is see if someone hurts/kills you, and if they DO, we capture that someone and ask pointed questions.\n\nIt's a simple mechanism that we've used for hundreds of years.\n\nYou don't get to un-learn this shit. Learning what I teach, is a ONE WAY trip. You expose yourself by merely doing THAT. People like you who ask what you do, AREN'T SUPPOSED TO EXIST anymore.\n\n...we simply leverage that negative for our personal benefit.",
