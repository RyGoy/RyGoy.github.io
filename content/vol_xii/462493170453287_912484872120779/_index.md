Do you you think liening the name would make trouble for me at the time of the mortgage renewal?\nI think I am \"shit out of luck\" at least until the Dogecoin gains some traction...\n\nPete Daoust\n19:58\nPete Daoust\nLOL.....why would you lien the name ?\n\nShane Pennell\n20:26\nShane Pennell\nHmm ... so I can stop being robbed of these debts.. \nMaybe I'm too chicken shit to challenge the debts without the ability back it up $$..\n\nPete Daoust\n21:02\nPete Daoust\nIdon't really understand where you are going with this.......sell these houses if they are not good for you :/",
