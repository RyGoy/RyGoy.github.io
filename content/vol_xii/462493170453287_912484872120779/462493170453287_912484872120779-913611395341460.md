I am not trying to get out of my mortgage, I am just trying to understand the \"lien your name\" concept better.\nWhat I was trying to understand is, if I liened the name, could I pick and choose who I inforced the lien with.\nWould I be able to inforce the lien against public debts and NOT inforce it against a mortgage.\nIt sounds like liening the name would not be an option for me at this point...\"\n\nYeah \"Shane,\" you should quit asking for legal advice to strangers on the Internet, and you should stop trying to find ways to commit fraud. Just sayin'.",
