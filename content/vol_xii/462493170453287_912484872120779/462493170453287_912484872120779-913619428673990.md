   "message": "OK, let me dumb this down for you.\n\nMy LEGAL name is LIENED. This means the SECURED PARTY has FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL to ANY CLAIM MADE ON THAT NAME. The REASON a bank won't give you a loan/mortgage, is because YOU ARE UNDER NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PAY IT BACK. The SECURED PARTY is the ONLY one you legally \"owe\".\n\nWould YOU \"loan\" money (By \"loan\" I mean CREATE DEBT AND OBLIGATION for which you are surety.) to someone who had NO legal obligation to pay it back?",
