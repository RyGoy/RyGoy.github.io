   "message": "DRAFT:\n\nHi, \n\nI am Chris and I am the man who has the legal entity named CHRISTOPHER EVAN SCHULTE with Registration Number xxxxxxxxx.  This is not my fault.  I have made a decision that I, as a man, no longer with to buy public debts.  To that effect, I have authorized a third party to secure a lien against all the value that I have contributed to the security that the Commonwealth holds (UCC xxxxxxxxxxxxx) and sent notice to the Secretary of State that I was resigning from any position to do with this registered organization that clearly belongs to you.  All of the business that happened prior to this resignation was without disclosure and under force.  \n\nMoving forward, I will authorize all the charges that come to me, presumably by mistake, to be paid by the surety, which I understand is you.  I will send each to you via registered mail and with a notarized copy of the surety bond.  \n\nIf you need me to do anything else to help you in the administration of the legal entity, with the exception of acting as surety for your property, please let me know what I can do for you.  \n\nSincerely, \nChris",
