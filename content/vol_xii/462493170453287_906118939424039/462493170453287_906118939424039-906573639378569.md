   "message": "I have been out since the weekend, and was just able to watch the Youtube link from Lou's article. I have very limited Internet access from my mobile phone. I can only see Facebook from my mobile phone (can't see youtube, :/ ), so I could read here something was happening somewhere, and now I realize reading the comments here, it was in the comments section from the video, which now appear as disabled.\n\nSo my apologies to you Scott, since I hadn't been able to watch the video until now. I wasn't able to follow what was going on. I just created a google account to comment, but comments have been disabled for the video.\n\nI do not know what was said (other than what has been posted here as quotes), but if comments were disabled, enough truth was said to counter the lies for Mr. Bates a.k.a. \"Law Society cocksucker Bates\" to disable comments.\n\nAgain my apologies to you Scott, I usually join a \"call to arms,\" I wasn't able to this time.",
