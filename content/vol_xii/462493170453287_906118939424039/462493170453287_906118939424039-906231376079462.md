Don't waste your time.\n\nPlay with him if you like but you will get no real answers. You will just get lies. I'm used to it. I've had a lifetime of people lying about me. It's what happens when \"kicked out of the club\".\n\nTara and I knew we were going to war with the Law Society in 2008. It's what started the whole \"Make new money\" movement. We weren't going to prove all that we say, only to have ask the deal-breaker question; \"OK, so how do we escape\"? There was no answer, but a LOT of frauds saying there was... so we made new money and showed you how to do the same.\n\nSee what a crushing blow Robert-Arthur: Menard, and Dean C. Clifford will suffer when asked about what we say happened? How will they hide their lies now?\n\nThe internet never forgets. :D\n\nDo feel free to ask him for more lies. We want LOTS of lies on record for 2016. We really do :D",
