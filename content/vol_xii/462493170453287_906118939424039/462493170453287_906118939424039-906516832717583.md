The ones who feel genuine anger at these people who indirectly mean them harm.\n\nTHEY are the ones who will be doing the container stuff!\n\nThen they skype me in, and I can do my awesome routine where I say \"If you live through this, you are to quit practicing law. Do you understand?\"\n\nThey answer...\n\nThen I say \"I'm just fucking with you. You're not going to live through this\". :D\n\nThat shit gets funnier every time :D",
