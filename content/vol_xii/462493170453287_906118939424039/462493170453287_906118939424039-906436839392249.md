   "message": "Wow. They are just making shit up about Scott Duncan!\n\n It seems to actually hurt their feelings that he has no victims. \n\nThese are the people calling him \"crazy\". Their lies are pointed out, and they either delete the comments or just pretend it didn't happen. \n\nThen they talk about \"Federal Lawsuits\"?\n\nAll of it seems to be because the resent him being honest, or something.\n\nIs this normal for you people?\n\nDoes the fact that Scott Duncan is the only one on the whole internet who tells the actual truth really upset you so much?\n\nAll of us reading are very confused by this and we'd appreciate any insight into this behavior, that any of you can offer.",
