   "message": "I never really give a shit when people lie about me, but I'm actually frightened of the people who are OK with it. Those kind are already predisposed to \"look the other way\".\n\nThat \"look the other way\" instinct you all nurture, on a daily basis, with your silence, is going to get me killed one day.\n\nLawyers make a living off your backs. These are people who LIE FOR A LIVING. They get paid for lying. This is a thing because you are all so OK with lying. You all expect \"somebody else\" to speak up, and when they don't, there's silence.\n\nThese people are literally claiming I'm \"selling\" \"legal theories\" and all of you are ok with that? That is a hugely damaging lie that ALL of you are ok with.\n\nNow you want me to point to a fucking book to help you?\n\nTHIS. This is why all your \"thanks\" are just empty words.",
