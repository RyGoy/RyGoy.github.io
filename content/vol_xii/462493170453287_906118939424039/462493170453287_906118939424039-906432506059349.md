   "message": "According to reports, I have \"victimized\" \"Camgirls\".\n\nTheir hard-hitting \"evidence\"? They point to the domain \"sapphosgirls.com\" (NOTHING to do with me) and says because I own the domain \"sapphogirls.com\" that it MUST be me.\n\nNo really! I'm not exaggerating or embellishing in ANY WAY whatsoever, as hard as that is for a rational mind to grasp.\n\nIs this sort of thing NORMAL for your kind?\n\nThey really think that this bullshit they literally make up on the fly makes me the \"bad guy'?\n\nSomebody explain this behavior to me, please!\n\nAre a lot of you like this?",
