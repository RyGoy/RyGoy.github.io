   "message": "Yes, I ordered live fire on boats bound for Cyprus. Many Muslim invaders are enjoying their 72 virgins in a watery grave. I'm glad I did it, and I'll do it again!\n\n...sounds really evil and bad, huh?\n\nNow some facts:\n\n1: UNESCO has patrol craft 100 km off the coast of Syria. Not only do they stop and warn that they will be fired upon if they approach Cyprus, but they OFFER TO TOW THEM AROUND CYPRUS!\n\n2: UNESCO in a serious breach of international law, RADIOED TYSON DIRECTLY to inform them of the course and heading of boats that refuse.\n\n3: THERE ARE NO WOMEN AND CHILDREN ON THESE BOATS. NOT EVEN ONE! ALL MALES AGED 14-40. \n\n4: AQUILAE TYSON is an old whaling vessel with a, now functional, harpoon gun. These boats blow apart into toothpicks where the bolt hits. AK-47s tend to come out the other side. \n\nThere is an attempt to INVADE Cyprus, that nobody's talking about.",
