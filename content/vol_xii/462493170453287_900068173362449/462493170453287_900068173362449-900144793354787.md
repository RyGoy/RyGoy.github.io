   "message": "I watched that judge bows video.  the judge only gives two options agent or representative. If he would have accepted agent, that would have made them surety right? or would it subject him to all the rules as an agent that he must follow?  How can they restrict his capacity to those two things? or perhaps he was just an agent for the name and not an agent of their agency?.. Trying to get this agent and agency straight in my little brain..",
