   "message": "I suppose. I REALLY doubt anyone has addressed you as Taxpayer Christopher. That is a title you must claim. You will notice that for 20 years after the \"new Deal\" movies often had \"I'm a TAXPAYER (Title) and I DEMAND (Look up the legal definition of DEMAND) MY RIGHTS\". Pure propaganda. The police were TRAINED to RESPOND to TAXPAYER'S demands. IF YOU can LEGALLY DEMAND, then YOU HAVE AUTHORITY. If YOU have AUTHORITY, then you also have SURETY.",
