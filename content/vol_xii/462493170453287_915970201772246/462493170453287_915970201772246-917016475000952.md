   "message": "The term \"Sovereign Citizen\" has been used only once during the event. And it's me who called them \"Sovereign Citizen\" because none of these idiots could give me a clear answer on \"FOR WHICH SOVEREIGN YOU GUYS ARE WORKING FOR ?\n\nOn the top of their document it is written in bold letters: UNDER THE NAME OF THE SOVEREIGN.\n\nSo, it's clear that everything they do, they do it UNDER THE NAME OF A SOVEREIGN........but they don't know its name :/\n\nSo I asked them: Are you these Sovereign Citizens the TV keeps talking about? :P\n\nCapture from camera 3",
