   "message": "FUCK! I didn't answer Landon's original question! Sorry about that :D\n\nLandon Christopher, the answer is NO, the \"SPECIAL SECURITY\" in the Bank Act s. 425/426 is NOT referring to the BIRTH CERTIFICATE.\n\nThe the context of 425 and 426, \"SPECIAL SECURITY\" is ONLY Real Estate/Real Property, (get ready for this) HYDROCARBONS (Yes that's what the act says!), and MINERALS.\n\nHYDROCARBONS AND MINERALS? That's what YOU are! ALL life is hydrocarbons and minerals!\n\nSo, YES the SPECIAL SECURITY refers to YOU, but the Birth Certificate is not it.\n\nONCE AGAIN! (FUCKING PAY ATTENTION THIS TIME YOU FUCKING IDIOTS!)\n\nTHE BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS CERTIFICATION THAT ON A SPECIFIC DATE, A CROWN ORGANIZATION WAS, IN LEGAL FACT, ORGANIZED!\n\nTHE BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS CERTIFICATION THAT ON A SPECIFIC DATE, A CROWN ORGANIZATION WAS, IN LEGAL FACT, ORGANIZED!\n\nTHE BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS CERTIFICATION THAT ON A SPECIFIC DATE, A CROWN ORGANIZATION WAS, IN LEGAL FACT, ORGANIZED!\n\nThis means it CANNOT BE anything else.",
