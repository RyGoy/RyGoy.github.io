   "message": "Here,s how it went, EXACTLY how it went.......I think it's worth to share it :D\n\nMe and Nad were sitting outside the court room, waiting.\n\nThis stranger (crown attorney) came to us, looked at Nad and said, Are you NAD ?\n\nNad said yes.\n\nThe strager said, can I talk to you in private ?\n\nNad said yes, she got up and this stranger wants her to go in that little room with him.\n\nSo, of course I got up and entered that room with Nad.\n\nStranger: I want to talk to her in private, can you get out please ?\n\nMe: no, I am staying here, she is MY wife (I should have said \"she is mine\", but whatever...)\n\nStranger: You have to get out.\n\nMe: I have all the good reasons to believe that I have the RIGHT to stay.\n\nMe: Do I have the right to stay?\n\nStranger: NO\n\nMe: I looked at Nad and said: REMEMBER HE SAID THAT.\n\nNad: Ok, I will\n\nSo I got up, and while I was going to get out, that stranger said: Ok, you can stay in :D\n\nMe: So you just lied, right? I HAVE THE RIGHT TO STAY?\n\nStranger: Nad, we won't need you here today, you can leave if you want, I have no idea why you've been asked to come here today :D\n\nI KNOW for a fact, that if I wouldn't go in there with Nad, this stranger would have take ADVANTAGE of her, he would had lied to her, and PROFIT from her..... :P",
