   "message": "�We are still reviewing the decision and considering our options,� said his lawyer, Peter Thorning... What the fuck does that even MEAN?\n\n...THIS GROUP is directly responsible for this decision. Can you imagine what would happen if there was public shit I could just point to?\n\nThey walk on eggshells regarding this group already! Deleting/banning the group at THIS point would trigger the \"Streisand Effect\" (look that up if you don't know what it is). This would get too many people asking questions.\n\nAs I am constantly reminding you, because there is still no adequate answer posted, yet; I'M THE ONLY ONE ON THE WHOLE FUCKING INTERNET WHO TELLS THE TRUTH ABOUT LAW! THE ONLY ONE!\n\n...why is that a thing? You think the Law Society hasn't noticed? REALLY? The last thing they want is people ENDORSING me as TELLING THE TRUTH. It would be the end of them.\n\nI also make NO secret of the fact that I have global communications network and can build/host a network the size of Facebook, on a whim. I'm doing this ON FACEBOOK. Not on the nx2000 network, not on the CDD, Not on ANYTHING I have direct control over. EVERYONE KNOWS that I have this ability. I won't shut up about it, and I REALLY like showing off how much I know, and how much I can do :D\n\n...NOBODY wants to see what happens when this group gets deleted...and LOTS of people have REALLY TRIED.\n\nLawyers are discouraged from reading THE TENDER FOR LAW, lest they start asking the wrong questions. \n\nLOTS of lawyers will say I'm \"wrong\" but when you start asking the obvious questions, they will either:\n\n1: Say you are too ignorant to understand (effectively nullifying any surety on your part. This may be a problem for them later, but lawyers are only taught to solve the problem in front of them, and avoid the \"bigger picture\".)\n\n2: Give a long convoluted legalese bullshit line, and claim YOU are \"mistaken\", because...grammar.",
