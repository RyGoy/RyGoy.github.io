It really is heart warming:\n\"Scott Duncan They REALLY think that's the best way to \"handle\" me.\n\nIf there IS a Law Society of Upper Canada member reading this... or if there's an Attorney General agent/officer reading, then perhaps you can pass on the message to your leash-holders:\n\nMy DIRECT and VERY PUBLIC assault on the LAW SOCIETY will begin with a story. When I publish the article titled:\n\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE: His name was Harrison Krupnik.\n\nWhen you see that published, it is strongly recommended that you get your affairs in order, because your masters are going to be upset, and in damage-control mode. You will become expendable, and your masters will throw you under the bus. You won't even have the option of switching sides! You are not welcome on the \"other side\", and there is a standing kill order for ANY Law Society member who dares set foot on an AQUILAE vessel. (I didn't even make the order! That was Admiral Wentz who did that!)\n\nAs always: I'll rip your lives apart, and I'll do it LEGALLY and LAWFULLY. wink emoticon\"",
