   "message": "Most are forbidden to even read what I write, or to mention my name... ever. It really is that sweeping. I'm told 4th year Osgoode students get some sort of written \"warning\" about me too. They are not very subtle about the intent of the notices, either. They \"Warn\" that bad things will happen to them (not specified) if they think mentioning me in ANY context is a good idea.\n\nFor me. Against me. Good things about me. Bad things about me...IT DOESN'T MATTER! If you are in the Law society, you are NOT to mention my name in the course of your duties. Ever. Not even a little bit.\n\n...but that's just \"crazy\" talk :D ...like that crazy computer money I've been going on about for 7 years. Pay me no mind.  :D",
