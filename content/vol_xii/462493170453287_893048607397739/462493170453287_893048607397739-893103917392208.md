   "message": "I do it on shit that I DO NOT CONTROL. I make it VERY clear that I can, on a whim, reproduce this on something I DO control...\n\n..with no pesky \"terms of service\", or even LAWS, for that matter, getting in the way. This is a fact... here. Now. IN REALITY.\n\n...and there's the distinction. To build THE TENDER FOR LAW on MY OWN infrastructure, would oppose a key message/method I'm trying to drill into your empty heads.\n\nHaving that kind of control over something that is not for me, but serves my agenda is NOT in my interests, and it could be argued it is an overtly hostile act...\n\n...but if I do it in RESPONSE to a hostile act, like say... deleting THE TENDER FOR LAW, then THEY have surety. That's all you people REALLY want. You want someone to assume surety for these rules. With SURETY comes AUTHORITY. NEVER lose sight of that. At the moment, Stephen Harper has SURETY for the PARTY he leads. It's why \"GOVERNMENT OF CANADA\" became \"HARPER GOVERNMENT\" [http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/a-rebranding-of-the-harper-government-1.1040716] and there is NOTHING you can do about it. EVERYONE who is given power, eventually USES it to their own gain. There are NO exceptions to this rule. NONE.\n\nIF YOU GIVE ME AUTHORITY, I WILL FUCKING USE IT! <--Best you DON'T FORGET THAT!",
