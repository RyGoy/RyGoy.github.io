   "message": "And now we revisit this scam-in-plain sight with JUSTICES/JUDGES. Dan Lien-your-Name Wilson drew attention to this, when he graciously showed all of you that the COURTS OF JUSTICE ACT only mentions \"judges\", and that a \"JUSTICE\" is NOT A JUDGE. GO CHECK! They are NOT THE SAME THING! ONTARIO HAS NO JUDGES. NONE! NOT EVEN ONE!\n\nThe Toronto Star has NO liability when they use \"Judge/Judges\" instead of \"Justice\". They are ORDERED to by the Law society. The ONLY time they use the title \"Justice\" is when they are referring to a specific individual.\n\nThink long and hard about that. THIS is done ON PURPOSE.",
