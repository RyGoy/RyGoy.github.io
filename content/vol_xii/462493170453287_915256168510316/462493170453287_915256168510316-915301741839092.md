   "message": "If I lead you to believe that I did not know the POLICE STATE is already here then please forgive me :D I also see how my original comment contradicts my more detailed explanation. \n\nNo...the majority does NOT acknoweledge it. When the mindless masses say they \"have nothing to hide\" I understand this to be the equivalent of saying that these policy imposing goons are \"just doing their job\". The majority thinks wrong and values the wrongs things. They believe in \"good cops\" that are there to \"serve and protect\" them. How can they ackowledge it with this sort of thinking? :/",
