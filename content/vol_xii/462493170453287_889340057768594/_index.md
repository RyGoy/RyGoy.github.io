   "message": "Can we take this from the top?\n\nThe person I happen to have received a SUMMONS today for a citation.  Incidentally, the vehicles involved are property of SGMI....no matter.\n\nCan we go through this slowly?  As you recall, I fucked it up (or maybe not, maybe they are this corrupt) last time. There are 3 charges\n\nStep 1, deposit 3 Birth Certificates into the Court File.\n\nStep 2, Notify all parties involved of the mistake in surety.\n\nOther interesting fact...this citation was issued on July 20, it didn't come into the persons mailbox until Aug 7, and was immediately Refused for Cause and returned to the court that the instructions said to send it to.  The citation has not posted to the Drivers License account still.",
