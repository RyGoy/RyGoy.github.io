   "message": "I have a legal axiom. It is my person's right to remain silent, because I can reasonably believe that any interaction with some \"authority\" it's to commit a crime against my person! Yes, that is a fact! \n\nSo, if \"anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law\", the name, or any other information, is part of that. I know giving a name can ONLY be used to HURT ME, and my persons! So why would ANYONE give any information? \n\nThat's my axiom. All burden of proof it's in the accuser. Let HIM prove/fabricate EVERYTHING!",
