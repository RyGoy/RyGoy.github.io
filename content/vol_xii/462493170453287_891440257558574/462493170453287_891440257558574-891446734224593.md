   "message": "Make sure that there is a dedication to the Ontario Government, and the Government of Canada for making teh book possible! If they had not fucked me over, you'd still be listening to free-dumbers, instead of getting ACTUAL answers.\n\nI WANTED to do it in 2009, but people were still clueless about Bitcoin, and thought it was \"stupid\" (Seriously! it wasn't until early 2011 that people stopped calling it \"stupid\".)\n\nThe government is WHY you even know I exist. If they hadn't screwed me over for services rendered, you'd never have known the name Scott Duncan in the context of your knowledge of law and money. \n\nMaking NEW money is literally an ACT OF WAR; Ask Muammar Gaddafi. He gave 60 Days Notice for the release of the Gold Dinar. He was dead shortly after. The IMF (US as agent) bombed the crap out of this new money source.\n\n An act of war was committed on January 3, 2009, when Bitcoin was created. There was 60 days notice (Nov 1 2011) but the IMF had nobody to bomb :D Now they're fucked. :D\n\nLet EVERYONE know why you know what you do. Let them know that you would not have been able to write what you do, if the government hadn't screwed me over. :D",
