   "message": "I guess I never could face these things or was so beatem and bullied that I never figured I could ever make a difference.   I honestly never thought about it.  I had always seen my mom lose her struggle and turned to drugs and alcohol rather than face the fact of this reality.   No one ever tried or put in the effort to correct my shit behaviour thought processes or value systems.  Mostly because everyone I've ever known had the same shit systems in place.   Fuck those are lots of excuses.",
