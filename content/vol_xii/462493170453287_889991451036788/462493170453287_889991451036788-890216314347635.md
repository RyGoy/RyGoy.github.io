   "message": "The Free-dumbers tell the truth too, don't forget!\n\nMenard lied through ommission for YEARS, before I stopped that. EVERYTHING Menard said was true... it's just the parts he leaves out that I had the problem with...\n\n...so I fixed it, and Menard can't scam anyone without me showing up and shitting on his fraud action. He counters with the \"Peanut-Butter\" theory :D\n\nStill, the point is, that the free-dumbers tell as MUCH TRUTH as they know and can squeeze in. They just need to leave room for their bullshit. :D",
