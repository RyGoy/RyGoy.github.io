Only a lawyer can.\n\nStuart Stone So the lawyer declares it & the doctor/psychiatrist provides opinion/evidence?\n\nHow does one counter this?\n\nScott Duncan Doctor ENDORSES. \n\nIt's ALL Surety and ACCOUNTING.\n\nStuart Stone http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/endorsement\n\nAn endorsement on a negotiable instrument, such as a check or a promissory note, has the effect of transferring all the rights represented by the instrument to another individual. \n\nScott Duncan Get it?\n\nIT'S ALL SURETY AND ACCOUNTING.\n\nStuart Stone Hell yes!!\n\nScott Duncan That is the what the Law Society does not want you to know.\n\nLAW becomes VERY easy once you grasp this one simple thing...and that kind of renders lawyers useless!\n\nStuart Stone IN VOID WE TRUST makes a whole lot more sense now\n\nScott Duncan VOID and LIEN! That's ALL I've ever said!\n\nScott Duncan Now you get why.",
