   "message": "I have sent Hydro-Quebec a few bills of exchange now and they've responded with this \"nice\" letter and a Consent or Proxy Authorization Form relating to the 'Act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information (CQLR, chapter A-2.1)'. It appears this Act came into force the same year as the Charter (UK CANADA ACT 1982)\n\nI've skimmed through the Act and the word PERSON appears in various forms a whopping 474 times!  As well as 7 instances of the words NATURAL PERSON.\n\nHere's a few other things in the Act I found interesting:\n\n3.  [...] The courts within the meaning of the Courts of Justice Act (chapter T-16) are not public bodies.   \n\n1982, c. 30, s. 3; 1982, c. 62, s. 143; 1992, c. 21, s. 375.\n\n5. Municipal bodies include\n\n (3) a mixed enterprise company established under the Act respecting mixed enterprise companies in the municipal sector (chapter S-25.01) and a similar body established under a private Act, in particular the legal persons constituted under chapters 56, 61 and 69 of the statutes of 1994, chapter 84 of the statutes of 1995 and chapter 47 of the statutes of 2004.  (See chapter 56)\n\n54. In any document, information concerning a natural person which allows the person to be identified is personal information.\n\n1982, c. 30, s. 54; 2006, c. 22, s. 110.\n\n56. The name of a natural person is not personal information, except where it appears in conjunction with other information concerning him, or where the mere mention of his name would disclose personal information concerning him.\n\n1982, c. 30, s. 56; 2006, c. 22, s. 110.\n\n58. The sole fact that a signature is affixed at the bottom of a document does not make the information shown therein personal.\n\n1982, c. 30, s. 58; 2006, c. 22, s. 110\n\nI know they simply can't SEE the man, so to speak and that I don't want to claim NATURAL PERSONhood. I have re-read Persons for Idiots and Agency for Idiots yet I'm still not certain what they're games is here.  Is this just another attempt at getting joinder or something else?... Pete?",
