   "message": "Scott, as I look through the divorce papers, it appears to me there are four different things in these divorce papers. The fourth is an AFFIDAVIT FOR JUDGEMENT with me and ex-wife and signed by only me,  The third is ME and EX-WIFE stipulation and agreement, the first is me and ex-wife and has FAMILY COURT JUDGEMENT on it and requires a parenting plan contract marked exhibit A and is me vs. ex-wife,. I wish to end this or at the minimum, change some things in it to correct some things that have changed. I am stuck and REALLY do not want to get left behind in this group but I think wrong and can not make it work out In order to cut the tie here.",
