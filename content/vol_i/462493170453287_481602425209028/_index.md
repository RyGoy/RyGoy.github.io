   "message": "THE TENDER FOR LAW is an examination of what you need to know to fight Judicial corruption, by examining the stuff you are LIED TO about.\n\nThis forum is where you can ask all your questions, and we don't have to keep typing the same answers over and over.\n\nPost your question, we will do our best to answer. OFF TOPIC POSTS WILL BE PURGED. We want people to be able to use this as a central reference and a place to go for help, where people will take the time to do so.\n\nPost any questions on LAW, MONEY, CONTRACTS, and JURISDICTIONS and how they are connected.\n\nKeep it civil, even if Scott doesn't. (It's Scott after all. Seriously, it's better than paying him) Remember that Scott chooses his words carefully. LEARN WHAT THOSE WORDS MEAN.\n\n",
