   "message": "Why would YOU prove it?\n\nCRA: You owe us money. Pay up...the INCOME TAX ACT says so!\n\nYOU: INCOME TAX ACT? Never heard of it, and I didn't sign it. If the Government did, then I guess I DO owe tax...Best check first. You ARE a GOVERNMENT worker, after all. If you were an honest man/woman you'd never be working there!\n\nSo I need to see if it's true. What was the BILL number this ACT was heard under? and what year?\n\nCRA: I don't...\nIt;s a BILL, Like \"Bill C-130\" or the like. Year and bill number please. I'll be able to check for myself.\n\nCRA: ...what?\n\nYOU: I see. You're inept. I get it. Please send me to your manager.\n\nThey need to prove to YOU. Not the other way around. EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS REQUIRE EXTRAORDINARY EVIDENCE.\n\nTHEY are claiming you are obliged!",
