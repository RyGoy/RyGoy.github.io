   "message": "what confuses me is the section that orders me to pay is the judgment paper with the Phillip name and the child support paperwork that comes every month is the PHILLIP name. If I use the void stamp it appears that I would be voiding the divorce which leads me to still being married to the ex-wife. To fix this, void the marriage license?  Or a letter to rescind the signature for the whole court file? WHERE am I thinking wrong here?",
