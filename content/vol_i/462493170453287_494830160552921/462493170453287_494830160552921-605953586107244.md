I aint saying shit. ..freedom of speech my ass. ...I said NOTHING like what's been said here...but still got arrested. \nCareful Scott. ..I don't know who all can read this...or what snakes are in the grass. Rat bastards are abundant. Trust me i know.\nso yeah... I thought Scott was only smarter than me...esp on all...This.  But after reading this...he's the better man too. If that was me... I wouldn't be here helping others...I'd be dead or doing life 25.\n\nI go to court tomorrow to deal with these little cock suckers.  \n\nGreat posts and awesome threads and group. Really outside of this group...Facebook seven no purpose for me",
