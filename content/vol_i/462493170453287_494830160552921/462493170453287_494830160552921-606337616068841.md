   "message": "Like wow. ..they called me ... I said I'm acting on that names behalf...and started to tell them that I have received the crowns garbage. As soon as I said that the JP or whoever she was interrupted me. I cut her off with \"point of order\" ...she shut up. I asked her if she's read the crowns info to assess the validity of my statement. She started humming and gassing real quick and went to get up.  She said for me to deal with the matter...I repeated...This garbage....and went to seek a few more weeks to review and prep my notices and affidavits.  She refused to hear me and walked a\nOut. As she walked I asked if she's abandoning the case...no answer.  I said oh good we must be done this then and i dont need to return...cuz im here now...on time...to deal with these so called matyers. I was then asked to leave the court room. How can I be in \"attendance\" if I'm told to get out?",
