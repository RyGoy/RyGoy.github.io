   "message": "My condolences on your loss Scott, I have a daughter and I would've done the same thing. That's some hard core justice you dished out, fucking A+. \nFew of us have the guts.\nReminds me of a story I heard from a trusted knowledgeable source recently about some guy in Illinois who's unbelievably learned in all law. Apparently this guy was dragged into court for attempted murder. He flat out said in court - \"If I find that cocksucker, I'll kill him DEAD and there's nothing any of you can do about it.\"\nSupposedly, they let him go and did not take his guns. They did NOT wanna fuck with HIM. He'd filed some type of affidavit stating his truth and right to justice under the common law. It would be interesting to read this affidavit, if it exists.\nAnyway, my point here is, while there is always more to learn (which is why I keep coming back here in-spite of how annoying some people are); at the end of the day, what the fuck are you going TO DO with the knowledge youï¿½ve gained? Hold the rapists accountable or die on your fucking knees?",
