   "message": "We all have stories, Scott Duncans tragedy is one of many and each of us has cause to destroy these douche bags. The deception is so cruel and inhuman that we have little choice but to turn the tables. I'm not saying turn the page, I'm saying tear the fucking house down with the same hostility and ill will that has been brought to bear upon our backs and spirit. That lovely bible they have us swear on calls for hands and eyes. Let them know that their god is calling upon his persons to suffer and suffer they shall! Gunther von Hagens could do a classy throes of death pose or nifty amulets for a gallery we could build. I can see Peter \"humanitarian bombs\" Mackay plasticized in an auto fellatio pose while Kathleen Wynne eats his ass, casted for perpetuity,  publicly displayed in front of their playground (parliament)",
