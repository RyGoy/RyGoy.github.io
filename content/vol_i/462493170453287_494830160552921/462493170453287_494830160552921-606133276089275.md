   "message": "Tha Baztard: There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about going on a killing spree.\n\nMy dirty little fingers are in EVERYBODY's pie. Government Tenders are interesting things. They go for the LOWEST bidder, so the bidder must find a way to cut costs.\n\nI know what I'm doing, and money is NOT a motivator. I have worked for as low as $30.00 an hour to install MY shit with theirs.\n\nSuffice it to say, I could kill 10-20 people before they'd even know the killings were connected.\n\nSince everything is SO compartmentalized, and ALWAYS handled by third parties, they couldn't get coordinated enough to even figure out WHY they are connected.\n\nI could even add \"chaff\" to my killing spree. If the home addresses of every \"justice\" were published, how may killings by OTHER VICTIMS would happen?\n\nWhen I say I am going to collapse the banking system and start a war, I REALLY MEAN IT.",
