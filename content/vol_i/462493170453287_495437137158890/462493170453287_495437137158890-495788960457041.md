   "message": "Lawyers, be they attorneys or notaries, in Quebec are required to hold a degree in civil law. There are various names for the degree, depending on the university which grants it. McGill University and Universit� d'Ottawa grant a Bachelor of Civil Law degree, while other universities, such as Universit� Laval, grant a Bachelor of Laws degree (LL.B.). Candidates must then complete an articled clerkship, pass the professional bar course and be called to the Barreau du Qu�bec (Bar of Quebec) before being able to practise law.",
