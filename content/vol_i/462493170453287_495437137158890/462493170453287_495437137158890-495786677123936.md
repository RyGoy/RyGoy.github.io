   "message": "Civil Code of Quebec\n\nQuebec's current civil code, the Civil Code of Quebec,[9] was the product of a lengthy review of the civil law, beginning with the establishment of the Civil Code Revision Office in 1955. The new Civil Code of Quebec was enacted in 1991, and came into force in 1994. This Code repealed both the Civil Code of Lower Canada and the Civil Code of Quebec of 1980.\n\nThe current Code consists of ten books:\n1.Persons\n2.The Family\n3.Successions\n4.Property\n5.Obligations\n6.Prior Claims and Hypothecs\n7.Evidence\n8.Prescription\n9.Publication of Rights\n10.Private International Law",
