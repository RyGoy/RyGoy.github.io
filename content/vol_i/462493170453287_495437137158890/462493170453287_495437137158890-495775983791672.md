   "message": "Joseph Pierre Gilles, I believe that the judge is accurate in that you are a citizen.  I suspect you were in a court having only statutory jurisdiction and that the only two parties having standing in that statutory matter were the Crown and the fiction(taxpayer/citizen).  A Man cannot be recognized in a statutory court.  That is why any submissions you made had to be deemed as coming from one of the parties having standing in the matter.  And you clearly werent the Crown so the judge can only reasonably deduce that you must be the other named party - the taxpayer/citizen.",
