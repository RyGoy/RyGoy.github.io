   "message": "i was on the hook for 20g, I got my ducks together and proceeded with a statement of claim in the FEDERAL REGISTRY. I messed up my form and the Crown received a motion to dismiss my claim. No known cause of action. Interesting thing, in the judgement they recognized my claim of right, that I am an individual and self presented, the Crown won motion to strike but the judgement stated i clearly has issues with the government and if I could formulate a proper claim, I was free to do so.",
