   "message": "This a very brief r�sum� of what I�ve told the Judge in tax court that I spent the first 12 months on this case learning HOW to file and prepare a petition because I have no lawyer representing me.\nI told him, After I filed the petition, I started learning LAW and discovered some weird stuff, first, your honor, I have read the Quebec Income Tax Act, and its says in this act that EVERYTIME the act use the word act and/or law, it INCLUDE an act and/or law OTHER than an act and/or law of the Parliament of Quebec.\nSo the way I understand this your Honor is that this act/law address a certain group of people, and this group of people seems to be EMPLOYEE and/or AGENT of the Government of Quebec.\nSo, your Honor, I just want to make sure I had to go trough all this�..since I�M NOT an agent and/or Employee of the government, do I really have to be here your Honor�???\nThe Judge said: Well you have a very NICE petition here very well made, I would focus on that if I would be you.\nI said: Yes, I agree, but I came here to tell the thruth, and I don�t want to be a pain here, I just need to know if my discoveries are TRUE OR NOT�.is it right your HONOR that agent/employee of the government only have to submit to this act.???\nJudge said: EVERY CITIZENS have to obey the income tax act�.\nI said: I have no Idea whats a CITIZEN your HONOR\nJudge said: YOU ARE A CITIZEN\nI said: ok your HONOR, if you say I am a citizen its your choice, but I still have no idea of whats a CITIZEN is.\nSo I went on with my PETITION for a good 5 hours plus�.at the end, I said that I�ve told ALL THE TRUTH here and I don�t owe NOTHING to NO ONE, and I WONT PAY NOTHING to NO ONE\nThe judge said he believed me, and he said he will give his verdict in a few weeks�.",
