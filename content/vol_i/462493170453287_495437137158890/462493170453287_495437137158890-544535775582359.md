   "message": "Pierre, i did. The head of Revenue Services here for the City of Toronto is a MISTER Casey Brendon- and yes, i do refer to him as that in any NOTICE i have sent him. HE DOESNT KNOW. He wanted to pass me DOWN to someone in CUSTOMER SERVICES. I told him- \"...we're going backwards here. Pass me UP to the one person with the greatest knowledge of bills-of-exchange and negotiable instruments. Gave me to a lawyer with the City, MS. Christina Hueniken. She claimed not to know what i was talking about, either.",
