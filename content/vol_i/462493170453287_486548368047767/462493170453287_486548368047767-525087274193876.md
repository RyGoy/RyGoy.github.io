   "message": "Take a look at an old-paper-bill. On the front, on the shiny-strip that runs north-south on the left-hand-side, at the bottom if it, almost hiding-in-plain-sight because i never noticed it up until recently, is 'The Crown Seal'- the Lion and The Unicorn-image. The Crown Seal is NOWHERE to be found on our new plastc-polymer-bills. What about you Adam Thomas, are the new plastic-bills in Australia missing the same CROWN SEAL on it, too?",
