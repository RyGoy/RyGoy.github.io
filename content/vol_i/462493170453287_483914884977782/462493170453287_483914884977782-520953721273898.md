   "message": "Thank u all for your tips. Thanks Derek Moran, as for the automobile I don't care, the gov has the certificate of title of the vehicle, the gov has legal title to the vehicle which are fully liable at law as the legal owner. They cannot deny this as they will not insure the vehicle without that certificate which comes from the vehicle manufacturer. I only have the right of use as the beneficial owner. In the motor vehicle act under \"owner\" it does not clarify what type of owner and it states this: owner includes a person in possession of a motor vehicle under a contract which he or she MAY become its (legal) owner on full compliance with the con-tract.\" It's saying u MAY become liable as the legal title owner if u dont say other wise to the unlawful unilateral con-tract. Notice it also contradicts its meaning. The insurance corporation act literally states only the legal person can con-tract. Not my problem they misconstrued my autograph.",
