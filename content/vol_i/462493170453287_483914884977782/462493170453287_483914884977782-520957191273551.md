   "message": "In the past three hearings I have had the justice run from the court room from the first 30 seconds from the time i approach the front with the three lawyers. Haven't heard anything from any of them for over three months now. They have not attempted to reset any more hearing in the de facto Supreme Court. I always have 10 to 15 sheriffs escorting me like a king every where I go inside the court house. They even have the elevator open and waiting for me. I thanked them for being great public servants. :)",
