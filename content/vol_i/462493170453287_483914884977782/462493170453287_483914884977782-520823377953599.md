   "message": "How is trust law the \"highest law\"? Every filthy justice has never accepted me as the grantor, sole shareholder, sole equitable title owner, and sole living beneficiary to the NAME in trust. As evidenced in the civil code of Quebec articles 298,299,300 and 305 as jus common? I realize the purpose is to steal from my security/trust. How de we enforce this upon the pretend justice in a foreign de facto court?",
