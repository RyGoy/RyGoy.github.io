   "message": "Title was split to create a trust. The birth certificate is the receit for the security. You are the sole share holder of your person/corporation. No one can have an equitable claim upon your person as u r the sole share holder! Shareholders are not trustees of the person/corporation.i understand the notice of mistake without question. The notice of mistake originated from a maxim of law regarding the \"error\" in the NAME. I live in BC, interpretation act section 8. Every enactment applies to the whole of Canada. Common law is hidden within Quebec civil code, read the preamble. If we need to file a claim against another party, we cannot file the \"notice of mistake\"??? So besides propria persona and private capacity, one has no standing in court, yet equity is king, so how do we identify ourselves with standing without the NAME????",
