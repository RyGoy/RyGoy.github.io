You aren't that PERSON, even if, for some crazy reason you have been donating funds to the account for that PERSON, with that SIN for a number of years...and if you are not that PERSON, how can you possibly know firsthand, whether that PERSON was working for the government, or what that PERSON was earning...and how can you, the man, be held liable?...bedtime for me mate ;-)",
