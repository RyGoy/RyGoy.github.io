   "message": "Pierre Daoust, it may be worth running this possibility by Scott for his feedback, or at least to not appear as a rebel/combatant to the 'system' until you can get your head around the whole thing...  UDHR Article 6: Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law... If you have that right, then you can also waive that right & notify/demand to know by what authority you are to be recognised as the person/taxpayer that they are claiming you to be.  Then write telling them that you are more than willing to assist them with their inquiries, but of course you're not a lawyer or accountant & therefore not qualified to interpret the law/income tax code or any other statute.  Consequently, it is unreasonable for them to expect you to carry out work for them & be held liable for any errors you may have made in the past, and of course, you don't work for free.  (This is all paraphrasing Dean's de-taxing episode)  Set a fee schedule for work to be done at an hourly rate (equal pay for equal work suggests you should charge whatever a qualified tax accountant would charge), estimate your hours (you're not qualified, so it could take a looooot of hours to do the work) & you need to access all your previous income documents from storage (from all of your working life), so your estimate to carry out the work they want you to do is approx $40k.  Also demand a liability waiver for any errors or omissions because you're not a qualified lawyer or accountant etc...notice them that failure to receive an acceptance & up front payment within 21 days means that there is agreement between the parties that no contract exists between you the man & them, regarding the tax account (the SIN & NAME), fault & default them & swear out an affidavit attesting to the facts.  Come court time, you are the one with the facts & you can challenge your opponent to prove their claim that you are a person known as a taxpayer.....Ok Scott, tear me a new one ;-)",
