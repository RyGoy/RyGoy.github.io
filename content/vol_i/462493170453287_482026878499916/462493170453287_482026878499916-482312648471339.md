   "message": "Question:  Is it ever too late to correct the record that you're not to be recognised as the person, even though for the past however many years you have acted in that capacity and donated to the PIERRE DAOUST Trust fund???...Like Dean tells us, as it is done, so it is undone...correct the record as to who you are...and who you are not...and send Scott Duncan a promissory note for a few lapdancers so he throws you a bone on this thread mate ;-)  I have used the process I mentioned in the UK, although well before any proceedings were threatened.  HMCE (revenue service) called asking who I was, I told them that if they don't know, then how can they claim to have any business with me...haven't heard anything in over a year...at the very least, it has given me time to learn more ;-)",
