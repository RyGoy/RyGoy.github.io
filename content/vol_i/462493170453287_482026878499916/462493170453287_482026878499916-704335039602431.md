   "message": "Yeah you have to ask Parliament or, as they referred me to, Library and Archives Canada, i.e. the ones who wrote and store the law... They can't certify the \"current version\" because it is a compilation of the original enactment (1948?) plus any amendments since then. Each of those individually is certifiable, but the \"current version\" is not, because it was never enacted as a whole. You don't need registered mail - email, fax or regular mail works fine - it's their job to store and share (or sell) the laws.",
