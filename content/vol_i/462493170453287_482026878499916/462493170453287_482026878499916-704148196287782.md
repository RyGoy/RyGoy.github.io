   "message": "\"give me a certified copy of the income tax act from the queens printer\" -- You can't get this because the \"current version in force\" is not certifiable in its entirety.  The current version is a compilation of the original enactment, which could be 100 years ago, plus all the amendments since then.  Only the original and each individual amendment are \"officially\" signed, enacted and certifiable. That said, if you want a copy of the original Income Tax Act or amendments you can ask for them at http://www.parl.gc.ca/. They don't publish or enforce laws that aren't lawfully enacted... that's a myth. Anyone doing such a thing would be wide open to a claim for damages, and if it was common or permitted people would figure it out and the entire legal system would fail very quickly.",
