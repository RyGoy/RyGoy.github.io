   "message": "Started working I was 17, since that age, I filed income tax returns every year, some of these years, I paid a ridiculous high amount of $$ on income tax, but I didn�t know any better, and had the idea that I HAD NO OTHER CHOICES�.\n\nI�ve received a letter on Jan. 2010 from Agence du Revenu du QUEBEC, the letter daid: WE HAVE GOOD REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT YOU DON�T DECLARE ALL YOUR REVENUES�.so I called them to know what the heck was that, the guy on the phone told me to NOT WORRY, just filled the questionnaire we sent you and the DOSSIER will close in 2 to 3 weeks�\nSo guess what I�ve done..???...I FUKIN GAVE THEM EVERYTHING�.so according to statistic CANADA, they decided that it was impossible for me to live with 48k NET per year du to our situation. Situation is my wife does not work, we have 4 children so as per their calculation I have not declare some revenues.\nSo they�ve sent me a bill of 40k appx, and Canada did the same�appx 40k as well, but Canada is not involve for now in the case, they say they are waiting for QUEBEC results in this.\nWhen I received this request of 40k, I litteraly felt on my knees�..I felt trapped and even raped at this point, we were now around April 2011, so more than a year after their first contact�\nI started to look for SPECIALIST in this and found out very fast that these SPECIALIST was crooks�soI went in what they call OPPOSITION with them.\nAnd I also started to search the internet on some rights that I could have against these kind of LEGAL MAFIA�.\nIn November 2011 it was very dark in my head�.I started to think at very dark stuff�.I went to the hospital and they kept me for a week and gave me some pills�.so I did stuff after that and they�ve REJECTED MY OPPOSITION by March 2012, �then I had no choice to file a court request and again, GIVE EVERYTHING TO THE COURT and now QRA are the DEFENDANT on case no. 500-80-021468-120 in Cour du Quebec\nAs I was continuing to search the net to find some help, I felt on a guy named John James Harris on youtube�.WOW..!!!..and then Robert Menard..WOW!!!!...so I started read and re-read UDHR, the Canadian Bill of Rigths, The Canadian Charter, the Quebec Charter the Covenants and all that crap�.\nOne day, I think it was in July 2012, I�ve felt on Dean Clifford on youtube�..OMG�OMG�OMG�I knew.I had something there�.I�ve realized at about August 2012 that I was not THE NAME�.I think I�ve met Scott Duncan here in November or Maybe October 2012�..it did it again�OMG..OMG�OMG�.and that has nothing to do with Scott social skills or Scott sex appeal�.I guess I was enough open minded to shut up and learn, because Scott addresses on me these first talks was not very lovely�.But he was right and true�.anyway\nDec.4th 2012 I had a meeting in court for my case, and I sent a TELEGRAM to the judge and the QRA lawyers a few days before�.I asked the judge to rebut his oath of confidentiality to be able to tell the truth about the fact that there is no LAW in Quebec about income tax, and blablablabla�.\nThey received the TELEGRAM at 9:10:07am Friday Nov. the 30th 2012,�.10 minutes after I received a call from the lawyer saying that she could not be there on the 4th, cause she had something else to do�..\nI received last week a date for next court appearance which is March the 21st 2013.\nJanuary the 3rd 2013, I sent a notice to the QRA Lawyer asking for some missing information on MY NAME�.I asked: \nI told them I figured out that this Income Tax Act apply to employee of the government ONLY, and I was curious to know since when I hold this position of a taxpayer with them, I also asked for Date of Hiering, a COMPLETE statement account on the PERSON, proof of remuneration, Where was my office exactly and a few other question like that�.I told them I owe DUE DILLIGENCE enough to my PERSON to make sure, I�m not being robbed, or being fraud, or being kept in slavery�.\n\nTheir reponse was: Dear Mr. Daoust, these has nothing to do with the CASE in question�.???????????????????....\n\nSo I�ve sent the same Notice to the FIRST guy who caontacted me on January the 6th 2010�no answer from him so far�\n\nI�m sure I�m doing half of the thing in the wrong way, but I�m doing instead of trying to figure out how to shoot myself�.\n\nNow, I�m ready to go in court to file all these letters I�ve sent and ask the court that BEFORE WE CAN GO ON�.I NEED THESE ANSWERS FROM THEM SO March the 21st seems to be not a good date�.postpon the date please to whatever the date I will receive all the information I need from them part to be able to proceed�\n\nI look weird when I enter the Quebec Court�.I know fakal�.lol�\n\nHopefully this THREAD will have a few answers for me�I shorted the story as much as I could �sorry for the punctuation, accent and length�.",
