   "message": "The SIN is your government employee number if that is what you are asking. With the government acting as an employment agency when you use it on an employment application, which serves as a recognition that the government is a party to your employment, and therefore any \"taxes\" levied are \"their cut\" for the privilege of being employed or the agency fee for making the employment available to you, and since most corporate charters come into existence through and with the government you are acting as an agent under that SIN number. Insofar as I understand it to date, all subject to correction upon further review and correction by Scott Duncan if he would be so kind.",
