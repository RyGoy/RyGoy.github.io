   "message": "Adam Thomas: Hahaha. I rember my conversation with Arthur Christian & he was going through a long list of people he believed to be agent provocateur's & plants. He claimed that Robert Menard & Dean Clifford are agents. I dont BELIEVE they are. Deano is being taught a harsh lesson from a pack of kunts that hate him & others for EDUCATING PEOPLE WITH THE TRUTH. Arthur BELIEVES that if ye cant see it or you haven't seen it then HOW DO YE KNOW ITS REAL OR HAS HAPPENED.He also questioned if we actually revolve around the sun & I answered \"yes we do.\" His reply was \"BUT HOW DO YE KNOW THAT?\".......SIGH...HO HUM..FUCK ME....",
