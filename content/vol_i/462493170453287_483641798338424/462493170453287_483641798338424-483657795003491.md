   "message": "Chairs Forward...second paragraph!\n\n .Canada has been a member of the Organization of American States since January of 1990. We have developed strong relationships with the Americas and we have been active in promoting human rights issues in the region. However, Canada has not yet ratified the principal treaty with respect to the protection of human rights in the Americas: the American Convention on Human Rights.
