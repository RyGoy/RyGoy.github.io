   "message": "Speaking as someone whose parents pulled her out of the public school system after grade 1 and both my younger brother and I were homeschooled from then on out, I can tell you from experience that they CANNOT stop you. And the homeschool curriculum we used was 4 or 5 grades AHEAD of what the public education system teaches. The easiest option is that...forget fighting the school board...pull her out and find a local homeschool group to join. When I finally chose to go to high school in grade 9 for the art classes, not only did they accept all of my previous credits, they gave me credit for the other high school classes I was simultaneously doing at home. Better education in the end, and no messy legal battles.",
