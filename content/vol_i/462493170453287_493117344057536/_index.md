   "message": "So Scott, in a case of a daughter not being interested awfully much at school (just starting highschool). The School Board had a \"hearing\" and announce that \"daughter\" MUST ATTEND and PARENT MUST MAKE SURE, otherwise they THREATEN said parent to confinement and/or $1000 fine in Queens Bench court. So now there's an \"order\" for this to happen.\n\nAlready put together a Notice of Mistake on her behalf. Wondering what can be added to a NOTICE, as in can you add items to a notice, (as per attached).\n\nThey are threatening ME. Does this need to be included in the notice? Is there not lawful regard to threatening anyone?",
