   "message": "Becoming a surety for someone accused of a crime is a lovely way to voluntarily enter into bonded servitude.  You consent to the jurisdiction, yourself, having committed no crime, and agree to provide valuable assets, guarantees and unpaid babysitting for the new �ward of the court�.\n\nWhile it may be tempting to get mom out of jail, after she allegedly robbed the jewelery store and all,  you are guaranteeing the �accused� complies with all conditions imposed by the court (to secure their temporary liberty), and accepting full financial responsibility for any action, or inaction, deemed as a default of those undertakings.  It's a little like that advertisement for �bits and bites�.  You never know what the conditions are going to be when you consent to the process.\n\nIf things don't go well, be prepared to say farewell to some, or all, of your assets.",
