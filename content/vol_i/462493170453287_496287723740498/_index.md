   "message": "So Scott, I am observing that putting a lien on some/thing/person would exclude becoming a \"plaintiff\", rather it is a claim of right? And we do not want to be a \"plaintiff\". Therefore, for some/thing/person must become the \"plaintiff\" in order to get said lien removed.\n\nOn that note, is there not a procedure with liens? A notice, failure notice, etc. that must happen? How did you lien the warrant so quickly in Dean's case?",
