   "message": "Maybe just focus on public trusts vs private trusts.\n\nIf it's a private trust, it's nobody's business except that of the grantor/trustee(s)/beneficiary(ies).  Anyone else is not a party and it is literally none of their business.\n\nThe only public notice then becomes: The property/person (described by these features), has been liened into a private trust.\n\nThis is why ANY questions from any of us about the AQUILAE TRUST are met with 'None of your fucking business', not because Scott Duncan is being a dick about it, but literally because unless we are a party to it, it's none of our business...and it serves as a gentle reminder from him on how to deal with interlopers (policy enforcers etc)  who try to meddle in our private affairs ;-)",
