   "message": "Funny, I just finished reading this publication this morning. It can also be found here in its original format - http://www.mind-trek.com/practicl/comliens.htm - Can't help but wonder how the process applies to putting liens on the OWNER of a corporation and all HIS assets, chattels and real property? Is it possible to \"suffocate\" a debtor with the lien process into compliance? More research on the way... Btw, all input from resident \"silver bullets\" is much APPRECIATED! :)",
