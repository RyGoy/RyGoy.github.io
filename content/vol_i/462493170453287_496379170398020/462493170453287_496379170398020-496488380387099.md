   "message": "You've been CHARGED with something? Interesting, because i was under the impression that you are charged with offences under the Criminal Code, which is an ACT, comprised of STATUTES. As i understand it, the STATUTES in that ACT, only apply to \"every one\" \"person\" or \"owner;\" and the definition for all those is either a HER MAJESTY, or, an ORGANIZATION. You should ask them- \"I dont wanna accuse anyone of MISREPRESENTATION, because Misrepresentation is FRAUD. But could you please tell me, which one am i- HER MAJESTY, or an ORGANIZATION?\"  :/",
