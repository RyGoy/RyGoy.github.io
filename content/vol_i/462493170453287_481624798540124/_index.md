   "message": "YOU ARE THE \"NATION\"\n\nIt is always a temptation to an armed and agile nation\n  To call upon a neighbour and to say: --\n\"We invaded you last night--we are quite prepared to fight,\n  Unless you pay us cash to go away.\"\n\nAnd that is called asking for Dane-geld,\n  And the people who ask it explain\nThat you've only to pay 'em the Dane-geld\n  And then  you'll get rid of the Dane!\n\nIt is always a temptation for a rich and lazy nation,\n  To puff and look important and to say: --\n\"Though we know we should defeat you, we have not the time to meet you.\n  We will therefore pay you cash to go away.\"\n\nAnd that is called paying the Dane-geld;\n  But we've  proved it again and  again,\nThat if once you have paid him the Dane-geld\n  You never get rid of the Dane.\n\nIt is wrong to put temptation in the path of any nation,\n  For fear they should succumb and go astray;\nSo when you are requested to pay up or be molested,\n  You will find it better policy to say: --\n\n\"We never pay any-one Dane-geld,\n  No matter how trifling the cost;\nFor the end of that game is oppression and shame,\n  And the nation that pays it is lost!\"\n\nNEVER PAY THE DANE-GELD!",
