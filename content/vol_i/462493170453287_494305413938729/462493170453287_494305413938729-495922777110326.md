   "message": "thats why scott says create a trust heald by a corporation (person) and claim by a lien ownership & control of the birth certificate. in the case of a warrant issued, the party has to claim the birth certificate as his property to control. as if it were stolen, the lien is proof it's your property that they have to return to the rightful owner. and i believe this leaves them with no evidence.",
