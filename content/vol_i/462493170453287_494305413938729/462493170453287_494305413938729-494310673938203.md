   "message": "<<[59] It is how we behave, above all, that determines the success or failure to represent the law.  The arrogant, the aggressive the vengeful litigant injures the law as much as the corrupt official.  The weak, the frightened, the ignorant litigant injures the law and their own character by doubting themselves and failing to work on their competence and knowledge.\n\n[60] Despite the labels of pirates and privateers- forgive those who act in such a manner. Rise above the hatred, the cruelty. Be a beacon of honesty, respect and honor so that such character shines like a blinding light against judicial corruption.  Never forget that your are immortal and how we live (and die) in one life can affect many lifetimes of lessons.>>",
