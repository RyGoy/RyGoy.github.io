   "message": "If the Government IS a Trust; why cant i just say- \"YOU GUYS take care of this Trust-shit for me. Except, we're gonna be doing things a little bit differently around here. I will be the EXECUTOR calling the shots, and especially I will be the Beneficiary NOW..and you guys will start being what you were intended to be all along, the TRUSTEE now for a change. And considering how much this \"valuable instrument/security\" is supposed to be worth, i will have NO PROBLEM with paying you guys you're administrative-fee for doing your job in the form of INCOME TAXES from the value/credit derived from the Trust-account you guys set-up but NEVER had any intention of telling me about until i BROUGHT IT UP, thank you very much!!\"  :)",
