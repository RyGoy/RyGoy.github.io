   "message": "Sigh..... I am a big fan of ALL of this...and I've been following all that's been said.\nBut.....at one point I realized that Scott's not joking when he insults peoples intelligence. Some here....are NOT suppose....just trying to wrap their brains around so many ideas that go against the grain....\nSo.....Im a Freeman yes.......but not everyone is buying into this. Me...because of ...pompous comments.... I'm gonna play the little goat...and go get the big goat...who hasn't bought into \"this\"...\nAnd have him read ALL this (he doesn't use Facebook)...and have him dissect everything that is being said here. The good news is...that he might see our side...the bad news....he's smarter than anyone here hands down, and just might make mincemeat out of everything Scott...or anyone of us....has to say.\nAnd then I'll have him tell everyone how stupid they are for not keeping up...\n\nI was told by  Dean Kory that this was the spot for intellectual exercise....not a diatribe from some dude who thinks he's holier than thou. I ain't been here long.....and I DO like many posts made...but...nah.... I don't need some know-it-all who thinks he's smarter than everyone \"educate\" the ignorant by insulting them.\nNot cool.\nSo...after My big brain big gun tears a few new assholes... I'm out. Lots if GREAT info....but I don't like the tone and don't need someone who in all likelihood can't hold a flame to ME in the real world....act like he's God and insult people who are simply.on the path of Truth and Enlightenment",
