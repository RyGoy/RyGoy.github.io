   "message": "I was called a troll because I was trying to tell people they dont understand UCC in the GLOBALFACT forum. Maybe you could go have a look at what I said in there? Tony has suggested a conference call and has asked me to be a part of the OPPT discussion. I use the information you have presented here. I paraphrased your definition of courtesy - that didn't go over well with the believers. Basically my stand is DON'T get involved with UCC because you don't understand it. If you think OPPT is great - GREAT sit back and watch the show and reap any benefits from it.",
