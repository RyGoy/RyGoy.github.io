   "message": "I just don't want anyone to get fucked over Scott. People are not stupid by choice - usually. I was invited by Tony to be a part of a small panel discussion about it. I am not sure why. I am very simple. The lady called Tami Pepperman warned people that sending in even the Courtesy Notice from OPPT will \"attach\" (word maybe wrong I know) to UCC. That is all I want to say. BEWARE - Sit back and enjoy benefit - but don't fall into the OPPT honey pot trap.",
