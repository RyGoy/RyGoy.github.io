   "message": "My bad. Right the proxy. If I reclaimed it myself I would be confessing into their jurisdiction. I figured I would put the bond into a trust as settlor provided I can find someone I can trust and make myself beneficiary. Then open a non-interest bearing trust account at a bank and the trustee would get the check book. I may have some more work to do yet. What do you think. I am going to slam that asshole captain tonight.",
