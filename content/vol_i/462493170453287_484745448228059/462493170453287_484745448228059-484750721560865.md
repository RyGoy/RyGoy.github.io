OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL, and it's NOT like it's a state secret how I feel on any issue they may have.\n\n...their position isn't a big secret either. I make fun of it constantly. They value BELIEF. I don't. They say I must \"respect\" belief, I say it should be destroyed.\n\nNobody's confused.\n\nWHICH IS WHY I DON'T GO INTO CHURCHES TRYING TO DESTROY THEIR DELUSIONS! IT'S THEIR FORUM. NOT MINE.\n\nIT\"S NOT MY RIGHT TO IMPOSE IN FORUMS I DO NOT CONTROL/ADMINISTER\n\n...if you were INVITED, then that's different. ;)",
