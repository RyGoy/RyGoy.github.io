   "message": "What annoys me the most is his lack of honesty......but there are many that lack this very basic & grounding value. \nShit-for-brains named Duhrick,  are not even MAN enough to admit that they lied.....this could have lead to his Value rising & the Trust &/or Love ??? being shared again equally amongst us.....for our benefit. By not stating his alleged lie WE now un-Trust him.....WE here do not hate him.......he fell on his own sword like many others I know because the Truth.....is & does come out eventually & that is my BELIEF. .....\nSo no more lies because WE do not value liars because OUR whole life is a lie.....& WE are all here to find OUR TRUTH & TRUST & TO BE LOVED......\nClive,<3",
