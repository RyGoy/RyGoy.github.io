   "message": "Moving on...take a break.  Get some perspective.  Do something good for yourself.  Six years is a long time to be upset.  Think about what you want for your daughter and find a way to convince your ex that your daughter will benefit.  Even bad parents want to \"believe\" they are doing the best for their children.  Do not approach this person unless you can do it without throwing in a boatload of emotional baggage.  When you are ready you can put together a list of ways both your ex, and your daughter can benefit from having you in her life.",
