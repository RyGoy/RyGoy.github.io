   "message": "best interest of the child is an advertising campaign slogan designed to bolster business for the child protection industry. They are getting paid to provide serves to victims,  and it is genious really, they confiscate kids in the name of their best interests( and just to cover the constitution aspect) the betterment of society.  the continuation of abuse to these poor children, once they have custody of the child ensures the continuation of a market for their services in the future.
