   "message": "i dont know either party. However his thread claimed it wanted to test the validity of OPPF.  he reacted badly to your nomination. personal insults between the 2 of you aside a few posts down he imagines \"He\" can defend the OPPF.... it does'nt inspire me with confidence about the level of critique which will be invested in finding the truth (that which cannot be rebutted)It is they who are claiming to make everyone a billionaire & save humanity from itself with an unknowing signature.",
