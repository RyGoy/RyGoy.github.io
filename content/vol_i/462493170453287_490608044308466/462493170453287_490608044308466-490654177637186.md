   "message": "FUCK FUCK FUCK and thrice FUCK again. I always knew deep down that the simplest way of defeating these psychos was to get the surety monkey off one�s back. It resonated with me so much, that in recent times I added wording at the bottom of my letters/notices etc stating for the avoidance of doubt that the flesh and blood body and personal property including all species of money belonging to James are not surety for the NAME/FICTITIOUS LEGAL ENTITY you are addressing in this matter. As clumsy as it may be I knew I was on the right track. I always thought this had to be the coup de gr�ce. I read some time ago information relating to YOU but put it on my brain�s back burner. Now Scott has explained it in a way I comprehend it�s right up front in there with the Surety Monkey. Thank You Scott. And yes I know about Alexander. Guess where I�m from. Oh, I think you know already :-)",
