   "message": "Don't cry Adam...it's not becoming on the Internet.  Your wife/girlfriend/whatever had strong feelings for you and you disappointed her in some ridiculous chick-shit kind of way.  The only way she has of hurting you is to deprive you of something you value.  She doesn't have the relationship she wants, but she does still have a relationship with you.  Many women are assholes in this regard.  If you let it affect you at the cellular level she controls you.  This is a problem to be solved.  Your child's mental health is riding on your ability to work this out.  No pressure :)",
