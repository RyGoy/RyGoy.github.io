   "message": "Pierre.. you mentioned just the other day that you wrote to QRA and said to them- \"...i am not the accused in this matter...\", and as a result, they switched you from being the Defendant to the Plaintiff right? Seems to me, and i dunno what Scott has to say about this, but if you're deemed to be the Plaintiff in this matter...do you not have the right then to just simply WITHDRAW the charges against QRA ?  :/",
