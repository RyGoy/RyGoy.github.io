   "message": "I know someone that appeared in traffic court earlier this year where he CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTED to enter a PLEA of GUILTY on the CONDITION that the CROWN provide the facts and evidence that the HIGHWAY TRAFFIC ACT applied to him. After providing them with his taken name they made him wait until the end of the session to hear the matter. When the matter was called he read an affidavit into the record affirming he is a man who HAS a PERSON but that he was not this PERSON. It was obvious to me why they QUASHED the matter....they wanted no record of it anywhere. He didn't even know the difference between DISMISSED and QUASHED. The Crown had to correct him when he used the word DISMISSED after the justice had said case QUASHED.",
