   "message": "Do you search or register UCCs?\n\nUCC stands for Uniform Commercial Code - it's a standard similar to PPSA used in the United States. We search and register the Canadian equivalent, PPSA. We do not search UCCs in the United States. For more information on performing UCC searches and registrations, consult the consumer and commercial registrar within the state you're interested in.",
