   "message": "there is no ruling with it Steve, the point of it (if you take it into a courtroom) is to make the court aware that there has been a mistake in any presumptions/beliefs they have that you are the person. If the questions cannot be answered then court shouldn't be proceeding to the point of a ruling. Questions negate understanding.  IF a case is thrown out or dropped as a result of the use of the notice of mistake, I doubt the Notice of Mistake or the premise behind it,  would be provided as the reason. They do NOT want the secrets of their deception revealed.",
