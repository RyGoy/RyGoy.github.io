The people who survived \"The Great Dogecoin Purge of 2014\" did so because they are actively participating. \n\nRead Pete's Dogecoin thread, the one with over 1,300 comments, that starts off with \"Hey, this is Captain Pete, with an ORDER, yes a fucking Orderï¿½. \". \n\nIf you have a Dogecoin wallet already, post the wallet address and join the list. If you don't have one, everything that you need to know is in that thread.",
