   "message": "agreed...my mistake, forgive me ;-) ...Scott Duncan is very specific in his language.  My question again though:  What are the ramifications of  the two actions, liening the name and the disposition of the person?  Are they two separate entities in law?  Is each copy of the BC a separate entity?  Or to pose a different question based around the same theme: When I sign a power of attorney over to the bank & they sign/create a bunch of documents/ promissory notes etc using the name, is the consequence of this action that they have created one or more persons with the same name?",
