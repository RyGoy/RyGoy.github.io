   "message": "I had something at one point in time, I (there is that nasty word) believe it was my live birth record, however when we went through a bust here at home, it was in a safe that the RCMP confiscated. And according to them there were no personal papers in it but it was in there. So what ever it was I son't know. but I do have driveres license and wernt ot school so Im guessing that is what it was.",
