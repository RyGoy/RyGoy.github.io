   "message": "The Admiral, with the help of the Captain and crew, is running a tight ship. Lead, follow, or get the fuck out of the way. \n\nWe are NOT the same group of a few months ago, Derek Hill.  We are VERY protective of what's happening here. That's not being \"stupid\".\n\nIf you have something to contribute, please play with/for the team. We have much respect for Captain Pete Daoust. \n\nI don't doubt you might have something to contribute, but keep the controversy out from this group.",
