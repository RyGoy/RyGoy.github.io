   "message": "I did it today, I put 3 notices of mistake one for me, the old man and the kids. I went to CPS lawyers office and tried to serve it on them, I asked for a date stamed copy back. The liar told me that she was as good as a date stamped copy she would attest to the fact that they received it. (I may have idiot stamp on my forehead till now but I washed it off and look at me now.)I told her no, i need it date stamped, started to protest and put her hand on it so I could not remove it. I just grabbed it up and walked out. She said as I was leaving and ignoring her, we will see you tomorrow in court Ms, Larson.",
