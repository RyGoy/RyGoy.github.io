   "message": "In the matter of SURETY for Gail Blackman, I believe that there has been a MISTAKE as the SOLE BENEFICIARY has been INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED as the accused. If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE Tender for Law AND/OR SUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led the COURT to believe by responding to �You� and or �Gail Blackman � and/or SUCH OTHER IDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am the PARTY WITH SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE and please forgive me.",
