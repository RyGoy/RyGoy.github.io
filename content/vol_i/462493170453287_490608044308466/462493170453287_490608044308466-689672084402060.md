   "message": "In my case, the Crown mumbled something about attempting to contact my ex husband, but he declined to attend so they'd just like to dismiss. The thing is, HE wasn't the one charging me, the Crown was, so there was no reason for him to be in attendance. But for anyone sitting in the courtroom listening, it sounded much better than saying \"Shit, she got us. We fold!\"",
