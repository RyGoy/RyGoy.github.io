   "message": "Scott Duncan I was re-reading  this today for the 3rd or 4th time and the point that popped out for me was that we are   \"The sole Beneficiary of the trust\". This weeds out a stain that I think I accumulated from watching one of Dean Clifford's videos some time ago where I believe he was saying that the \"government is the beneficiary of the legal name\". So let me get this  totally straightened out... We are the beneficiary. We are NOT the trustee. Our only attachment to the legal name we want to accept is as the administrator?",
