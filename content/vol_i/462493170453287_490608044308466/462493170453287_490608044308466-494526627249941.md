   "message": "No, I wondered that myself in the thread with my daughter. Its weird as they are using her fiction name, but threatening me as guardian. But they didn't use my fiction name specifically toward said threats. It was just stated. So in the case of using Notice of Mistake (being a mistake regarding the accused/whom is surety), to add in a Proof of Claim (being claim on me), yet still the claim in this case seems fine. I think that a Notice of Mistake directly challenges jurisdiction in that matter (which is the point).",
