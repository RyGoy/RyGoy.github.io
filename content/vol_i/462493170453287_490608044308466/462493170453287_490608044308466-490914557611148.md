   "message": "As i understand it the office of the judge didn't have authority to do what was done so therefore he took it upon himself, his knowing liability.. surety. I believe my case presents a greater opportunity as the first judge i encountered who asked for my details locked me up when i asked him to identify himself, 2nd judge recused herself 3rd judge actually ordered a jurisdiction hearing but then recused himself. I've been denied information central to my defence & therefore making an appeal pointless. I just want maximum damage & learn along the way.  2 friends of mine might be able to use the Notice of error with fines though.",
