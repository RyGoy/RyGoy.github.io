   "message": "regarding standing on this page & in court, it is just what cannot be considered, dont upset or take on scott/judge try to appeal to his decency or lack thereof....scott wants to see how much shit we will allow ourselves absorb because thats the same thing in us that the judge depends on in court. scott cannot be a group on his own, that gives us standing, you need us to fulfill your \"orders\", When we fail to understand you fail in your mission. You may quickly root out the weeds on here for the sake of the crop but you are very much planting seeds for a sustainable future. so you depend on us in the way a farmer depends on seeds, ok, you can throw a whole batch of bad seeds out but you must find more.",
