   "message": "Scott is quite clear that the law is all about INTENT. Then, using that logic, what was the INTENT of the Birth Certificate/Security of the Person then? To FUCK US, or to HELP US? I would like to think to HELP US. Its turning out however to FUCK US, as they are the ones who hold the keys to their own arcane rules they have yet to provide DISCLOSURE to us about as to how do WE, not our SERVANTS meant to SERVE us, WE, benefit from this SECURITY, which as i understand it, represents our share of whatever value/credit of ours is sitting in the CONSOLIDATED REVENUE FUND waiting to be CLAIMED by us that will just be deemed surplus and WASTED by them if we dont. :/",
