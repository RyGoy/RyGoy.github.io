Like I said before you're a waste of oxygen and my time. Fuck off!\n\nTony Boutros Sorry Dean but this guy deserves to be put in his place. He's a fuckin menace to society... On a different note, did you get my text I sent you earlier? \n\nTony Boutros Like I said Scott Duncan. You're an idiot wrapped in MORON! And furthermore you've got the IQ of a door knob. I never once said I support OPPT you moronic idiot. In fact, I've made it perfectly clear on several occasions on my group that I am suspicious of it. That's the reason I hosted a round table discussion you ignorant peace of shit so people who are undecided can hear the facts and decide for themselves. That does not in any shape or form constitute that I'm a supporter. But I guess you're too fucking stupid to understand that. Your lack of brain power can not comprehend this concept. My problem is your arrogant attitude that you think you know it all and you're nothing more than that 1 inch of slime you find at the bottom of commercial garbage bins. You might think you know shit but you're nothing. So, why don't you do us all a favor and take a very long walk on a short pier. Everything you ever posted here or anywhere else was nothing more than shit lip service. YOU NEVER BACK UP WHAT YOU SAY WITH FACTS OR EVIDENCE. So from me to you, GO FUCK YOURSELF \n\nOr maybe This guy?:\n\n****Geoffrey Franklin Finn***\nGeoffrey Franklin Finn: fuck off coward\n\n(This was his response to my denying an off-topic post)\n\nBecause these guys claim to be more \"valuable\".",
