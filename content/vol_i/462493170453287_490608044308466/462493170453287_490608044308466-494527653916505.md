   "message": "When I read NOTICE in Black's law and here Winston, it comes to mind that our best option is to stay PRIVATE and have them come to OUR COURT. By NOT ENTERING INTO CONTROVERSY in their JURISDICTION we can make our own law and our own COURT as a PRIVATE person whom has suffered from their MISTAKE. WINSTON is informing us again and again and again to face these PIRATES using STATUES in COMMON LAW as PRIVATE LIVING BEINGS. Forgive the rant. I'm trying to sort it out in my own head. Who will argue WINSTON SHROUT?",
