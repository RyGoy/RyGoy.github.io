   "message": "Again, speaking out of the ignorance of the lack of knowledge with your particular situation, you should be able to best a woman with mental health issues.  For the sake of your daughter take your emotions out of the equation, find out what your ex wants, and work something out.  Assuming she's not totally insane she should be receptive (on some level) to the fact that children need the guidance and companionship of both parents.  Otherwise the children blame themselves for the dissolution of what they perceive would otherwise be a happy relationship.  You connected with this woman once - she must be reachable on some level.  It is likely your ex cared for you deeply at one time; otherwise she wouldn't be punishing you this enthusiastically now (don't beat me Cheryl!)",
