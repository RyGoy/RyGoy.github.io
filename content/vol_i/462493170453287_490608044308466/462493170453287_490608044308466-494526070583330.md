   "message": "Interestingly, I see the word OR which tells us that we have a choice to decide what kind of NOTICE we will PRESENT. Will we draft this notice or that? Obviously, we can't draft a notice that is both this OR/AND that, because we must choose which kind of NOTICE we will draft. Therefore, the question that presents itself is which kind of NOTICE we will draft. Scott instructs us to draft a PROPER NOTICE. Sounds good to me because in legal land I like things to be proper. The definition that I posted (the word of law) suggests a few important details might be important for us to distinguish between. Details which SCOTT never mentioned (curiously). I wonder why? Nevertheless, the point is that as I read the definition of NOTICE, the better option between this OR that is the second option where a fact is ESTABLISHED! Scott never mentioned that we can establish that a mistake was made prior to entering a BANKER'S court. If I read this right, and, I understand the meaning of NOTICE, our best option is to RECORD the NOTICE OF MISTAKE prior to going to their COURT. The second option puts \"them\" in OUR COURT! Am I on track? Has this been a TEST to find out who's paying attention? Am I missing something?",
