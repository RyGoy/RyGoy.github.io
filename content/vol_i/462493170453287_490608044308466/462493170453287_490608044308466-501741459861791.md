(Scratch head)\nWhy is it such a bad thing for OUR daughter to sleep with either parent Pierre??\nI've never ever exposed OUR daughter to any of my lovers  as I'm tge fussiest fucker on earth when it comes to wimen & all I've seen out there so far is millions of women that suffer frim DUMB KUNT SYNDROME.
