   "message": "At Dean Clifford's seminar here in Toronto last year, i got there early and was talking to a guy, who was hardcore about how whenever one of his public-TRUSTees did not act as he deemed with TRUSTworthiness towards him, he would rifle off one of his NOTICE OF FIDUCIARY TRUSTEE notices to them, calmly explaining to them that they are being paid a job to do that he is helping contribute towards with the taxes he is forced to give so that they can have a job which is to do whatever is in his best interests and gave them a list of what he thought their Fiduciary-Duties were to be towards him. I liked that guy.",
