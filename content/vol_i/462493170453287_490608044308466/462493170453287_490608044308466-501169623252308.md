   "message": "I am going to apologize to ADAM.   I definitely have \"bitch disorder\" lately.  I have been on a new medication.  I probably am a fruit cake that's been in the oven too long..my true intention though is that whiny people remind me of myself and what I did for most of my life and  that is not Adam's problem. It wasn't right for me to put my problem onto him.  But also, I know the difference in my life from  trying to over come that mindset  and learning the difference between venting and whining.   Apparently, still need to learn to examine my motives more carefully before speaking. What I said about victims though is still true. and it was meant to be helpful in an ass backwards way.",
