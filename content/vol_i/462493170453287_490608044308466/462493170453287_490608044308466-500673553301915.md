   "message": "I applied a short while ago to the quebec govn. for my live birth record and BC. I was told that I need to supply them with my baptismal certif. I dont have one cause my mother was athiest. So they wanted to know which hospital I was born. I don't know just now it was Montreal. They phoned me back and said they need my batismal certif. told them I don't have one, they said they can see where I was born. So told them forget the BC just send me the live birth record. Apparently that is not part of their records, that belongs to hospital. I said tell me what hospital I was born at and I will get it my self. Vital Statisics said no and hung up. So according to them I need my live birth record, baptismal certif. and one form of id and $ 104.00 and they will be more than happy to do one up for me.",
