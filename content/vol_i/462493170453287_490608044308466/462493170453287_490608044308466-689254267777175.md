WATCH WHAT I BUILD, CRUSH YOU, BIT-BY-BIT, WHILE I TELL YOU, EACH STEP OF THE WAY, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU!\n\n... you see folks, Menard (And the government, for that matter) LOVE to say I'm \"crazy\". I never dispute it. Better people than Menard have suggested it...\n\n...except I'm only \"crazy\", until REALITY says I'm not. \n\nIt doesn't MATTER if Menard thinks I'm \"crazy\". \nIt doesn't MATTER if the Government says I'm \"mentally Ill\".\n\nReality doesn't care. 2+2 STILL equals 4. It doesn't MATTER what worthless people say/think/believe... \n\n...I'll still win.",
