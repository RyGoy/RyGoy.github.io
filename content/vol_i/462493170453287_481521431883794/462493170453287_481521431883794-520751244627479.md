   "message": "The effort, time & energy that you guys expend & sacrifice from your time together to instil some knowledge & even more powerfully, a willingness in some/all of us to learn, to question, to think (hopefully) & to develop the skills to be able to ask better questions in order to receive more useful answers, is rare, priceless & greatly valued.\n\nRegardless of Scott's motivations & frustrations, the tough love/hating us all etc has opened doors that cannot be closed and is greatly appreciated.\n\nI am unaware of the rewards and/or pleasure derived from this for Scott, beyond the fact that you are honouring your oath & that you have the love and support of a remarkable woman.\n\nAnd Tara, thanks for giving us the necessary kick in the tail to maintain the focus & for all the unseen things you obviously do behind the scenes.\n\nFor what it's worth, couples like you are rare & I'm glad to have the opportunity to interact with & learn from you.  Thank you.",
