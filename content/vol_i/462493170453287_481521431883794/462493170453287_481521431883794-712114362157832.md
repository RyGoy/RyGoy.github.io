   "message": "Excellent article Tara! It is sad when people don't appreciate all the hard work and long hours that goes into helping others and teaching them the truth! It's proves an even greater task when people are so indoctrinated with garbage information and they fight and argue to prove idiotic fallacies even they don't understand the words they speak and argue over. I for one have taken myself  off all other groups as they are all literally a waste of time and effort to bother with. The tender for law is the only group I now follow with eagerness both to learn and put into practice what I have learned from Scott and all who contribute good information to the threads. I look forward to continuing my journey and learning all I can ,Hopefully becoming a valuable asset to this navy one day. Thanks again to all who have taken the time to answer my questions and help me along my way! You are all amazing people and have helped me so much and didn't ask anything of me and don't even know me. If I can ever be of service to you, by all means I am a message away.",
