   "message": "I know I have not been here as long as most of you have. But I am not any less grateful. I also see that my comments come off wrong and my intent is misplaced. Because my intent is to aid not hinder and this has caused more harm then good. I accept that. But I have worked at not doing that. I think wrong and value the wrong things. I ponder this each and every day and even in my sleep. I have been having weird dreams. I contribute this from all my studies here. I am sorry if I have seemed rude but I don't have any time to waste. every second that passes is a second I don't have to learn something of value to me. Thank you for letting me be a part of this. I don't have weed or hookers but what I have is my time. Thank you Scott Ducan. and all the rest that make this possible.  Sincerely your's  outcast",
