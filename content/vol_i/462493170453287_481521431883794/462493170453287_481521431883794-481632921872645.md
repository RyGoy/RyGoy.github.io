   "message": "I am truly grateful for Scott and what he is doing here. I feel he doesn't need anyone to \"stick up\" for him as he surely does a fine job on his own but have seen others stick up for him nonetheless. ï¿½Not to mention we have to put up with his continual ridicule, he seems to still put up with our stupidity. He is challenging me, even though I wanna kick him in the balls sometimes... I have learned more in the last week than in the last 4 months from him and would gladly pitch in on as much weed 'n hookers as he can handle... :D",
