The Bank's run the world...its so frigging hard no matter what we do ...And the Judges are calling more people Freeman .So they think they can get away with not answering to us ... The Judge Delay is the one that was in the paper talking about Robert Mernard ..that was the same Judge that heard my case..fat chance I would have going in front of him to rectify what they did to me ....... Thank's I will inform my friend .",
