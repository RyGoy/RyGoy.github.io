   "message": "Three words: SECURITY FOR COSTS\n\nThis is the best part about defending. Most cases die right there. If your friend has PROOF (Signed discharge is proof), demand security for costs. This means they must deposit to the court, a sum that you determine to be \"reasonable\" to cover costs. It's almost always granted. (You won't get an eleventy billion dollar security order)\n\nThe problem here, is that it's a bank. They have money to burn for this stuff. They'll just pay it.",
