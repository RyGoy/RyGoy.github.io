   "message": "*sigh* Lee Lai...i tried to tell you, this group does NOT do the 'lovey-dovey' stuff - and, Scott was amazingly reserved by saying: \"I have an exam at the royal conservatory of music. it's a Cello recital! Grade 8!\n\nCan somebody quickly explain...\n\nHow does one play a cello?\"\n\nYou should ask him instead for tips on how to fill-out the form to place a LIEN on YOUR property/the stolen-condo.....i suspect that you will want to make good use of the \"EXTRA INFORMATION\" box to describe exactly how the bank had no trouble at the time initially ACCEPTING your EFT, then DISCHARGING your mortgage, before they went- \"we just decided to change our minds, PSYCHE- you still owe us the money,\" on you\n\nhttp://www.ppsa.ca/ppsacaV3//registration/index.jsp",
