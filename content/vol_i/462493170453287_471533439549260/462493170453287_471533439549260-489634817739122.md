   "message": "So it turns out there is a group of about 10 out in Brampton who mastered EFT-setoffs, but are now being targeted 2 and-a-half-months-later after the bank seemingly goes along with it initially, with the bank taking them to court saying they have just decided on their own to reverse the debt that, oh by the way, the bank agreed to zero-out and discharge in the first place. First guy up lost, and was told right-off-the-bat by the Judge that he wouldnt be tolerating any of that \"Freeman stuff in his court today,\" told EFT-guy NOT to object to anything until the Bank-lawyer had finished speaking at the end, and was seen winking to the Bank-lawyer, before he issued a summary-judgement against EFT-guy. :/",
