   "message": "Pete: Lee was paying off a mortgage like everyone else does as usual...somewhere along the way she learned how to do an EFT/Electronic Funds Transfer.\n\nEFT = Electronic Funds Transfer.. supposedly a cheque that has 'cheque' crossed-out, and deposited, into a closed-chequing-account.. on the public or private side i forget (as it was told to me)\n\nHer bank accepted the instrument, and not only discharged her mortgage apparently, but, ALSO sent her a $4008 cheque for some reason that i really dont get. Everything seemed ok, then, like the other 10 people in the group she was a part of doing this, the bank does a complete ABOUT-FACE, and basically says that they've just changed their minds and that that OH BY THE WAY, you still owe us the remaining on your mortgage. The whole time keep in mind, they have NEVER returned the EFT/Instrument/Negotiable Instrument. They get an order for a Writ of Possession against her, and let her know she has a certain time before she gets evicted...which happened last week with her condo being stormed by 9 cops and the City Sheriff.",
