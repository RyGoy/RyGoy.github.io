   "message": "We're actually getting together today to talk about this. I told him about how Eustace Mullins and Bill Thornton have said that you never want to go into court a defendant, always a plaintiff. So before he answers their Statement-of-Claim, he is going to file his own claim against them - not a counterclaim, not a cross-claim, a separate claim.. Superior Court of Ontario.. Inheritance Jurisdiction.. issue an ORDER beforehand appointing the Judge the fiduciary.. he as the Administrator.. a count of good-ole common law blackmail/Extortion/FRAUD.. triple-damages.. let a jury decide.. ;)",
