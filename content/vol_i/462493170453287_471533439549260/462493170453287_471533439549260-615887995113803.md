   "message": "\"You weren't LISTENING or what ??\"\n\nI went up with her to the podium, because she wanted me to help her get across what she wanted to say because she easily starts to ramble, Pete. I got out to the Justice that it was important to note that her INTENT was NOT to MOTION the court, but to PETITION the court, but, that the Clerk she dealt with would NOT allow her to PETITION the court, and would only accept a MOTION from her. Then, i just let him know that her INTENT was to CLAIM the jurisdiction of a COURT OF EQUITY and be heard there. At that point he just looked at me and said- \"Are you here as her COUNSEL, are you her LAWYER, if not, just take a seat.\" I said she is \"deficient at law your Justice and she has asked me to help her get across what she hopes to accomplish with today to the court\"(or something like that)....\"well if you're not her lawyer or counsel you have to sit down\"....then i hold-up my Dictionary of Canadian Law and say- \"Actually the definition for COUNSEL in here your Justice says- 'An ADVISER whether or not he is a lawyer...\"\n\nAt this point, two court-officers stand-up and tell me to sit-down, i didnt wanna fuck anything up for her, but Lee herself said it was ok and asked me just to sit-down",
