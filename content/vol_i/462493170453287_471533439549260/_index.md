   "message": "So a friend-of-a-friend, SOMEHOW, through his knowledge with the magical-use of EFTs(Electronic Fund Transfers), manages to discharge the rest of his mortgage with it - and, more importantly..one of the major Banks he was dealing with, under their own free will, went along with it and discharges the mortgage for him. Great, right? Wrong. Three months later the Bank is back, basically saying- \"We changed our mind.. you have to re-pay us $260,000.. you've got til February 28th to vacate the premises...\"  I can only think of 5 words: KOO-KOO, FOR-COCOA-PUFFS",
