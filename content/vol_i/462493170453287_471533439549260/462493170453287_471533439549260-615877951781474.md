   "message": "Beverly, Pete: well today was certainly interesting...Old Osgoode Hall on Queen St...Justice starts explaining to Lee that- \"...the problem is i suspect you're in the wrong jurisdiction, this is normally a STATUTORY COURT, you're in the Court of Appeal, you want to be in the INHERITANCE JURISDICTION, thats in the Superior Court, we just happen to hear APPEALS for the Inheritance Jurisdiction, too\"\n\nTHEN- he matter-of-factly says the most amazing thing that nobody of the several people that were there to support her picked-up on except me...this STATUTORY Justice then nonchalantly says- \"I'm probably giving away too much information already...but unless you give me the POWER there's nothing i can do to help you\"...then at the end, he keeps saying to her a few times when she ran out of things to say, so as to say that he was trying to tell her something without being able to tell her straight-out- \"Was there anything ELSE that you wanted to say...?\"\n\nOther than that- when Lai said that banks were fraud and that corporations were corrupt and where is there Justice?? The Justice made everyone laugh in the courtroom by agreeing that- \"Well, umm- YES...the system is COMPLEX, and, i readily admit that, it is not all that USER-FRIENDLY\"\n\nBut Ceit, Lou- can you shed some light on what he meant when he said: \"I'm probably giving away too much information already...but unless you give me the POWER there's nothing i can do to help you\"",
