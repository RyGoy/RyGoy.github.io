   "message": "I put my signature to it, but from what I can tell, acting as credit provider/grantor...now the trustee (mortgage company/lender) has the right to act as me (in the capacity as credit provider/grantor) & create their own beneficiary or complete the blanks on any other document as they see fit...\n\nThis to me means the trustee now has the right to assign the mortgage, create security instruments etc...I am hoping for some feedback from others with a similar situation before I write to the mortgage company demanding full disclosure, so I have a better idea as how to best proceed...like I said above, I'm willing to be a crash test dummy on this ;)",
