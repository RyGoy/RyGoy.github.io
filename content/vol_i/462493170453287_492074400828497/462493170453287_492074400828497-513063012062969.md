   "message": "Derek Moran: Here is exactly what Frank O'Collins said: \"A mortgage masks, that even if you pay off the mortgage, you will only ever be, what is described as a ward-tennant or a tennant-in-common, a tennant of the ward, the ward being the council(city), under the guardianship of your council, and you are considered either mentally-unstable or an incompetent or a pauper, and that is ultimately your standing in their eyes.. you are never an owner, only a tennant, and owner is not the bank, the ultimate landlord is the council of your county.. and the purpose of the birth-certificate, is to provide you with the proof that you are not a pauper, and that you do have an equitable-share in all of this.\"",
