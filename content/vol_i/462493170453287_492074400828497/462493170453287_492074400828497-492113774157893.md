   "message": "Scott mentioned this before and said he's done it a couple of times. \n\nAs the creditor you credit the bank with the security/promissory note. You pay back the principle plus interest. When it's paid off you reclaim the principle and the bank keeps the interest. That's how it's supposed to work apparently...You're simply giving the bank a financial instrument... Something like that...\n\nIf I remember correctly, Scott said it's all in the contract...",
