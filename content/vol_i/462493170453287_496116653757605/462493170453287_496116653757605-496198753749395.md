   "message": "Lets imagine the MAN got arrested. Maybe they assinged the NAME a \"PUBLIC DEFENDANT\". In a later hearing, maybe a NOT GUILTY PLEA was made on behalf of the NAME by the PUBLIC DEFENDANT. BAIL was GRANTED. Lets imagine that while on BAIL, the PUBLIC DEFENDER was fired by the PERSON. A NOTICE was entered into the court file NOTICING the PUBLIC DEFENDANT was no longer REPRESENTING the NAME, along with the filling of the SURETY BOND AND LEGAL NAME into custody of the court. A NOTICE OF MISTAKE was sent via registered mail to the \"jugde\" and the prostitutor (no offense to prostitutes), along with copy of the VOID offer to contract to APPEAR in trial, and copy of the BC. The PARTIES have been NOTICED, they got the REGISTERED POST. There is/was a trail to be held, lets imagine, maybe April 1st. The NOTICE OF MISTAKE has NOT been filed into the court record, yet, waiting to see if there is any kind of RESPONSE or ACTION taken. I would imagine hell will freeze over first, before they reply with a thank you note.  Well, what an IMAGINATION I have. Maybe, those are the available IMAGINARY FACTS.",
