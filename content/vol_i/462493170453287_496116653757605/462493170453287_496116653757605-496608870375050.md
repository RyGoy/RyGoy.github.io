You are either LYING, or trying to MISS LEAD others here, and \"nobody's got time for that\"! :p I CHALLENGE YOU to provide PROOF I said, or even suggested, Scott's Duncan NOTICE would not \"hold\". Ouch! Busted! I have NEVER said that. Watch out, baby girl, don't you come mess with the BIG boys! And my reason thinking Scott's Duncan NOTICE would work was not because of the LAW (the rapist's LAWS), but because they have no VALID CONTRACT, and no CONSENT, and SLAVERY would be put in front of everyone to see, even MORE clear than today, despite the approval of the HOUSE NIGGERS with a strong BELIEF in their MASTER's LAW. Cant James Baal, Pierre, and others see I am in YOUR SIDE? Who are YOU DEFENDING? The CROWN? Did you all took an OATH towards the CROWN? Did you all signed a VALID CONTRACT? You bunch of BELIEVERS! I petty you! :)",
