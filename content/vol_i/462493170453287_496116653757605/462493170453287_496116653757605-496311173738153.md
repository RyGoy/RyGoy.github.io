   "message": "In the case of my imaginary friend, I see is no simple matter at hand, for many reasons. Now, lets entertain this situation for a moment. What if my imaginary friend indeed committed the offense. He APOLOGIZES, and asks for FORGIVENESS to her partner. She in turn accepts his apology, and FORGIVES HIM. If there is not any meeting of the minds, any PROPER NOTICE given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or that I have ANY INTENT to CONTRACT, so... At this point WHAT THE HECK IS THE STATE OF FLORIDA TRYING TO COLLECT MONEY for an act that has been already FORGIVEN by the victim?",
