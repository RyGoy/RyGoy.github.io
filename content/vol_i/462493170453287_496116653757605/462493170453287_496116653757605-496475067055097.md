   "message": "The question would still apply, Dear Pierre: BY WHICH AUTHORITY must a WOMAN be FORCED to talk to the CROWN, without CONSENT? WHO is the CROWN? When was the CROWN was granted AUTHORITY over MEN (did you all miss that chapter?)? Where is our CONTRACT? Is the CROWN a SLAVE MASTER? IS the WOMAN a SLAVE? Am I one of those they would send to those \"psychiatric\" evaluations, just for asking for something as simple as PROOF OF CLAIM, by SHOWING A CONTRACT, OR A BILL OF SALE FOR MY BODY?",
