   "message": "Hmmmmm....long post that's gone in lots of different directions & I came in late...my 2 cents worth on the imaginary friend:  Your thread Maximiliano P�rez, so feel free to critique, same goes for anyone else :-)\n\nIf the imaginary 'she' called the police, that could be construed as an invitation to contract on her behalf...if the imaginary girl didn't call the police but accepted their offer to contract by offering a statement etc & did it in the name of the 'person', against another 'person', then that could be construed as accepting an offer to contract.\n\nIf anything has been done through/as/on behalf of the person, and the 'person' is the creation/property of the corporation, then they have every right to intervene to deal with 'their' property/cattle.\n\nThe MAN & WOMAN can then notice the corporation of the mistake that he and/or she are the 'person' or were acting in that capacity at the time of any alleged real or imaginary incident...ie: NOTICE OF MISTAKE.\n\nAs for the philosophical/moral issues & questions re LAW & the ability of one MAN to judge another MAN, eg: Common Law concepts of harm etc, or books with imaginary friends talking about judging one another by their actions or by the supreme imaginary friend's laws, or Maxims of law that make statements such as: \n\nAn equal has no dominion over an equal (Par in parem imperium non habet) Black�s 7th p.1673\n\nThe power which is derived cannot be greater than that from which it is derived (derativa potestas non poteste esse major primitiva) Bouvier�s 1856,\n\nThese are examples of 'beliefs' that are relied upon by a MAN to be considered equal, and to be superior to a fiction (eg: government)...in other words, a reliance on a stated BELIEF that is used in a legal system, to establish the basis of your argument that you may be relying upon to support your particular situation. \n\nMaybe the 'government' relies on the belief that might is right, the power of coercion & corruption trumps all & presumptions of such confer implied consent by the governed/person & that the person=Man etc...\n\nSo, my take on this is it comes back to each individual's ability to behave consistently with the moral code they choose to live by, and to be able to rebut the presumptions of others when they attempt to impose/enforce their code/rules etc & to be able to remove themselves from the jurisdiction and/or defend themselves by whatever means necessary, to be aware that rights incur responsibilities, actions have consequences & ultimately:\n1.  Don't lie about an action (the imaginary man hit me)\n2.  Don't then call the 'rapist' to beat up on the imaginary man\n3.  After calling the 'rapist' & asking for their help, DO expect the rapist  to want to rape you...after all, that's what rapists do!\n\nBut my biggest concern is the following:\nWhat facts throughout history, can anyone here rely on, to suggest that 'All are equal'???  \n\nTell it to the native American tribes, the Australian natives, the maoris, the victims of the Khmer Rouge....the list is exhaustive...\n\nThat in itself is a BELIEF that has a huge amount of cognitive dissonance associated with it...and it  further confirms the statement from Scott Duncan aka the Oracle, that all belief is evil.",
