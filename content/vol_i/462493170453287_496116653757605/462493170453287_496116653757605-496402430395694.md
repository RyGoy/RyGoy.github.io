   "message": "<<Stockholm syndrome, or captureï¿½BONDING, is a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors, sometimes to the point of defending them. These feelings are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims, who essentially mistake a lack of abuse from their captors for an act of kindness.>> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome",
