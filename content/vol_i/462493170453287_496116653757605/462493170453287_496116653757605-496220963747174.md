   "message": "This is what \"Judge Dale\", the annonymouse \"judge\", has to say: <<At your Arraignment or Trial, the Judge will ask you if you are the named individual [ALL CAPS BIRTH NAME] on the complaint and your natural response will be to answer in the affirmative but that is exactly what you don�t want to do!\n\nRemove your Birth Certificate and respond to him by stating:  I am making a Special Limited Appearance on behalf of the defendant who is right here and [hold up your Birth Certificate!]\n\nThen state the following:  As I understand this process Judge; the County Attorney [or] Police Officer has leveled a criminal charge with the Clerk and against the TRUST, using the ALL CAPS NAME that appears on this BIRTH CERTIFICATE!  The use of capital letters is dictated by the US Printing Style Manuel, which explains how to identify a CORPORATION.\n\nThe Clerk, who is the ADMINISTRATOR of the CESTA QUE TRUST, then, appointed you Judge as the TRUSTEE for the TRUST and since neither of you can be the BENEFICIARY, that leaves me and therefore you are MY TRUSTEE!\n\nSo as MY TRUSTEE, I instruct you to discharge this entire matter, with prejudice and award the penalties for these crimes to be paid to me in compensation and damages for my false arrest!\n\nNOTE: The Law of Trusts dictates that an Administrator; Trustee and Beneficiary cannot serve two positions in a Trust.  So a Trustee cannot be a Beneficiary too!\n\nThe TRUSTEE Judge has no alternative but to honor your demands but you have to get this right and act with confidence!  You really need to know this information well, so that you can�t be hoodwinked or confused by either of them!  They will or may attempt to play some mind games with you if you display any doubt; stammer or display a lack confidence!  Appearances [the pomp and majesty] of these pseudo Courts, is totally for your benefit and is intended to invoke fear and intimidation!  If you show fear or intimidation, you get a pony ride!\n\nNOTE: I�ve seen and heard of Judges and Prosecutors interfering with a defendant�s response, which made the defendant, become confused and he was subsequently committed into a mental hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.  The Judge and Prosecutor successfully twisted what the defendant was trying to say and then the Judge Ordered a mental evaluation.\n\nUnderstand that the County Attorney will be forced to pay the Cost of Court out of his own pocket, if the case is discharged, so he isn�t going to give up that easily and the Judge; Clerk and County Attorney, stand to make a pretty penny off of your conviction and incarceration!  So don�t screw it up�\n\nIf the County Attorney begins to act too cocky with you, you can take the wind out of his sails by asking him to produce the 1040 for this case?  If he denies the need to do such a thing, inform him that you will be taking care of that for him ASAP [as soon as possible]!  He may move for a discharge at that point because you are a little too dangerous or smart!  The last thing that Prosecutor wants is the IRS examining his files for the last seven years because he makes money on every conviction but he doesn�t pay TAXES on them as a Rule!  He usually only declares the salary he receives.\n\nAlso: Should you accidentally find yourself in a mental hospital; the Psychiatrist who is assigned or appointed to evaluate you is just as corrupt as the Judge; Clerk and County Attorney and he will falsify all of your responses to him, just so that you are recommitted back into the mental facility with a review in six months!  So lie to him and deny that you ever made such remarks!  Of course, if you accept the criminal charges against your Birth Certificate, then you will instantly be deemed SANE!\n\nSorry that I had to be the one to tell you this but this is how corrupt many of my fellow Judges truly are and it should explain why my conscience caused me to retire early!  Before I learned what was really going on; I believed that my duties and performance were entirely Constitutional.  I was lied too also!>> http://lucas2012infos.wordpress.com/2012/05/25/judge-dale-retired-the-great-american-adventure-secrets-of-america-part-1-5-25-may-2012/",
