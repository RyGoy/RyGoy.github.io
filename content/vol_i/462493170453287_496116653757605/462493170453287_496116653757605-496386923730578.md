   "message": "You have said it, Joel. Perhaps, the only way a LAW may apply to a MAN is if he BELIEVES (therefore CONSENT, FREE WILL) that there is a LAW that applies to him, even thou he wasn't, unlike Scott, signed a VALID CONTRACT to OBEY the LAW. Its called VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE. But a \"judge\" or a \"prostitutor\" will NEVER show ANY LAW that would bound a living man to slavery, and involuntary servitude, without CONSENT, and without a VALID CONTRACT, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIST. IF IT IS NOT WRITTEN, IT IS NOT LAW!!! I rest my case. Back to my good hemp brownies, now. :)",
