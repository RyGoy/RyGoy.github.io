   "message": "\"After he comes out on BAIL, she confesses to Him, asked for forgiveness, and forgave each other\"...\n\nI would have liked to have heard the pillow talk after the 'forgiveness'...based around the presumption and in the context that all law is contract:\n\nHer to him:  Snookums, I'm so sorry that I didn't read the fine print in our contract that we have a non-exclusive license agreement that enables you to dump your DNA all over another non-exclusive license holder's chest.  I was under the mistaken presumption that ours was an exclusive license agreement.\n\nHim to her:  I'm sorry too Diddums, I didn't read your amendment to our agreement stating that any non-exclusive licensing to any third party confers implied consent for you to embed your fingernails in my face or enforce 'other measures' that may or may not be disclosed in the original agreement.  Furthermore, I didn't read the clause that states you have the right to hire the services of a subcontractor to assist you in enforcing said rights.\n\nHer to him:  Unfortunately Snookums, I told the subcontractor that YOU would pick up the tab for their services, because fact of the matter is, after we engaged their services, they performed the tasks I asked of them & they haven't received any compensation yet, and it was YOU and YOUR actions that created my obligation to engage the services of said subcontractor...\n\nHim to her:  But Diddums, I am not a party to your agreement with the subcontractor, so they have no valid claim to pursue the matter with me...they may want to pursue YOU though. After all, YOU engaged their services & they may want to pursue YOU for a false claim or at the very least a call out fee...but I'm glad WE forgave each other...for now...\n\nSomehow, I get the feeling that this imaginary drama/thread between the imaginary guy & imaginary girl needs a 'TO BE CONTINUED' note, cos there is no way there's going to be a Disney happily ever after...",
