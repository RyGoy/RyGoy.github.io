   "message": "I possess a 1993 issued certified hand written copy of my birth certificate, it is beautiful penmanship hand written script, in proper first letter capitol; remainder lower case of the name, the double dip trick is the use of the 3 capitol letter initials which creates a federal jurisdiction because they can only SEE (as in catholic bishop) those capitols and spaces and blank is omitted making the initials DJ federal speak, just like MA for massachusetts. tie DAJ and the cusip id # together and you have a stock certificate. it's like some letters are written in the same red ink as the cusip, and they look at it (SEE) through a red lens like at the 3d movies.",
