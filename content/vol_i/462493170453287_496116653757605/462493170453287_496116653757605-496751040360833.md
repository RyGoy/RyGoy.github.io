Now she tries to tell the prosecutor she forgave him, and she does not want to testify against him. Well, prostitutor subpoena her, to make sure she appears and they can $$$.\"   The same happened to a friend of mine and when the cops came to the door with the summons/subpoena she told them she didn't want it and didn't accept it. So they posted it, she returned it marked NO CONTRACT. I told her to stay at home on the day of the trial which she did. I went to the trial, my friend was called to the dock and when they called the girlfriend to the witness stand she didn't appear. The case was dropped due to lack of evidence and nothing happened after that. I was in court and saw this happen. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE .",
