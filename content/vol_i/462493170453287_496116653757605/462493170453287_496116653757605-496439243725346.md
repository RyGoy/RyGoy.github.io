   "message": "I think there is a possibility of creating a HUGE fatal error to the STATE's \"case\". If they BOTH put on the record an affidavit of truth with a PRAECIPE TO DISMISS, via NOTARY CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE VIA REGISTERED MAIL, with extreme prejudice, along with both BC, affirming they are MAN and WOMAN, and are WAIVING THEIR HUMAN RIGHT to be recognized as PERSONS; That SHE has FORGIVEN HIM, and That HE has FORGIVEN HER. That it is their wish to solve ANY/ALL matters in the PRIVATE, and they DO NOT CONSENT TO A 3 PARTY being involved, NOR they CONSENT TO ANY/ALL PROCEEDINGS. Affidavits of other PEOPLE attesting to what they are doing, and what the wishes of the MAN and WOMEN are. IF for any reason outside of LAW, their bodies are FORCED TO APPEAR, they will exercise SILENCE, and then follow thru with charges for criminal breach of trust, kidnapping, extortion, etc. That, or Im still on time to suggest the Panama thing. What do you all think about this possibility?",
