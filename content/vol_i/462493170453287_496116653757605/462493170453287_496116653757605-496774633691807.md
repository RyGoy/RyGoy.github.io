   "message": "I conditionally accept your claim of: 'I, a MAN, CLAIM DOMINION over all the living things on EARTH that are NOT other MEN. I also CLAIM DOMINION over all \"natural resources\". I CLAIM I will NOT rule over other MEN, and that I will share DOMINION ONLY with other MEN. Now, BY WHICH AUTHORITY, any other MAN, can rebut my CLAIM in LAW', upon proof of claim that: \n\n1.  There is not already a pre-existing claim in existence\n2.  That you have the ability to enforce said claim as and when  \n     challenged\n3.  Proof of contracts with 'other MEN', individually & severally, that \n     constitutes a valid binding agreement of said individual and/or joint \n     dominion.\n\nFurthermore, I attest that I am aware of no evidence that you can successfully enforce your claim, or of any valuable consideration you have offered in exchange for said claim & believe that none exists.\n\nAlso, should you wish to make such claims, what privileges & benefits do you offer in exchange for the support of such claims?  After all, with rights come responsibilities, and you may need a few million allies to help you enforce said claims ;-)",
