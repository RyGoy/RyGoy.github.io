   "message": "Before I posted my imaginary thead, I wanted to tell my imaginay friend NOT to show-up that day, because that would be crazy (to me, a domplete contradiction). And I would try to keep everything in the PRIVATE. To prepare an affidavit affirming he is a man, and all the other good stuff that he has done to clear this MISTAKE, just in case a WARRANT for the arrest of the name is somehow issued. If that happens, I would suggest to send via a CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE using a notary, would send registered mail all the goodies to the clerk of the court, for filing. I also wanted to tell him, to buy a plane ticket to Panama, just in case the MEN IN BLACK went after him. But, I want to listen what this respectable group have to say about it. I would be \"sad puppy face\" if my IMAGINARY friend goes to imaginary jail, because of some stupid technicallity. I only have one Imaginary friend. It would be unbearable. ;)",
