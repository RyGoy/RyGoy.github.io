   "message": "So, do MEN have a CONTRACT with Plato, and his quote could be FORCED into MAN on the 21st Centery? Is Plato PROOF that the LAW applies, without CONSENT, to another MAN today? I just want to be clear, Joel. But if there is really LAW, then it MUST CONFORM to LAW, and it has to be explicit, and written. So, please ANYONE FIND THE LAW THAT WOULD EXPLICITLY STATE the AUTHORITY that would give a MAN authority over another MAN, WITHOUT CONSENT, and without a VALID CONTRACT? What is that LAW? WHERE is that LAW at?",
