   "message": "So the REASONING is: 1) its all bullshit. 2) So, if you are charged with a fake crime, just rub it off. 3) But if you commit a real \"crime\", then the bullshit has the moral authority to turn into real? How can the courts be invalid for somethings, but valid for others? Who gave this people such power? BY WHICH AUTHORITY these people can \"judge\" another MAN?
