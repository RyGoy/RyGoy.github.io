   "message": "My IMAGINARY friend is not called JOE, nor he is a COP. He is a MAN. Lets say he did a little face smashing. Nothing serious. But, the STATE OF FLORIDA wants some money. They have a \"witness\" that is a NAME, and a TRIAL date. They are salivating for the dough, because he was already 1 month and a half in the hoper (no money for lord BAIL), and they think this is just another case like any other. Beverly May, should the affivadit be FILED on the court record? Or, should eveything remain in the private, still?",
