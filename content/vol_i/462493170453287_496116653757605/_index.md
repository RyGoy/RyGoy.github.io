   "message": "I have a hypothetical situation, I would like a hypothetical answer, for entertaintment purposes only, because I am not asking for any kind of advice. If you know what I mean. \nLet's imagine: a MAN is being mistaken by the NAME, and being IDENTIFIED as SURETY for the NAME/TRUST. The NAME was charged with some criminal stuff, after a fight with his girlfriend's NAME, and a TRIAL has been set for, lets say April 1st.\nLet's imagine this is in the STATE OF FLORIDA. The MAN is out on BOND. The NAME has now fired his \"PUBLIC DEFENDANT\". The MAN has filed the NAME/BC/SURETY BOND into the court file, getting the NAME in the CUSTODY of the court. The MAN has sent the judge, and prosecutor, via registered mail, a NOTICE OF MISTAKE, along with copy of the VOID order, and copy of the BC. He has not filed the NOTICE OF MISTAKE into the court file, hoping this can be resolved in the PRIVATE. The PROSECUTOR got the REGISTERED MAIL NOTICE, and the judge, soon, will as well. TRIAL is set for april 1st.\nIf You would imagine being in the shoes of this MAN, what steps would be required to make sure this matter is SETTLED and CLOSED, given all the facts so far? Has this MAN missed any steps?\nTheorerically, the NOTICE and SURETY BOND should take care of the closing and settleling of this matter, just like the NOTICE asserts. My IMAGINARY friend would have to be very strong to stand on his facts. But ANY hypothetical additional ideas on this matter, are welcome. Like for example: if the MAN gave PROPER NOTICE OF MISTAKE but just via registerd mail, deposited the LEGAL NAME into the CUSTODY of the court, and SURETY BOND has been posted, should the MAN file the NOTICE OF MISTAKE on the court file record?\nI would kindly appreciate any response, because that MAN is an IMAGINARY friend I have, and I would hate to have to play with him in IMAGINARY JAIL. Thank you!",
