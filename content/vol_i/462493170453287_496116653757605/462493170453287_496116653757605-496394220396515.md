   "message": "<<What LAW defines a VALID CONTRACT?>> THAT IS A PIVOTAL QUESTION! Its called CONTRACT LAW. And in order for there to be a VALID CONTRACT it MUST have certain elements. Some are mentioned by Scott, in his NOTICE OF MISTAKE (good stuff!) Some are: meeting of the minds, considerable or valuable consideration, intent to contract (CONSENT and FREE WILL of the parties), offer, acceptance, amoung others. A PARTY may claim there is a CONTRACT, but... Is it a VALID CONTRACT? And then again, BY WHICH AUTHORITY would CONTRACT LAW apply to the MAN?",
