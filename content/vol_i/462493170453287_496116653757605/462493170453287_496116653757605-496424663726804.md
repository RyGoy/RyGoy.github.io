   "message": "She got into HIS apartment without permission. She had found out he had cheated, and when he walked in the door, psyco-bitch mode was turned on, and she attacked him like a manic. He defended himself. The cops came, she lied saying HE attacked her first, he went to jail. After he comes out on BAIL, she confesses to Him, asked for forgivemess, and forgave each other. Now she tries to tell the prosecutor she forgave him, and she does not want to testify against him. Well, prostitutor subpoena her, to make sure she appears and they can $$$. Now, if SHE is the injured party, why is all of the sudden a 3rd party exercising AUTHORITy over the MEN to collect? They both would have to have a VALID CONTRACT with the STATE, agreen to solve this private matter amoungst MEN with the STATE, so the STATE can intervine. Is that so diffucult to comprehend? Something else, PROCEDURAL RIGHTS may make you waive SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS, so if he would want to go to trial, if there is LAW, that WOULD NOT be a venue to see matters of One of the People, with allegued Constitutional Rights, it must be in an Article III, section 2 venue, alleguedly. He would be waiving rights if he CONSENTS to be in that lower court, conforming to LAW. Now, THATS THE LAW. ;)",
