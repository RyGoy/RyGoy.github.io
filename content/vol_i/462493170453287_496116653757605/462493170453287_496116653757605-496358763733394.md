Yet, the question remains: BY WHICH AUTHORITY ANY MAN CAN APPLY the \"LAW\" to another MAN, lacking CONSENT? You are also asumming that I do not obey the LAW. I have NOT said that. I have just posted a question of LAW. And, I dont get offended if YOU call ME an idiot. I still LOVE YOU, Pierre. <3",
