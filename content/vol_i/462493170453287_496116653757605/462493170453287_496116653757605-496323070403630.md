   "message": "Is there is LAW, then everything is a CONTRACT. The LAW says a 3rd party has no business there, UNLESS THERE IS A CONTRACT between ALL PARTIES agreen to PROPER NOTICE given, considerable CONSIDERATION offered, and INTENT to CONTRACT, and all that good stuff the LAW says.. My question is: BY WHICH AUTHORITY ANY MAN CAN APPLY the \"LAW\" to another MAN, is there has not been any VALID CONTRACT AGREED by them? Slavery, anyone? Involuntary servitude? So you are BORNED and automatically the LAW of men applies to you, even without all the things a VALID CONTRACT MUST have are missing? BY WHICH AUTHORITY ANY MAN CAN APPLY the \"LAW\" to another MAN, is there has not been any VALID CONTRACT AGREED by them?",
