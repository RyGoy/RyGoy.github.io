   "message": "All the STATE has is a picture by email of an allegued affidavit with her allegued facts, pictures she sent by email on a later date of some brusses, and the police \"report\". That would ALL BE NON-ADMISSIBLE evidence in court, even according to the rules of evidence, if contested. Besides, an attorney CANNOT PRESENT EVIDENCE INTO THE CASE. Either he is a witness, or an attorney, but he can't be both. So, WHO would be presenting the evidence for this case?",
