   "message": "<<Dean Clifford talks about how in the Mead vs Mead that judge is just giving an opinion, it's irrelevant...>> ALL \"judges'\" orders/rulings are just opinions (to say the MOST), and are IN FACT JUST offers to CONTRACT; unlike  Scott, that has a VALID CONTRACT binding both PARTIES into an AGREEMENT, and you MUST then OBEY. ;) But, if there is no CONSENT to an AUTHORITY, you can DECLINE, or VOID that order/ruling/determination. Why not? If a stranger comes to you to try to enforce his LAWS on you, without CONSENT and a VALID CONTRACT, would not you send him to heck??? Where are your BALLS? Or OVARIES, if a woman, I guess.",
