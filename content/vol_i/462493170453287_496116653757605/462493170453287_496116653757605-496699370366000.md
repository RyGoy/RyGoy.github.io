   "message": "Ok. Lets make this even MORE interesting for some of the BONDED brains. I will make another CLAIM, and I ASSURE you no MAN could rebut it. I, a MAN, CLAIM DOMINION over all the living things on EARTH that are NOT other MEN. I also CLAIM DOMINION over all \"natural resources\". I CLAIM I will NOT rule over other MEN, and that I will share DOMINION ONLY with other MEN. Now, BY WHICH AUTHORITY, any other MAN, can rebut my CLAIM in LAW?",
