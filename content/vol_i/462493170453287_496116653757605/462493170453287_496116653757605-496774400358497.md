   "message": "When I say \"BELIEF IS EVIL\" I really mean it. This is why. It poses as \"knowledge\" and is given the same consideration as \"fact\", lest you \"offend\" somebody.\n\nBelief is the END of thought. It is NOT a virtue, and you are NOT a \"bad person\" for saying so.\n\nGive BELIEF all the ridicule and contempt it deserves. ALL of it.",
