   "message": "Lets remember, THERE IS NO FACTS BEFORE THE COURT YET. Its like if nothing has happened, at least allegedly in LAW its supposed to be that way. The only facts for the judge, and JURY (if there is a trial after this load of crap) to see is all these affidavits. Not good for the STATE, ISN'T? I mean, thats if you all BELIVE in LAW. :)",
