   "message": "We had a case here guy got beaten badly on the head.. (Irish drunken row) he ended up in coma for couple of weeks but luckily woke up....anyhow he forgave his abuser and ask the court not to punish him.. The case is still awaiting final decision but the abuser has been ordered to undergo probation report.. .interesting to say the least.. .Here in Ireland probation reports are ordered if the judge is confused on how to proceed with the case.. had one my self done very interesting indeed.",
