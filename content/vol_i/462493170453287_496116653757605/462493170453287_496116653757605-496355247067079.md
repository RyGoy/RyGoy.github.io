   "message": "Let me use Scott's example again. Scott signed a CONTRACT with THE CROWN, in form of an Oath and Affirmation to OBEY THE LAWS. Now Scott, I am positive, did this out of his OWN FREE WILL, and with CONSENT, there was a MEETING OF THE MINDS, there was CONSIDERATION, and all that goof stuff of CONTRACT LAW. So NOW we have PROOF that the LAW applies to JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN, and applies to THE CROWN as well, because there is a VALID CONTRACT between the 2 PARTIES. Now, anyone who HAS NOT done this in CANADA, how would you say that the LAW applies to the MAN in CANADA? BY WHICH AUTHORITHY?",
