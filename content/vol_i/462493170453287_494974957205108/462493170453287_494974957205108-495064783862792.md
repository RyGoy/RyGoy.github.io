   "message": "I asked a lawyer this past week- when would you use the term \"Point of order!\" in court?..he looked at me puzzled..didnt understand my question..\"Point of order is something that you would call during a BUSINESS MEETING,\" he said, not in court. This makes perfect sense after reading this why Scott says to call POINT OF ORDER right off-the-bat at the start of your BUSINESS MEETING in court! Thanks for all this, Max.....",
