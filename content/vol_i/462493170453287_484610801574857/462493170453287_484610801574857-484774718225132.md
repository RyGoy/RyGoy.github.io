   "message": "she asked me if i had had a bad experience with the police, i said is there a \"good\" experience with you? she said well if i was out of uniform you would not treat me like that (not that i was really all that disrespectful)i said no probably not , but you would not cost me 500 plus dollars in that case either... when she was handing her the tickets explaining the what to do's she had to point out a couple times that it was an arrestable offence...then tried to convince me that i should not judge police for the few bad apples, lol ya ok, you just took this woman's months grocery money right out of the family's mouth...no judging here, lol",
