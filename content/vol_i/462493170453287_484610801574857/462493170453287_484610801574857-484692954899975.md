   "message": "ha ha that's when all the fun is happening!....so far my classmates have me identifying accusers( the cop) and accused parties (the girl), injured party is of course absent, as there isn't one....so this being my first stab at this i want it to be a good one...if she writes NO CONTRACT and sends it registered mail, is this a viable option? and who is it sent to?
