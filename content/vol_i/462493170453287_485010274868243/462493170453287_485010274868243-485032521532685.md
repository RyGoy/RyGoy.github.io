   "message": "Derek. No I don't. I open the letter, if I don't like what I read I stuff it back in the envelope, seal it back up with clear tape. Mark it NCRTS and shove it in the nearest postbox.. No Stamp Required. Post office then stick it in an opaque bag, seal it and adress it and collect coin for delivering it. Another point not well known is that if your dealing with any form of government you can write OHMS (On Her Majestys Service) on your letter and it will go first class post for free. Probably work in Canada too?????",
