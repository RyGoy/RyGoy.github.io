   "message": "Hey Scott Duncan; Love this group and the wealth of information here is of incredible value IMO. But I have a couple questions with regards to things I am still a little unclear on.\n1. If I reserve all rights and say \"Barring any objection from the court\", does that statement not mean that the court cannot object, as it has been barred from doing so?\n2. If one needs only to operate in USD to satisfy the UCC; does this not mean that Canada has satisfied the UCC by trading oil in the world market?( Oil is traded internationally in USD according to world reserve currency)\n3. If I am in Court, and by using these methods I get the \"Justice\" to get up and walk out; does this not make me of the highest authority in the room; and give me the ability to dismiss the case myself and have the record reflect that?\n4. In asking the \"Justice\" \"who are you?\"; what would be the answer I would need from them that would prove they were a Crown Court Justice(appointed by the Crown, to which they have sworn an oath of service); thereby creating the grounds for recusal based on an obvious and ongoing conflict of interest?\nThank you again for your time and information; you are most certainly a bright light at the end of what seems to me to be a very long and dark tunnel; a tunnel leading out of the \"concentration camp\" we all call CANADA... ;)",
