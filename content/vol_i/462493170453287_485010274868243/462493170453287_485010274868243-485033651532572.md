   "message": "The summons I sent back was for telling a Train Ticket collecter to fuck off. He kicked me awake on the train. Anyway I'd read about a summons being an invitaion and that the reason you get arrested for failure to appear is that you tacitly agree to appear if you don't respond. So I thought I'd give my usual response and it worked. No warrent out for my arrest since I sent back the summons in 2010.",
