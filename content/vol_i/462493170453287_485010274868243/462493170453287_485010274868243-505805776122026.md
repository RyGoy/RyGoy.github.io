   "message": "oh and more strange brew brewing...while leaving county jail friday morning the pencil pushing administrative deputy deliberately lied to me about the date of the next hearing, he said, do you know you have court the 25 of April? I said is it really? he said yes. I knew court was the 22nd, so yesterday I called the court and the clerk said no hearing is schedule for case No. ______ today and I said are you sure with her on speaker so my witnesses could hear and she said no. I didn't believe them so I went to get the Register of Actions for the case No._____ and sure enough DEFENDANT FAILED TO APPEAR/BENCH WARRANT ISSUED/WARRANT REJECTED BY MICHIGAN STATE POLICE \"LEIN\" Law Enforcement Information Network. This is crazy they lied, they entered I failed to appear but the warrant was rejected from entering the police computers so when the Legal Name is ran it doesn't show in the system valid as of now, maybe it will be accepted at a later date but this time my bond is ten percent of 10,000.00 (1,000) if i dont pay i stay put lol.",
