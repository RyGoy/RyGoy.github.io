   "message": "Black's 6th:  De facto government. One that maintains itself by a\ndisplay of force against the will of the rightful legal\ngovernment and is successful, at least temporarily, in\noverturning the institutions of the rightful legal government\nby setting up its own in lieu thereof. \n\nDe facto judge. A judge who functions under color of\nauthority but whose authority is defective in some procedural\nform.\n\nDe jure: Descriptive of a condition in which\nthere has been total compliance with all requirements of\nlaw. Of right; legitimate; lawful; by right and just\ntitle. In this sense it is the contrary of de facto (q. v.). It\nmay also be contrasted with de gratia, in which case it\nmeans \"as a matter of right,\" as de gratia means \"by\ngrace or favor.\"\n\nSo, from what Derek Moran was informed:'\"Derek, Essentially all courts in Ontario are de jure courts, or law abiding courts.\", means that when I become recognised as a belligerent, the court then becomes a de jure court?",
