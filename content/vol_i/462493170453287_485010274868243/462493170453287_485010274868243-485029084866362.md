   "message": "I been using \"No Contract, Return to Sender\" on the outside of envelopes for more than 2 years. At least 3 speed camera and two traffic signal tickets and one summons. All these have gone away. One Police deptartment wrote back with a threat letter which they also got back \"No Contract\" The best thing is our post office bag up resealed envelopes and charge about ï¿½3.00 to deliver them back CASH on DELIVERY so imagine the Tea & Biscuit Fund Tin gets robbed everytime Hahahaha",
