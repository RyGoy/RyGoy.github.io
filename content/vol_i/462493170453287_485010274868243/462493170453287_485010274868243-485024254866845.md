   "message": "Last time I was in Majestrates (provincial) I refused to stand as they entered. Right off the bat he was screaming at me. I had worded my response so as not to create controversy and risk 'contempt'. I said \"I'm happy to stand up upon reciept of proof of claim that you have authority over me.\" This went down before the name game. They all walked out. They came back and all sat down. Addressed me as \"Mr Rawlingson\" I said \"There is no Mr Rawlingson here, Mr Rawlingson is on the clerk's desk\" (whilst out the room I passed my BC to the usher to give the clerk.) I now realise this was a big mistake but it did lead to a very interesting hearing where I got to have my say, my way. Ripped 3 cops storys apart, exploded the evidence and still got a guilty. Better luck next time eh.",
