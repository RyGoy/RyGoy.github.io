   "message": "David, some nice points.  But you must be aware of the jurisdiction of the court you are in.  If the jurisdiction of the court is solely statutory, no appealing to the administrator will help.  His only authority is statutory.  He cannot hear anything else.  And you most definitely cannot invoke a common law court in a court that is only authorized to hear statutory matters.",
