   "message": "Hmm, I have the balls to do it no problem.  What is the difference if you take a cop or crown into their court or you put a lein on their property, you are still open to retribution!  Honestly when my buddy got into it with the crown outside of the court room,the guy RAN like a little bitch!  I have observed one thing and I have been in court many times, they are more afraid of you than you should be of them, snakes are like that!!!  If the statutes apply to them, then I say apply them. Scott the tickets are FREE and so am I!!!",
