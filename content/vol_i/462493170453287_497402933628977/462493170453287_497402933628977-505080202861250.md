   "message": "I've spent 30 days in the dunk tank for contempt because i know made a few mistakes; that's the only way to end up there..traffic court is easy but the county district court seems tougher; they put on more pressure, they gang up on you real quick, even the public pretender defenders got involved yelling out in court from behind me, it was an all out assault and now they want to force a public pretender on my case, i need to figure out to block it and start fresh, court is scheduled Monday again.",
