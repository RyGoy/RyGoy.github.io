   "message": "doing anything wrong makes people look like idiots and wackos to these public crooks and since we have all the enlightenment taking place about the corruption going on it seems it has produced a lot of idiots in the way, making it look bad upon others and im not trying to be in that category, when i take the steps i want to take some good steps forward that make sense and are logical. Some people just throw out heaps of shit and look insane however i don't blame them for the trial and error which gains experience, its just how will you really know what works when you throw at em everything possible to get a positive result.",
