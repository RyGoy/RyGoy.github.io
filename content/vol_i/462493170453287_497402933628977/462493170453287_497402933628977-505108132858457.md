   "message": "Derek Moran when he asked that question i stated \"i demand the case be terminated\" he remained silent for a few seconds ignored that move and then brought up other issues, then that's when I then i asked questions about the complaint, its like he couldn't hear my demand for some reason, maybe i should of said discharge; i was testing the non motion, non dismiss angle really, I wasn't scared of contempt although i lost ten pounds for the food being nutritious near the brink of starvation.",
