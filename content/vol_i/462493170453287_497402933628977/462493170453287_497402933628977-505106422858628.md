MASTERS QUESTION, SLAVES ANSWER. For instance if a \"justice\" said anything except \"I agree. Case dismissed,\" you question why they are even speaking. \"I'm sure you'll recall Mr. (insert justice's name here) that at the beginning of these proceedings I explicitly reserved all rights, including yours. Have I not made my wishes clear?\"",
