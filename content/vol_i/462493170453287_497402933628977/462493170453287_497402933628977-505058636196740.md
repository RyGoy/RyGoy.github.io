   "message": "this is happening to me right now in the STATE OF MICHIGAN; a police and prosecutor conspiracy; they have no victims, no witnesses, only a complaining witness who is a special resources officer that didn't see shit nor have any involvement and probably strips on a stage at night...the case is misdemeanor and based on reasonable cause ok but the judge found probable cause to order a warrant, sound right? i think not....its a scam to waste time and pressure a guilty plea but i want to get it thrown out immediately. its been difficult.",
