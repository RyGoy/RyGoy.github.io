   "message": "Yes, that is my plan I will go this week and give them to the crown, try to get one in the court file. Although here the clerks \"say\" they give them to the judge, which is bullshit because if the Judge got it he would have to recuse himself, I believe.  So I will go to the Judges offices and be sure he gets one.  I have had a few Judges recuse themselves already.  If anything, wasting their time equals wasting their money also!!  There is more than one way to skin a skin a cat/snake! Thanks for the advice!!",
