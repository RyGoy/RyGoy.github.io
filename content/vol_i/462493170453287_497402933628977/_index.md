   "message": "Just wondering, if you are charge with a \"crime\" that is statutory in nature, why don't you bring a charge against the police or crown in their court, that's what it's there for, employees of the government.  For example, someone on this page had said that their family and or witnesses were not allowed in court. At that point why would you go to see the Justice of the peace and lay a charge of obstruction.  At a court hearing I was at, a buddy who has some knowledge of this type of stuff got into an argument with the crown, both in and outside of the court room.  He went to the JP and had a peace bond taken out against the crown, simple!  Of course there was no financial compensation at that point, but it is using their words (criminal code) against them, like the do to us!  Simple or not?  I am considering charging the crown with conspiracy in my case, they have CONspired with the police to do harm to me.  Just putting it out there! Any comments?",
