   "message": "It's only stupid if a) a train is comming and b) if you don't want to die.  I suspect that all of this comes down to power, if the Justice or Justice of the Peace, perceives that you are more powerful (spiritually speaking) then they are you win. It cannot just be about paper and what's written on it, it's the delivery!  These people in the \"justice system\" know they have to walk out on the street, they don't live in the Ivory tower called the court house.  I ran into the Judge who sentenced me in the grocery store one day, he literally froze in his footsteps, I just walked by pretending not to notice him.  If I had said boo, he would have crapped his pants. I have no fear (ego) or anything to lose. According to Janis Joplin, that's my friend is FREEDOM!!",
