   "message": "Scott Duncan: \"Out of dodge\" = Location's designation is \"ZETA Aquilae\".\n\nYou need boats to get there. It's not something that is public.\nEven people who lived with and studied under me do not know its location.\n\nZETA AQUILAE is the name of a server, as far as people like Andrew Langevin, and the like, know.\n\nIt will also take a LONG time to get there, and I don't want to be underway when war breaks out. I want to be settled in and lounging by the time THAT happens.\n\nWe all did out best. We tried for 25 years to warn ALL of you, and for what?\n\nAll I got out of it was:\n\nA dead child.\n\nGuns stuck in my face and removal from/of my home, and \"what are you gonna do about it\" as remedy.\n\nFailed students, who now declare \"it was all them\" and I was just \"incidental\".\n\n...and all sorts of nasty descriptions regarding my character.\n\nSo I'm liquidating and leaving. I shall sit back, surround myself with those who have EARNED my TRUST, and we will all watch the spectacular ass-kicking you've all got coming.\n\nThat's all that's left.",
