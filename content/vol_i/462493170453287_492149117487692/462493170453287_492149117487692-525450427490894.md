   "message": "Scott Duncan: There is only one signature on newly issued \"Birth certificates\" and the new plastic bills only have BANK OF CANADA trustees signing (Nobody from the government, like a treasurer).\n\nThis is not \"your money\" anymore and will help facilitate the \"North American Union\" that's coming.\n\nTHE U.S. has no value and nobody is buying their debt anymore.
