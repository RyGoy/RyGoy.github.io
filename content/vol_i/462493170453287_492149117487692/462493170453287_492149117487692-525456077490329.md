   "message": "Scott Duncan: You love the matrix (belief) too much.\n\nDon't beat yourself up though. The majority is like that.\n\nChad Brodgesell, if you trust a systems engineer about a computer, because of their KNOWLEDGE and EXPERIENCE, and they tell you that something you \"BELIEVE\" about a computer is wrong...you don't stand by \"belief\" when the Systems Engineer says you need to get the computer working! Expecially if it's NEEDED to run the point defence system of the loction the \"believer\" is at.\n\nThat is just ONE example.\n\nClinging to \"belief\" that contradicts reality, EVEN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE REALITY, is toxic. There is no hostile intent. Belief is EVIL. I will never abide it. EVER.",
