   "message": "My take Philip Laforet, is that, by not granting jurisdiction, by disassociating yourself from being the name (notice of mistake) & other means outlined through your 'point of order' & reserving all rights, you have effectively/deliberately/inadvertently demonstrated your sovereignty...\n\nThe court will (after repeated challenges/threats/ignoring you etc) recognise this & refer to you as being (a)'belligerent':\n\nnot the common everyday adjective 'hostile & ignorant', \n\nbut the noun meaning:\n\n'A nation or person engaged in war or conflict, as recognized by international law'....(this is an online dictionary definition because I don't have Black's at hand, but Black's is very specific about the adjective & its relevance in law).\n\nYou then ask 'By what authority do you wage war against my person?'\n\nWhen you look up 'war' and 'wage war', again there are specific references to a requirement for a head of state (I think- talking from memory here) to declare war (written signed order) before anyone has any authority to wage an attack against your person...ie: the court, the judge/justice, the plaintiff etc do not have any authority because war has not been formally declared against your nation/person.\n\nRules of evidence (apparently, because I haven't verified this for Australia/UK where I spend most of my time), require that this merry-go-round goes round 3 times & as long as you continue to demonstrate that you are not surety & you maintain your sovereignty & don't grant jurisdiction, the court finally accepts that they are the administrators/trustees to the account/name, and you, the sovereign man are invited to go & have a nice day (or words to that effect ;-)\n\nBut as always, read the threads numerous times, define any and ALL terms you are unclear on, see if I get a kicking for talking out my ass, or if it's liked/confirmed by the brainstrust, and just as your brain starts to fry, it will become clearer...and then clarify grey areas with the oracle :-)  (brainstrust & oracle being terms for Scott Duncan )",
