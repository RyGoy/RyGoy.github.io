   "message": "Derek Moran, I have found it very interesting, as you say, that congress didn't declare war against [insert just about any country name here]...but the chief executive/president, 'W', HAS declared war on terror/drugs/poverty, at least in the media...In my thinking, this then becomes a sneaky legalese play on words that theoretically allows/justifies the US forces to pursue the terror, drugs etc all over the globe, without the need to legally declare a war against a country, nation, group or people because they have declared war against a concept.",
