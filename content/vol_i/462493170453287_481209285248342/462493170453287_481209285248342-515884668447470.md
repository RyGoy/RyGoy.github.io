   "message": "I see the term \"BELLIGERENT DEFENDANT\"  as a ploy to cause an emotional response which was programmed in that most comprehend it to mean \"stupid\"  The courts, cops, agents of government will use these tricks to gain jurisdictional authority. this thous CONjoins the \"PERSON\" with the \"man\"    My suggestion is this. look up words you think you know don't just assume you know for sure. Common English tends to mislead us in our endeavor when we seek freedom. YOU can either allow this to continue or break free.",
