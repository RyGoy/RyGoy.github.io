   "message": "It's SO hard to say this without sounding condescending, so I apologize in advance!\n\nI'm proud of you. You are BETTER than your peers, and you make a REAL difference. Time will surely show this to be true.\n\nWhile you observe Mr.  Leblond's reactions, you already know you are on the RIGHT side.\n\nYou can't be on the RIGHT side, unless you think right, and value the right things (or implicitly trust someone who does). It's a burden, but it's worth it. You are now more than you were. The possibilities are ENDLESS.",
