   "message": "My reference was to 'the' person solely because of John's comment re a  declaration of war...I want to know by what authority the court has declared such a war...ie: Who authorised it?  I think the head of state is the only party who can legally declare war, so if there is no formal declaration of war, by what authority is the justice declaring war against a belligerent/sovereign? ;-)",
