   "message": "It was beyond their comprehension that someone would study law, and NOT become a lawyer.\n\nAs I said before; NOBODY drops out of law school because it's \"hard\". It isn't. It's memory and recitation. The whole myth about \"Law degrees are so hard to get\", is a myth PAID FOR by the Law Society.\n\nEver notice that EVERY lawyer you meet is stupid? HOW? How can they be stupid? Don't you have to be \"smart\" to get a law degree?\n\nNO!\n\nIn fact it's SO easy I studied computer science and medicine too! \n\nYou paid for it, too! :D",
