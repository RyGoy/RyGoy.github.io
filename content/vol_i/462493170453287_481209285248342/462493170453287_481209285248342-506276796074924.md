   "message": "Hi scott, sorry this might be late. But ive been busy.\n\nim trying to grasp the meaning of belligerent and tis connection with sovereignty.\n\nmy understanding of belligerent is a hostile act or intention towards another group/nation. Would they be accepting you as someone who is hostile or trying to get you to accept being hostile?\n\nWhen i look it up it makes alot of references to waging war. I somewhat understand why you always say or ask if they are waging war against you, but i dont fully understand the connection between them agreeing you as sovereign.\n\nThey \"may\" refer to you as a nation or an entity, but as sovereign?\n\nSomeone be so kind to help me figure this out?",
