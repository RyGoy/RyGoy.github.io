   "message": "k thats nice and dandy,. but my example was about getting arrested before doing anything.\n\nScott, its a bit unclear what your trying to get me/us to see by wage war.\n\nMy best guess is that in order to wage war you must have your own currency and that comes with its own nation. Therefor with that in mind you are capable of waging war. And thus since a nation can only wage war if sovereign, that indorectly states you are in fact sovereign?",
