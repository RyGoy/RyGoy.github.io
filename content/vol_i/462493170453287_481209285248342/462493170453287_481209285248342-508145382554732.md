   "message": "Wow thanks so much Stuart!  I am in the middle of a court case now and I did use the notice of mistake and the point of order.  I was removed fromthe courtroom once.  I was in \"custody\" and wanted to get out, so I didn't push it too hard.  They had sent an out of town J.P. and crown plus an expert bail cop.  I still won, but had to sign recog.  Now that I am out, I am more determined to get things straighten out and declare my status.  Actually can't wait. Thanks again for clearing this up for me.  With so many comments and some off topic it is difficult sometimes to get to the bottom of things!  All the best!",
