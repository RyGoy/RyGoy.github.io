   "message": "Kate Butler's Statistically Significant Other (She spends all her time with him) is pretty hard-core. I can move at a decent speed with him, but he's like a Lithium Battery; Full power and then without warning...done.\n\nIt takes about 4 hours to wear him down, and he knows more than everyone here combined.
