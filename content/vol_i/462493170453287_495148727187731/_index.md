   "message": "Scott mentioned at one time that in Canada we don't have a sitting government since it was prorogued back in 2008...which coincidentally it was in 2009 when the Government of Canada was rebranded to \"Harper Government\"...is this all related? I'm having trouble finding the procedures for resuming government after proroguing it, can anyone direct me in the right direction?",
