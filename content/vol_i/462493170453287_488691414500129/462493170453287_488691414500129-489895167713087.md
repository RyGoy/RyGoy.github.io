   "message": "Rick, the courts will not hear you at this point, you are in dishonour and as far as I know, there is no turning back. The house is gone; I would learn and move on. Let me elaborate�\nRick likes house, makes offer on house.\nRick enters contract with bank which allows him to close on the purchase contract and move into house.\nRick has fun in house. Many women are fucked and much beers and weed is consumed. Rick has a lot of fun in said house.\nRick has a little too much fun and forgets his contractual obligation with the bank to make his mortgage payment.\nThe bank sends a friendly letter reminding Rick to make his payment.\nRick ignores the letter.\nThe bank sends 2 or 3 more letters.\nRick ignores the letters.\nThe bank sends NOTICE and warns Rick they are going to foreclose and COLLECT the COLLATERAL if he does not make good on his PROMISE to pay.\nRick ignores the NOTICE, ignores the court appearance; dishonours himself.\nBank goes to court UNCHALLENGED, get judgement in their favour. Rick breached a contract; the COLLATERAL must be COLLECTED.\nRick does ignores that he is NO LONGER OWNER of the house\nBank lists the property on the MLS with a realtor with the CROWN as SELLER\nRick ignores that the house he thinks he still owns is for sale.\nAnother realtor brings a buyer along who likes Rick�s house and writes an offer SUBJECT to financing.\nRick ignores that his house is PENDING under a NEW and VALID CONTRACT\nSeveral days go by and the new BUYER removes his conditions. The home is no longer PENDING SALE. All that is required at this point is for the judge to say �done deal!�\nRicks pulls his head out of the sand and says �hey! You can�t do that, that�s my house!�\nCourt does not hear Rick because he is not even part of the equation anymore. He breached a contract, agreed to the JURISDICTION by not showing up. In the courts eyes, he is insane. He agreed for the COLLATERAL to be claimed and is now saying he owns the house.\nRick is lucky they didn�t send him away for a psychological assessment.\nThis is what happened. You can give all the notices you want, the judge will not REVERSE the initial judgement awarded to the bank. Should you have shown up at the first court session, you might have had a chance, although highly unlikely. The judges are there to PROTECT the SYSTEM (scam). Don�t expect to penetrate the wall of bullshit they put up. The wall is thick and high. \nBend over, smile and try not to scream too loud when they stick it in�",
