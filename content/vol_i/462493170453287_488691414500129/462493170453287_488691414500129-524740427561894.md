   "message": "(Scott clicked 'Like' on this): Derek Moran: When i brought up to my paralegal-instructor this past week who is a lawyer about Prerogative Writs, he admitted to me that he had forgotten about those cuz itd been awhile since he had ever done one, but he did admit that \"you are talking about common law Writs.\" He thought i was asking him about Civil writs which were/are the ones you are talking about i believe Fiona- WRIT OF POSSESSION. I could tell he was quite surprised that i even knew about Prerogative writs at all and further surprised as i listed off all 5 of them as he could only remember two. I think you need to declare to the court that you are not there IN PERSONAM, but, that you are there IN REM. IN PERSONAM = agree to the jurisdiction.. IN REM = you are there to protect/defend a right 'against the world,' which would entail that Maxim that no one shall be dragged from their house, an inviolable right which is even entrenched in the Constituition of IRELAND - me lucky charms!",
