   "message": "New thread regarding 'MY home...'\n\nScott (or anyone more well-informed than I). \n\nI am currently heading to Kelowna for court tomorrow to attempt to stop the sale of my house by the bank. They are petitioning the courts for the sale at 9:45. I Served them notice that I do not consent to the sale and did not receive PROPER NOTICE regarding the contract and require FULL DISCLOSURE as to whom the parties in the contract are, whom put forth the required CONSIDERATION.\n\nThere is more and I can post the full notice if you like. I am mainly just concerned that I have done this properly and what can or should I expect. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",
