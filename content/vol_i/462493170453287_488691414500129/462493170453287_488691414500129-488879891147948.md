   "message": "From previous readings elsewhere:  What parties to the contract risked anything? (only you, because the bank have not provided any valuable consideration to the transaction)...If the bank claim they have risked anything/funds, demand that they show the origin of the funds via Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of double entry bookkeeping which will show who the grantor was (ie: you in a different status)...Ask for a stay in proceedings to allow them time to come forward with this information.  I hope that's useful & this post wasn't too late.",
