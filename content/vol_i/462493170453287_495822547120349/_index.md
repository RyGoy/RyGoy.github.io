   "message": "Had a visit today from a \"policy\" man. Someone called to complain about someone riding an atv through the trailer park around the corner from me, (may or may not have been an offspring of mine) in any case I asked if there was any damage to the \"complainant's\" property, as I would not stand for that...no reply to that. He asked if I owned a white atv, I said yes, he said, can I have your name? I said, no...he said, you won't give me your name? I said, why would I do that? he said, cuz you own the atv...I said, so what, do you have any ID? he said, yes (but didn't produce any) I asked again if there was any damage reported, and what was the crime? he then said (and even wrote it down and gave me his word) that if he could find an offence to charge me under he would...quoted from the little note I have from him: \"If there are charges to be laid regarding this atv complaint, I will be laying the charge\" signed plc blah blah....I asked what I would be charged under exactly, but he said \"you'll see\" lol (apparently we are in grade three) I said so this is what you are about \"looking\" for an offence to charge someone, because I was uncooperative? again he gave me his word he would be looking for the offence to charge me with ....he wouldn't hang around despite me trying to get answers to my questions, but wanted me to answer his...I could be the bad guy here but I suppose we'll see...he did come back long enough to get the plate number off my truck 10 mins later...don't think I made a friend today.",
