No Sky Daddies. No \"God's law\", just the truth. You don't know who you are. If you don't find out, some stranger you will never meet will decide for you.\n\nNo figure out WHY WE'RE RIGHT. \"IF we are right, isn't even a question.\n\nI'm one of the \"bad guys\" who the bad guys didn't want. Remember that.\n\nI tell you the truth, because I have to. Maa Nathltaapaan because he needs to. Different motives; SAME TRUTH",
