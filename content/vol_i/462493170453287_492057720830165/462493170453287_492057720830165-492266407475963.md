   "message": "When the \"justice\" starts speaking, interrupt them. Say, \"Point of order!\" They will immediately be silent. At that point, state \"I believe I am the only party with standing, so barring objection from the court, I wish to RESERVE ALL RIGHTS now, and henceforth. Are there any objections from the court?\" As the court has no standing to respond, simply speak to the record as such, \"Let the record show that I have reserved all rights, and the court has not objected.\" At this point if they say anything to you, you simply say, \"Objection. The record shows that I have reserved all rights, and I have not granted you leave to speak. Why are you speaking?\"",
