   "message": "Let's zoom back to the present (so we can get as far away from belief as possible) where the word \"YOU\" is part of the English language, as are the titles, \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", and \"Mrs.\". All of these titles and means of addressing you, are in fact, assigning and/or presuming SURETY...yes, on YOU. The easiest mnemonic exercise you can do to make deflecting these titles second nature is to replace the titles \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", or \"Mrs.\" with the word, \"bitch\", in your head; and to respond as if they had addressed you as \"bitch\", because being addressed as \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", or \"Mrs.\" is doing exactly that.",
