   "message": "David I hope all goes well.  And i have much admiration for people in this movement.  But even if your fee schedule is lawful, which I am not so sure, how exactly would you go about enforcing it? Are you expecting a government cheque after giving the cop your fee schedule?  I am not aware of a single person who has had such a contract enforced and received money from the state, are you?  Again, I emphasize that people get all pumped with these concepts but have little to no idea how to effect them, that is assuming they are valid in the first place.  I cannot overemphasize enough the necessity for parties to know ALL THE DETAILS required to see these  concepts through to the end to the point where they obtain a court order for your gold or whatever.  And if someone says you can right your own order and have it enforced, well, I have yet to see that first hand and no one claiming such things has ponied up evidence of such things.  So what should common sense then tell you?",
