   "message": "first I don't profess to know anything....it just occurred to me as I read yours and Pierre's convo...that in law...between men and women, men have the \"king\" potential...women don't....if the question relates to who should have custody of a child...even though a child needs both parents love and contribution while growing(from a non legal perspective)...I'm thinking from a state/legal perspective...the law doesn't really care...and to give custody to the mother (considered property..if not to a husband then to the state?) it would be in the states best interest from a control position to give the child to the mother. I am not saying I agree with this perspective at all, just throwing it out there for discussion.",
