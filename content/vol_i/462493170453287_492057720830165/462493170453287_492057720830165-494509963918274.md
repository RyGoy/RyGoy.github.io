   "message": "the district court has the state seal on the wall up overhead where the judge sits, and the state flag to the right and the gold fringed gold tassled eagle topped U.S. flag to the left. so it's U.S. Admiralty jurisdiction concurrent with State as identified. entering the court is notice by the flag of the jurisdiction...
