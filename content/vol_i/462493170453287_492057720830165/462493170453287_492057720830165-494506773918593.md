   "message": "James Allan in massachusetts district court they have a roll call twice before they actually have a judge come in and sit while they call the cases. when you arrive you are supposed to sign in at probation that you are there, and then 2 roll calls, sometimes a lawyer will ask to be put on second call. if one waits till they call the complaint, they have allready acknowledged surety for the name. isnt it then to late to argue that point?",
