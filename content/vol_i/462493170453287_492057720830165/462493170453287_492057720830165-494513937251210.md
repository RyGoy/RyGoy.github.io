   "message": "Yes, they basically do the same here, but make you plead. If you just say you would prefer to handle this matter they will automatically set a court date as you've plead \"not guilty\". You cannot \"file\" anything until this pleading bit goes on as there is no file. I faxed my stuff in long before that part went on and they got it apparently. Add on something like, \"If anything here should be rebutted, please reply within 14 days.\" Then send a notice of default if they haven't.",
