   "message": "Nope, I don't mind paying for a govt issued ID as license. Small price to pay rather than taking the path of friction... I need to get home at the end of the day and feed the bratty she-devil I bore instead of losing my vehicle and walking home... Those hassles cost more time and money than a stupid ID. I have no SIN number on any accounts.",
