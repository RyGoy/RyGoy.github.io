   "message": "I hate the argument that using legal tender does not bind you.  For instance if i am in china amd use chinese currency to involve myself in an act deemed illegal by chinese jurisdiction and i am caught in said act no amount of freedom nonsense will help the situation.  The same goes for any fucking jurisdiction where the threat of violence is in use.  No argumwnt will prevent you from being \"charged\".",
