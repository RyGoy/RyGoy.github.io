   "message": "theres an old saying that goes \"Don't Question KIngs\". more or less the whole idea behind a Republic form of government everyone is Master of Self under the Divine Order of the Natural Realm...in the dialogues of Plato I figure the reasons for all the questioning in their culture is nobody wanted to be the slave depending on another mans knowledge...A.
