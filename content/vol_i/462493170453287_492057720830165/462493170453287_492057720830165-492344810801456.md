   "message": "So Scott- say i want to take the City to a Court of Equity to get a writ-of-Certiorari or Mandamus ordered and enforced, but ive only ever been told i have to initiate the action by submitting a NOTICE OF APPLICATION...if APPLICATION automatically creates surety/joinder to the court's jurisdiction what would you use to initiate this proceeding then. OR.. since it is a Court of Equity you're seeking to begin with, does it even MATTER if you create joinder since that is the jurisdiction you wanted to be in in the first place, by submitting NOTICE OF APPLICATION for it?",
