   "message": "have any of you heard of Haudenosaunee? The role of man and woman is very interesting. Pierre mentions woman having \"more power\". ALWAYS remember more power=more responsibility. Although i don't think ANYONE should be in a \"more power\" position, the Huadenosaunee have a very unique perspective on how \"power\" or actions are carried out.",
