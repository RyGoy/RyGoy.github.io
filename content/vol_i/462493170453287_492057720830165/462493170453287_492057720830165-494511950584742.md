   "message": "nope, you dont even get to plead. they 'arraign' you. they say, Mr so&so, you have been charged with... \"a not guilty plea will be entered on your behalf\", and you get a date to return.\n\nwhen i heard that i immediately objected, the judge looks at the clerk-magistrate (probably never heard anyone object before), they said Mr, Johansen.... and I said I have no idea whats going on i dont even know why i'm here...\n\nthat was my case last january i havent ever brought up here for you'sall to have a field day with. needless to say it is how they operate the kangaroo court. of 4 charges i had 3 dismissed and paid the speeding ticket. half the $ for the ticket went to the town that arrested me, and IMHO it's fraud. they employ police to generate revenue, but a 'citizen' slave has no right to complain...",
