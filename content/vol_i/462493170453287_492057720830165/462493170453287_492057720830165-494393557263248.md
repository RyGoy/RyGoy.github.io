   "message": "Thanks for dumbing it down for me, nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk :$    Okay, here is my point, there are all sorts of theories out there.  And they may very well be great.  I hear talk of praecipes, motions, liening,  petitions and on and on, but I see no practical examples of them or first hand illustrations of their success (or failure).  A great theory absent the details on how to execute it and give it effect is about as useful as a fighter jet without a pilot - all it does is make a good conversation piece and uselessly takes up space.  Common sense should dictate that the proof is in the pudding.",
