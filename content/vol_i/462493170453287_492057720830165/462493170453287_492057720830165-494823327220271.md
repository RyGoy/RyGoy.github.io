   "message": "oh, james, that's simple, you lien their property and then offer that lien at 50 cents on the dollar to a bank or to the highest bidder. the bank's greed should be enough to get them to buy the note. it's simply using their own trick against them, that and the greed of man. worst case is the lien has to be satisfied upon the sale of the title/deed liened. and it can be either sold or willed to my nieces, so they who outlives me will collect eventually.",
