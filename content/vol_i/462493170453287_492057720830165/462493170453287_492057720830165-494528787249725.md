   "message": "@beverly, right, see as soon as i can get this name issue resolved, do the inc. (but that is a government benefit thou, who licenses those?) then the trust, then the lien against the birth certificate & it's associated investment account with fidelity (i've allready found that account), discharge the fiduciary, and claim/demand return from the thieft of $3M (cumeulative sinse 62) plus expenses... should probably be worth 200M by now. then i can use that to build the electric auto factory and put a few thousand local people to work, provide them benefits to raise families, and sign them all up as members of the trust.\n\nthen when I die, the company will be self sufficient and owner operated, it's own finance, health, everything. and if somone bombs it oh well, they will have to rebuild...\n\nwhat could be more noble than saving thousands of americans by employing them at what they would like, and providing them with really cool electric automobiles, backyard gardens, & home fuel/sanitation refineries.",
