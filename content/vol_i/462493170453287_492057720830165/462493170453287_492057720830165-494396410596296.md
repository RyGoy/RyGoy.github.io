   "message": "James- i hear what you're saying. I was listening to a lawyer last night tell me you have 2 choices: STATEMENT OF CLAIM for an action, or 'the alternative' a NOTICE OF APPLICATION to get a judge to make and enforce an order. I knew that he was wrong in naming it a Notice of APPLICATION from reading Scott's writings; i just dont know what we are supposed to replace APPLICATION with in a NOTICE OF APPLICATION..... Scott, im suspecting i would re-name it a NOTICE OF PRAECIPE? :/",
