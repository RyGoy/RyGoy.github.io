   "message": "@ Scott Earlier you wrote \"You are still bound by the oath.\" If the GUY IN THE BLACK DRESS is bound, why can the court decide if it wants to ADMIT (into the court) anything you/I/we put it/them on NOTICE for? When I started reading your wiki link I started giggling and almost peed myself with happiness cause I was thinking I really am starting to get your/the message, then the smile fell of my face when I read the second last sentence of the first paragraph which states: \"The decision on whether to admit the information lies at the discretion of the court.\" The last sentence is curious as well. Itgot me trying to think clearly as I could. It states \"The phrase amicus curiae is legal Latin.\"  I am wondering (wheels spinning) as well, if the court gets to decide to admit or deny us and our offerings, is it because, much like a motion, when we use their language, such as \"amicus curiae\", (without ourselves providing a defininition as to it's exact meaning), we ENTER their \"legal Latin\" world which they have jurisdiction over what they admit or deny? In other words (pardon the pun) if we use their phrase or term \"amicus curiae\", do they get to admit or deny because , much like an APPLICATION AND/OR  MOTION, we are using their law forms and symbols. ie: Use and their form of appearing \"amicus curiae\" and as is the case with a MOTION AND/OR APPLICATION they get jurisdiction over your forms and your POSITION/STATUS in the MATTER before the COURT.
