   "message": "so then after handing the officer the papers, if he faults, the corporation can file a suit against the corporation he is agent for aswell as him privately, and ruin him.\n\ni have seen where someone filed a lien against a police officers home. and as i understand it a lien can be transferred (sold). so this avenue is a potential source of income for me and my heirs.\n\nyes, fee schedule. have you filed your NUI&COR plus the fee schedule with the secretary of state, so when they violate you you have a value specified to sue them or any agent for? my fee to the government for anything, especially any unlawful detainment is one ounce troy of pure 9,999 gold (AU) per hour. note the state can only coin gold or silver as currency, it's in THEIR constitution. neither of which creates joinder, but that also leaves open the possibility of the notice and fee schedule doing such, but the choice is theirs to entertain the contract, i merely make it optional for acceptance.\n\nso you guys are pretty smart, i'll give you that but you have a whole lot available picture to take in. you can sue them as a corporation who enjoined in a contract (by the act of the agent), send them the bill, and sue them in court for non payment and lien the F out of THEM...",
