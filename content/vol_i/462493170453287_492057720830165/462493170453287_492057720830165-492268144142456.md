   "message": "As for the word \"YOU\", think of that as a tennis ball which must be served back. Assert your AUTHORITY by questioning whenever they address you as \"YOU\"; \"Are YOU addressing ME?\" If they're stupid enough to say yes, or even to imply the affirmative,  demand proof; \"By what authority do YOU address me as a PARTY OF SURETY?\"...or something along those lines. Your only objective is to serve the \"YOU\" back to them.\n\nSo that's today's word, \"SURETY\". It's something you don't want, and I've just shown you how to give it back.",
