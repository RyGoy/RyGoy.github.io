   "message": "Scott, respectively, that doesn't answer the question.  I see a lot of people offering very vague positions with no specifics on how to go about achieving the ends.  One could easily say the goal is to win not to lose.  Well of course!  As far as I can see there is nothing in the rules that permits an intiating process much other than an application or a statement of claim with some small variances thereto.  Do you have another way that works?  If so, how specifically do you implement it?  If its outside the Court, then where does it go and what exactly is it?",
