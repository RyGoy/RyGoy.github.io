   "message": "a parking ticket has a fee schedule on its reverse along with instructions. when i brought them the ticket like it requests, i photo copied it seeing as it itself is just a copy and not the original, and applied my own fee schedule on the reverse, which the parking clerk cop that reviewed that ticket's rebuttal accepted by default when i handed it to him. it said, talking to or listening to any government agent will result in acceptance of the fee schedule of $1000 per hour inclusive of all time in between the initiation of and settlement theirof. so if he hadnt voided the ticket, and it went to court, from the time i handed it to him till they resolved the issue i had a rightful claim to a thousand dollars per hour between the initiated time and the conclusion, which could have been weeks, and that's 168 thousand dollars per week. could have easily run into half a million i could have sued the state and that officer for. the notice was irrelevent of the result of the parking ticket.\n\ntalk about ruining someones day who just thought they were doing their job.",
