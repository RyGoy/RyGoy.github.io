   "message": "David Johansen, freedom must be earned.  It wont be handed to you.  In theory, yes what you say is true.  But we must operate in reality and practicality.  Presenting the notice of mistake et al will most likely not work and they will proceed to convert your designation and issue tickets and summons and tell you you can take it up in court.  But the facts that you establish at the scene may be a stepping stone to becoming free depending on what you do with them and where you do it.",
