   "message": "If I may, Pierre, I think you've made the same mistake I did, which is to engage the court process as a plaintiff, who has all the burden of proof on his shoulders. Knowing what I now know, thanks to Scott, I'm contemplating reversing my position by placing liens on the corporation as well as the owner of said corporation -  for the money that is owned to me. I suppose that might \"motivate\" them to file a claim against me (to remove the liens) which I could latter motion (?) the court to \"join\" the two claims together as they are tied hand in hand in every aspect. Would that not \"force\" the other party to the suit into some type of action?",
