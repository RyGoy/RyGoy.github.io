   "message": "i wonder if a writ would be better to use to stop the court in all matters pertaining to the case you started rather than a notice of mistake. I presume you made the claim thru the NAME. But can the court not be ordered by Pierre Daoust in regards to the claim made thru the NAME? Command the court to refrain from all proceedings using the \"point of order\" when the NAME is called.",
