   "message": "One thing i recently noticed with our new plastic money. On the old PAPER money, on the front of it, on the left-hand-side, on that shiny-silver-strip that runs down it, at the very bottom of it, is that 'Royal Seal' with the Lion-and-Unicorn on it. NOW...on the new PLASTIC money slowly being rolled-out, NO Lion, NO Unicorn, NO 'Royal Seal.' So...whats up with THAT, Admiral Duncan? Us NON-Nobles wanna know!",
