However, have you ever noticed that the 'Arms-of-Canada' is NOT on the new bills? Why is the 'Arms-of-Canada' on the old-paper-money, but, not on the new-plastic-money?\"\n\nMaybe you guys should do a story on whether the new bills are even legitimate to begin with?\n\nThank you,\nDerek\n\nhttp://www.torontosun.com/2012/11/07/forgers-take-crack-at-canadas-polymer-bills",
