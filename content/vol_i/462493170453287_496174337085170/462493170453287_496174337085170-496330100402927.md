   "message": "Hey Adam :) , i went through something similar recently, the copper was sooking cause my motorcycle was not registered. i asked him where he got the info from to which he replied. From our minder system.. Oh, i said is that where you access the Department of Transports Data base? .. Yes relied Mr Plod, I then said, So you accessed the data base and got all the details of a motorcycle thats registered in the system .. Yes replied Mr Plod.. point being, the motorcycle is registered only the fee has not been paid .. it is not a crime to not pay a fee, nor is it a criminal offence to not pay a fee .. this same little dance has been argued in court .. and the end result, was case dismissed. The Court advised Mr Plod to drop the matter to avoid setting a precident. \n\nInteresting words \n\nRegistration \nRegistrant \nRegistry \nRegister",
