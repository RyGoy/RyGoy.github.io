   "message": "Dan is correct. I couldn't have said it better myself! I can sure TYPE it better though! :P\n\nThe court does not DENY and actually ACCEPTS that they have no jurisdiction. That is the basis for denying an appeal!\n\nIf you go to the dentist and say \"Gimme a new fuel injector for my car\", he's going to say no, and bill you for the time you wasted.\n\nYou can APPEAL to his \"manager\", but that won't change anything. The manager can't help. Don't bother him (Said this ruling)!",
