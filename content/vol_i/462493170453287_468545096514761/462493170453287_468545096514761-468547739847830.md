   "message": "Here is the answer i got in my LATEST(i send them a number of emails to the Canadian Payments Association):\n\n Hi,\n \nCan you give me the link where it shows on your website the proper way to fill-out a bill-payment-remittance for proper presentment-and-acceptance for payment to a biller?\n \nThank you,\nDerek\n\nGood morning,\n \nThank you for contacting the Canadian Payments Association (CPA).\n \nCPA Rules and Standards do not address how a consumer must fill out a bill payment remittance for payment to a biller. For assistance, please contact your financial institution and/or the biller directly.\n\nRegards,\nCPA Public Affairs\n \nGood evening,\n\nUmmm, im confused; why would i ask my/a financial-institution and/or the biller on the proper way of filling out a bill-payment-remittance?  I was under the impression that was the job of the Canadian Payments Association to regulate such matters, hence the whole purpose of having something like the 'Canadian Payments Act' to begin with; am i to believe that private-financial-institutions, and private-biller-corporations, have now been left with regulating such matters?  That would seem to be a Conflict-of-Interest, would it not?      :/\n\nThank you,\nDerek \n\nAnswer: still waiting.......<info@cdnpay.ca> - if'ya need it ;)",
