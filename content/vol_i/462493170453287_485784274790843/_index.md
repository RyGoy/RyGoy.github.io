   "message": "Talked to a guy yesterday who says he pays/discharges his bills basically by ACCEPTED-FOR-VALUE, this is how he marks-it-up:\n\n1. Crawford and Falconbridge's Bills of Exchange book apparently says, all you have to print is ACCEPT at the top of the bill..'ACCEPTED-FOR-VALUE' is not necessary\n\n2. your signature on the front of it\n\n3. 'without recourse,' after your signature\n\n4. fill-in the empty 'Amount-box'...give them a little more than you supposedly owe, like a tip, make it less likely for them to complain about it\n\n5. put the date\n\n6. your SIN# with no dashes- 123456789\n\n7. print something in regards to section 3. of the Bills of Exchange Act 1985 which states: Thing done in good faith\n\n3. A thing is deemed to be done in good faith, within the meaning of this Act, where it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not.\n\nhttp://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-4/page-2.html#h-3\n\nInteresting how this Federal Government page lists the Bills of Exchange Act as CONSUMER LEGISLATION, and, highlights PART V. in brackets:\nhttp://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/icgc.nsf/eng/h_00029.html#consumer",
