   "message": "GAIL..i have taken Scott's advice on this and are currently working on a Claim-of-Right to submit to the biller before i do anything regarding this, in fact ive titled it- CLAIM OF NATURAL LAW AND COMMON LAW INHERITANCE JURISDICTION RIGHT NOTICE, so no public-servant can say back to me- \"Umm, we are unclear as to what it is you're asking. Can you please provide for us more details?\" - like they usually do. I think the title pretty much speaks for itself. The NOTICE is acting as a 'heads-up,' cuz they've become accustomed to you sending them LEGAL TENDER, right?",
