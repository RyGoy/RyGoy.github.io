   "message": "But if Scott says ultimately, that LEGAL TENDER = a TENDER FOR LAW.. and that a BILL = OFFERS LAW.. 'a fortiori' (latin-law-phrase) by even greater force of logic, wouldnt a BILL-payment-remittance be OFFERing you a TENDER FOR LAW? (look-up OFFER and TENDER in a thesaurus)....but they dont want you to know that, hence, why i imagine they codefied it being a BILL with the use of the '96' in the bottom-right-hand-corner",
