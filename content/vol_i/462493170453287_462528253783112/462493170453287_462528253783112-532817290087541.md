   "message": "Scott: Is the \"special examiner's office\" run by a friend you trust?\n\nDerek Hill: No.\n\nScott: Hmm... is that a NO?\n\nDerek Hill: Duh.\n\nScott: I see. So not someone you trust. Do you do business privately with them?\n\nDerek Hill: Yes Since its their own private business. People just went there for their services and used it for court. That is how the court found out about them and started referring people to go there to help avoid trial.\n\nScott: No huh? So the COURT sent you to these strangers then, and stated they may \"examine\" you?\n\nDerek:No. Special examiners officer is there so i can question the applicant/respondent whichever it may be so i can seek clarification and establish a statement of facts. All answers are given under oath. I read up a lot of cases with other fathers that questioning was enough to settle.",
