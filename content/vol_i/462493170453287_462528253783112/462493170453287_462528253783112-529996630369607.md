   "message": "As I said... Christians are reading. They believe bullshit (That's what MAKES them Christians). I don't want bullshit spread by some dumb-ass Jesus Jockey and claiming TENDER FOR LAW as the source.\n\nAlways write knowing that very stupid Christians are reading. I don't want them spreading any more bullshit/lies than they already do. They are retarded, and you have to write for the retarded.\n\n...if Pierre can understand you, then you've probably dumbed it down far enough. :D Don't hurt yourself by trying harder than that... trust me, on this one.",
