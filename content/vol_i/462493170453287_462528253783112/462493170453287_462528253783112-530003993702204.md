   "message": "I know, but Christians MAKE it your intention.\n\nThey all have 3 things in common.\n\nThey are adults with imaginary friends.\nThey all lie about people.\nThey ALWAYS misread. Usually in the WORST possible way.\n\n...all the while, preaching \"love\". They are vile creations of the Nobility and they LOVE their slave chains. They defend them viciously. Needless to say, critical thought tends to atrophy under those conditions.\n\nEven if they don't know it consciously, they mean you harm. They are programmed that way. Always remember that.",
