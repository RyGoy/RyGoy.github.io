   "message": "Ok, so, make SURE(ty) that i dont SIGN the back of whatever cheque i am bringing to the bank, like i always have in the past. I ONLY print like Pierre mentioned, FOR DEPOSIT ONLY. They DEPOSIT the cheque into my account. *shrugs* Now what? I want to go buy a coffee, but my pockets are empty. How do i go about getting the CASH now that i need to go buy my coffee, without creating joinder with the government accepting their LEGAL TENDER?",
