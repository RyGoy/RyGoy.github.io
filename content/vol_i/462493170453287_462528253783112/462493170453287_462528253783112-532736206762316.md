I'll answer for you. i have better things to do then wait for your non-answer.\n\nScott: Is the \"special examiner's office\" run by a friend you trust?\n\nDerek Hill: Duh.\n\nScott: Hmm... is that a NO?\n\nDerek Hill: Duh.\n\nScott: I see. So not someone you trust. Do you do business privately with them?\n\nDerek Hill: Duh.\n\nScott: No huh? So the COURT sent you to these strangers then, and stated they may \"examine\" you?\n\nDerek Hill: Duh?\n\nScott: Remind me again how you don't have surety?",
