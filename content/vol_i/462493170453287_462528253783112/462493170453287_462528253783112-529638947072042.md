   "message": "Barter. So what of land? Pretty much everyone has been fooled into thinking they \"own\" land because they \"payed\" for it. Can we not claim to be the one holding the land we have put all our sweat equity into for future generations? How does legal tender apply to this area if it is used to acquire land? I am so confused how anyone can simply apply rules when you provided the labour?",
