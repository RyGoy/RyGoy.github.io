   "message": "Ok. So now, knowing this, whats the ALTERNATIVE? I go to a bank, with a cheque, i endorse it, the teller starts pulling-out LEGAL TENDER, counts it, then begins to count it out to me on the counter, and not like she'd know what was going-on anyways, but i say to her- \"No thank you. I decline your offer of law to give me legal tender, in exchange for my signature..(or something like that)\" NOW WHAT?
