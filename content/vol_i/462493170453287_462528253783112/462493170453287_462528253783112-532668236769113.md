   "message": "Finally i found it.\n\nTo an alternative of paying with legal tender, how would you deal with agencies such as special examiners office(yes i'm aware that you said not to even involve yourself in it), but nonetheless  its for the child.\n\nThe agencies i need to involve requires cash or credit card.
