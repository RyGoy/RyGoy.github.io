   "message": "The fact that you arrogantly believed you knew what \"THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER\" means does not mean any \"intent to defraud\" exists. You are just upset that you are stupid.\n\nDon't worry though, everyone else is like that too. Ask everyone you know, what \"this note is legal tender\" means. They will make all sorts of bullshit up and say bullshit like \"what they means to say is...\"\n\nSeriously, fuck off with that shit. I'm nearing the end of my oath and I just won't put up with things like that. \n\nI SAY VERY CLEARLY AND CONCISELY, WHAT I FUCKING MEAN! If you imply otherwise, you will be banned for chronic stupidity, as chronic cases are a drain and a burden.",
