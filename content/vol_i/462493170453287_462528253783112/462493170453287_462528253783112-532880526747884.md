   "message": "Sorry Derek Hill, but my transcript of our conversation is more accurate.\n\nYou did not CHOOSE to do business with them. They are a SERVICE. The GOVERNMENT is NOT a person, and only a person can pay. YOU have surety, no matter what delusions you pull out of your ass.\n\nYour \"remedy\" is wait until your child is 18. The end.\n\nThat's what you get for knocking up skanks. PRETENDING I'm not right, doesn't really change any of the factors.\n\nThis is why I have NO interest in assisting you in ANY way. You've never listened before.\nYou make shit up.\nYou focus on the wrong things whenever I tell you ANYTHING and you create this fantasy-world of non-reality, and get confused when things don't go the way you think they should.\n\nSO, let's make the conversation accurate again!\n\nScott: Is the \"special examiner's office\" run by a friend you trust?\n\nDerek Hill: Duh.\n\nScott: Hmm... is that a NO?\n\nDerek Hill: Duh.\n\nScott: I see. So not someone you trust. Do you do business privately with them?\n\nDerek Hill: Duh.\n\nScott: No huh? So the COURT sent you to these strangers then, and stated they may \"examine\" you?\n\nDerek Hill: Duh?\n\nScott: Remind me again how you don't have surety?\n\nAnd yes the COURT sent you. At no time do people \"Shop around\" for a \"special examiner\".",
