   "message": "LOL Derek.  I have been asking them about 12 USC 411 (which is what you link is about) since June!  I have asked all the way up to the Treasury Dept.  I sent a registered mail, returned receipt on Aug 8 to the Treasury asking that very question.  Of course I asked my commercial bank first, then the FedRes first and they blocked me by dancing around it, then when requestioned stated \"they feel they have answered that question\".  As of today, I have not received the Green Card back yet.  I checked the tracking number and saw that it had been \"received\".  Still no answer!!  My next step will be administratively get a summary judgement and assert my intent!",
