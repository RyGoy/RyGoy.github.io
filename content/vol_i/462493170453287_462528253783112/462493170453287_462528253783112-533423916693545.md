   "message": "Scott Duncan: Seriously though, you are living in a universe, that by its very nature, is trying TO KILL YOU.\n\nWe are on a tiny rock, in a thin magnetic field, and beyond that is a universe that you will DIE if you are actually there. Down here on the surface it's not much better.\n\nHomo-sapiens are NOT by any stretch of the imagination \"sovereign\". We need to cooperatively sustain ourselves, because as animals go, we kind of suck. No fur/horns/spikes/sharp talons, to protect us... Just a soft tasty snack for anything with a spine, that eats other things.\n\nWhat level of \"sovereign\" do you think you can achieve alone?\n\nI for one would die without Tara, my crew, and my trustees and officers. I REALLY DO serve them, because they REALLY DO make my life in EVERY MEASURABLE WAY, better than the majority.\n\n...but I'm NOT \"sovereign\" by ANY stretch of the imagination. I need them. They seem to need me. So, no sovereignty for Scott Duncan.",
