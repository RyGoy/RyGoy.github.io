   "message": "TRY to imagine what it's like knowing from childhood, what you are just learning now.\n\nNow add having EVERYONE you were supposed to trust, declare you \"bad\" or \"crazy\" for daring to propose that its wrong to live in comfort, at the expense of your fellow man.\n\nTHEN try warn your fellow man, and get called worse by the likes of Will Preach Leeman and assorted nazis who claim their imaginary friend is the answer. (WE MADE IT UP! I KNOW JESUS IS PRETEND BECAUSE WE [Nobility] INVENTED HIM!)\n\nImagine a lifetime of people hating you and harming you because you dared say the things you do right now, to the people who could fix the problem.\n\nYou don't get to cry, Cara. You aren't qualified to know the sadness yet.",
