   "message": "I am genuinely curious as to the correct perspective for both of these questions. Any feedback is as always, greatly appreciated.

You can live without it, because you are free to accept OR offer anything you DEEM valuable.\n\nNo! You can not live without it, because it offers protection/redress/remedy for your debtor.",
