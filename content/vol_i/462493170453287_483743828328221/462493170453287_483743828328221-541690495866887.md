This has nothing to DO with the value of others (Which is what rent is).\n\nIf you need ME to do anything, you will need to pay me in BITCOIN. I simply don't accept anything else. If I get enough of them, I can exchange them for any other currency, at a VERY competitive rate, to pay for things of value offered by others. The only difference is that YOU use a different currency than everyone else.\n\nNo magic. Just jurisdiction.",
