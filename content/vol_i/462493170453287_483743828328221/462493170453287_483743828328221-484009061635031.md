   "message": "It probably has a Kumquat stuck in it.\n\nI'll dumb it down so there is no confusion. ALL interaction with you costs ME TIME. THAT is something I VALUE. You CONSUMING that value and returning NOTHING creates what's called a DEFICIT.\n\nYou are female.\nI am an abnormally heterosexual man.\n\nYour cunt is the only thing you have that I would value. Time spent utilizing it is GREATLY appreciated. It is the only time I can exist in ONE time and that one thing that YOU possess, is the ONE THING that you have that I could POSSIBLY value.\n\nThe same is true with every OTHER woman here.\n\nDon't ask questions you don't want answers to. I won't lie.",
