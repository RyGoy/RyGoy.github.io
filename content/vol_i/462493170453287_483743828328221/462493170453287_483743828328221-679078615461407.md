Figuratively.\n\nIn 2 generations the people will be thinned out enough that we won't have the problems/damage that we do now.\n\nThere WILL come a point, where I say \"WAKE UP, or DIE\"... and I'll have something to back it up.\n\nThen people will use an HONEST money system as if their lives depended on it...because their lives WILL depend on it. \n\n____________________________________________________________\nThis was originally posted back when I first joined the group... I probably thought, \"What the fuck is this fella on about?\"\n\nRe-reading it now it makes so much sense... Ties everything in together...\n\nGet busy livin' (producing value) or get busy dyin' (being naturally selected for extinction)\n\n:D Hup ya boya!",
