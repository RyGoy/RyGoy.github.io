   "message": "Hum, should I start one of those \"no-point-in-discussing-this-cyber-debate\" response? But I can, for entertaintment purposes only, mention a few \"facts\". I want to start wih saying that I would be lying if I wished harm to anyone. That being said: fact #1; I dont need to know the \"facts\" to give my opinion that the behavior seen in the video is contrary to anyones interest (where is the love?)while in court, were there is people with guns, and other scary stuff. Fact #2; You were whinning, and you are STILL whinning (read your previous comments). Fact #3; without having to know the facts, this statement still remains a fact: \"Just showing-up in your vessel presumes joinder.\" Fact #4; You wrote 2 paragraphs of absolutely nothing of substance. Fact #5; at 4:45pm AST, 51 people had seen this thead. Only 3 likes so far. Its still early in the west coast, though. Fact #6, taking \"offense\" of my opinion creates the presumption of authority... of me, over you! Think about it. Fact # 7, I sincerely wish you well, and hope you don't take offense of strangers opinions. Now if you all excuse me, I have to catch me some \"freewomen\".",
