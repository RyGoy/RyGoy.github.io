   "message": "<<[44] The truth is that the system needs conflict, it demands controversy- it relishes and celebrates the belligerent litigant � as the poster character for supporting propaganda aligned at warning others, that such �anti-law�, �anti-establishment� and �anti-government� behavior will not be tolerated. Those that actively pursue the courts, sometimes with personal vendettas unfortunately created terrible injury against the law and the rest of society by enabling the system to re-set itself and parody genuine concerns as �extremists� and more recently as �paper terrorists�.>>\n\n<<[59] It is how we behave, above all, that determines the success or failure to represent the law. The arrogant, the aggressive the vengeful litigant injures the law as much as the corrupt official. The weak, the frightened, the ignorant litigant injures the law and their own character by doubting themselves and failing to work on their competence and knowledge.>> http://blog.ucadia.com/2012/11/the-10-biggest-errors-most-people-make.html",
