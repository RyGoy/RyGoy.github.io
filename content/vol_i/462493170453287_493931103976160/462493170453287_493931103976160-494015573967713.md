   "message": "maybe i seem reckless, definately i dont have all the answers BUT I do see whats wrong. At what point do we know we know enough? only at the point we are tested & so rather than sit on fb pontificating to others i will seek out my education at the school of hard knocks. This page has been a revelation to me & is changing the way i perceive, in my case i had been following the marc stevens approach & questioning the facts/blocking the jurisdiction which worked for a bit until they decided skip that bit. I've been a listener to dean clifford as well so i had filed my affidavit with the AG, i looked into the presumptions & definitions & removed myself from jurisdiction. I did'nt \"believe\" the judge could do what he did ....lol but he did (lesson learned TY) I've decided to let go much of what i \"believed\" i knew & realise what scott is trying to teach here, the dependency on others & presuming we understand what were talking about/ definitions of words we use. I am a humble student of this page, mistakes are ok as long as i learn.",
