Just showing-up in your vessel presumes joinder. Lucky this guy was not manhandled by their private security.                                                                               I think the \"judge\" was nice to this guy, despite of the baby tamtrums. That is why I think many \"sovereign citizens\" and \"freemen\" \"movements\" are getting more people into jail, than any special task force could on it's own.          <<Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.>>",
