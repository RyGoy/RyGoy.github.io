   "message": "Derek Moran: Fuck, thats right..there's the part where Scott said to ask the Judge if it were best he acted as the Administrator for todays proceedings, i think i made a note of that somewhere\n\nDerek Moran: got it!... \"Barring the court's objection, I believe the best interests of all parties would be met if YOU were the administrator, your honour, don't you agree? First an apology: If I have lead to the court to believe I am a surety in this matter, than that would be a MISTAKE. Please forgive me (They MUST forgive). Now, I'd like to cover the matter of surety, now that there is a competent administrator, would you be so kind as to identify, for the record, who is surety in this matter?\" Then you respond with questions to EVERYTHING. It's a battle of wills and intellect.\n\nScott Duncan: Not bad!\n\nScott Duncan: Not bad at all!\n\nBeverly Berta Braakschmack: Derek, I am here on that matter, how can I help solve this?",
