   "message": "They can claim our name in copyright which enables them to do as they see fit with it however they need a warm body to attach their securities to it. They cannot however, claim our name in copy hold which is a higher claim in Estate Law. As long as you make it clear you are not the surety and there is numerous ways to do it, I do it in my affidavit and remind them of it right away; my last attendance i said; Will you be hearing the matter today without prejudice and in good faith your honor? (yes) thank you, can I have your Oath on that promise? (yes) Thank you, is my affidavit on the record? if they say no i dont have it I provide a copy for the judge and threaten to read it in its entirety , usally they find it.",
