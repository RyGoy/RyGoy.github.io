   "message": "Homework done.... and an opinion offered.  Some metaphors are used ... This also address�s Scott Duncan�s 4 points above.\n\n Results:     \n\n Quite simply, the moment of clarity that comes with long sought after comprehension of truth.  \nA conclusion to the final fragments of thought needed to complete an idea.  Leading to a solution that could apply to others, it definitely applies to me.  A cumulation of many years research looking for truth. \n\n Let me explain.\n\n I arrived to this page muddled and confused thinking I had a comprehension of the Sovereign movement and process�s to rectify the deception.  I stand corrected.\n\n To comprehend my epiphany one must be aware of certain facts. the following is paraphrased and based on research which I can site upon request.\n\n We are all born into something. Whatever it is, it is something. What comes with it is quite simply, indoctrination.  We are imprinted from the get go to follow in our cultures footsteps.  That is as simple as I can make it.  It is what it is.\n\n If you are reading this you are in some manner affected by the imprinting on many different levels of being, you cannot not be. As a result, a condition of life has been programmed into us, intentional or not. A condition that affects us in 3 very powerful ways.  \n\n In most cases accompanied by multiple traumas\n\n 1.  Learned helplessness/superiority      Prey/ Hunter\n one example:\n Relying on systems of faith including but not limited to:    Religion, No Religion, Politics, Racism, Tolerance,                                                                                                                                money, sex, occupation etc. \n\n\n\nall systems require some sort of faith in what you                                                                                                                             are doing is right for you based on cultural biasses.\n\n 2.   Suspension of Reason:\n Every cult has a book, the initiates of that particular cult have a cultural version of their truth. with that software installed to our bio metric operating system we cannot think naturally\n.  Clich�s are often used in all manner and forms that suspend analytical analysis and critical thinking, compounded by mass media and false teachings.\n\n 3.   Chronic Frustration: \n  All the stress�s over a programmed world view that is made up of  multiple software installations manifesting in addiction on many levels. Resulting in operating systems temporarily going offline and creating physical and psychological disease. Affecting the whole...... \n\n The outrage one feels upon investigation is a result of breaking away from the betrayal of trust on many levels, it affects us to the core of our beings.  Our Operating systems have been infected with numerous insidious virus�s that take away from our natural state.  Symptoms of infection: the nagging feeling something is going on but I can�t quite put my finger on it, just out of reach of my primitive, stupor induced mind.\n\n The anger I once felt has now stiffened into resolve.   The moment of clarity was akin to a huge, big ass safe being opened, the combination clicked and the bolts thunked out of place and Holy Shit ... understanding money in a whole new way lead to the final part of my solution for this sovereign being.\n\n I am not a greedy guy, I do want security and health for my being. For me it looks like a rejuvenating way to farm. working in harmony with natural process�s with a blend of old and new technologies.  I can do what is termed as Bio Mimicry, replicating the natural process of the way the millions of buffalo lived for centuries, until recently, as a crucial component of the North American ecosystem.  The innovation was created by a guy named Joel Salitan of Polyface farms,  he is the innovator behind this process. With light weight plastic electric fences that have micro chip cable of sustaining a voltage high enough to humanely keep the cattle contained and safe from predators and low enough not to melt the plastic ( Nasa tech), that are sized according to what nature can sustain a herd of cows on, about 100 head on 1 acre for 1 day, they invade, disturb the land eat the grass down to the nub, leave gifts of fertilizer then move them to the next patch to an already setup 1 acre paddock to which they go for 1 day and so on and so on. Grass-fed not acidic corn which is not a food for an omnivore hugely different than what is available in most places. 3 days later come the chickens, heritage chickens non genetically manipulated, 2 kinds, the egg ones and the eating ones, 8 week growing cycle. They come in a spread the fertilizer and disturb the ground some more also grass-fed supplemented with healthy feed.... Exchange can begin then.  Also  hogs....  I have attached a link.... He explains it perfectly. It is based on science and the blending of tech.\n\n What� the big deal?  It is based on 0 .... balancing the ledgers in cooperation with nature.  Zero is phenomenal, it is in balance. In every way.   The whole thing works in a natural process and offsets many environmental concerns.... it creates topsoil.        a  little independent system of bio diversity. which if done as choice could have a huge impact the process is learnable and simple. the skill set is one which I have.    \n\n I appeal to your sensibilities and superiors to look at this as a complimentary way to live the principles outlined by the film �Money as Debt III�.  This process is simple, duplicatable and most importantly scalable, we can make them fit any community on the face of the planet.\n\n This could be  BENEFIT to all of us. The awake and asleep...\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBZgANtcXm8",
