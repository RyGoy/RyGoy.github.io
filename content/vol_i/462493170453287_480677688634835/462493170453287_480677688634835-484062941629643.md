   "message": "Sovereign movement SOLVED:\n\n 66.   It is, of course, true that democracy expresses the sovereign will of the people. \n\n67     The CONSENT of the governed is a value that is basic to our understanding of a free and democratic society.  Yet democracy in any real sense of the word cannot exist without the rule of law.  It is the law that creates the framework within which the \"sovereign will\" is to be ascertained and implemented.\n\nhttp://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=consent&language=en&searchTitle=Search+all+CanLII+Databases&path=/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii793/1998canlii793.html&searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAHY29uc2VudAAAAAAAAAE",
