   "message": "\"You never know until you try\". - This is one of those childhood programming turds your parents put into you. You might enjoy diving into a bucket of your own vomit! \"You never know until you try\"! :D\n\nIn fact, I'll just be polite and let you go first. Stay submerged in your own vomit for at least 5 minutes, pondering the utter stupidity of \"You never know until you try\", to get the full effect :D",
