   "message": "RE: \" YOU ONLY NEED MONEY WHEN YOU ARE SPENDING IT!\n\nThe rest of the time MONEY is DEBT and OBLIGATION. HOARDING IT IS STUPID!\"       So there are THINGS that Change their Positions, in order to transfer a THING from one USER to another a MEDIUM is needed. I have to SPEND money in order to redirect the THING towards ME? IF I would have lots of THINGS that are Considered VALUABLE can I Introduce another MEDIUM to EXCHANGE or transfer My THINGS with Another USERS??? I SEE two different Playgrounds here what are they called?",
