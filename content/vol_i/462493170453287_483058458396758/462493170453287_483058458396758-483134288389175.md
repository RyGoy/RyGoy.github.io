   "message": "I know why Amazon and Apple make as much as they do- they sell iphones and ipods and books and Kindles, they have a product to sell. However, im not quite sure why each of the 5 major banks make $1 Billion a QUARTER, pure, profit. AND, thats on-top of paying-off all their expenses off-the-top, and still $1 Billion in profit every quarter. But, unlike Apple and Amazon, a bank doesnt sell books and Kindles. What is a bank's product? ZERO. They collect our signatures.. and harvest our credit.",
