   "message": "OK, let me dumb it down:\n\nKnowing or not, you are compelled to use money and the LEGAL (Surety and Accounting)  contract that money provides. That's its \"value\". The problem is that they are no longer following their own rules. I have said this from the beginning, and claims to the contrary will simply be dismissed as delusion.\n\nI speak up now, just as i spoke up in the 80s and in 1997. THIS time I have an answer EVERYONE can use, not just \"special\" people like me. I did my best to communicate it to all who can grasp it.\n\nI end up fighting the free-dumbers, and building disruptive banking networks.\n\nThat is what I am responsible for. Nothing else.\n\nCLEAR?\n\nI am NOT responsible for the parasites and their \"What are you gonna do about it\" attitude. I warned it was coming. That's it.",
