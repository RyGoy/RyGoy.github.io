   "message": "I haven't read ANYWHERE on THE TENDER FOR LAW anything that leads me to think that at any time I will learn how to \"get\" a treasury direct account that I could discharge my liabilities with. And it is because even if you could do that they wouldn't let you. That shit is a myth. It is bull shit. \nWhat I have read though is how to have a fucking bank. I actually have a fucking bank. Given I'm not EXACTLY sure what to do with it YET. There are debts being created and I have given everything to the TRUST. I think that once everything is SECURED then this bank will have value that can be draw  against. Does that make sense? Create an account then use the bank to draw from it or discharge liabilities with it? Isn't that what \"THEY\" do only they are very irresponsible. That makes sense to me AND seems easy. Maybe I'm just a semi-evolved chimp. What the fuck do I know?",
