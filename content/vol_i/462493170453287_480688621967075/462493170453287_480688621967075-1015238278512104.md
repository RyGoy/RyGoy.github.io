   "message": "I'm not sure why people think my saying \"told you so\" is some sort of character flaw. I really earned it, and 99% of the world is actively opposed to what I say, when I first say it.\n\n...except I only say what is true. This means \"I Told You So\" is something that MUST come to pass.\n\nEither grasp what I am saying, when I say it, or live with \"I told you so\" after. \"Told you so\", is my RIGHT. I earned it. Those who are LESS than me dared contradict me, and claim it's their \"right\" to do so, which I agree with, if I get my \"told you so\" with no grief.\n\nYou are wrong, I am not. You don't get to play \"victim\" and fault me for the fact that you are LESS than I am.\n\n\"Told you so\" is not a character flaw. It is PROOF I AM BETTER THAN YOU.",
