   "message": "I know I'm a slave. I have an extremely difficult time living with that. It's contrary to what I am. I've never been too keen on authority. I will continue to learn and try to take advantage of the coming abundance. I can't go to war with the powers that be and succeed at this point. I will die. If somebody collapses the banking system and starts a war just maybe there'll be a vacuum where folks like myself can step in and get something done. Ultimately I'd rather watch the world burn down around me and take my chances than to agonizingly keep playing the game as a slave.",
