Notify them via an AFFIDAVIT/AFFIRMATION, and staple a Notice of Claim to this AFFIDAVIT/AFFIRMATION.\n\n2). The Notice of Claim has to be clear and precise. Why you claim and HOW much you claim.\n\n3). You need to let them the time to rebut and it needs to be clearly written on the claim that if you are wrong, just tell me in writing and I will CANCEL this claim on the spot. Let them all the latitude to DESTROY the claim�.\n\n4). If they do not answer, it means that they can not challenge the claim, so then, an invoice need to be sent�.and again, tell them that if you are wrong, just to tell you in writing and you will CANCEL this invoice�\n\n5). And then a Notice saying you did not receive payment and again, tell them that if you are wrong, just to tell you in writing and you will CANCEL this invoice�\n\n6). And then a Final Notice saying you did not receive payment and again, tell them that if you are wrong, just to tell you in writing and you will CANCEL this invoice�\n\n7). And then a DEFAULT Notice saying that they are now in DEFAULT, and have 72 hours to settle the matter, and it is now obviously a FACT that you are right, there�s no way they can tell otherwise now :P\n\n8). Lien��too late for them now :/",
