   "message": "yes....I am right now trying to figure out if this is a waste of time or not.  I have 2 issues pending right now and they do not give a fuck about who or what the surety is.  They only want ME to pay.  So, yes, Michael, I am wondering if learning this is a waste of time and bullets are a better answer.  I have spent countless thousands of hours and countless thousands of dollars and I am in a much worse position than I have ever been in.  I would like to be compensated for all this time and expenses, none of this is my fault.",
