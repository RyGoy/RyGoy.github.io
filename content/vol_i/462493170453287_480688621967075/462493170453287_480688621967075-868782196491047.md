   "message": "I'll list the items:\n\n\"received and accepted = endorsed\"  Although this may be true, and on it's face makes sense, no one gives a fuck.  Acceptance of registered mail has in no way ever (in my experience) equaled an endorsement.  What can we do about it?\n\nYou taught us to have a bank, but we collectively have no clue what to do with this bank.  What do we do with this bank?  How do we use it to overthrow a banking system?\n\nWhy did you say this: \n\"So now you have 3 of the SAME THINGS, DON'T WE?\n\nBIRTH CERTIFICATE\nTWENTY DOLLAR BILL\nCHEQUE FROM PIERRE TO SCOTT\"?\n\nI liened the NAME 18 months ago....it has stopped NO ONE from harassing me.  Actually, they seem to view it as some kind of challenge.  \n\nAlthough you tell the verifiable truth as far as everything I have been able to check, what are we actually supposed to with it?  \n\nI am frustrated....we have old guys in here who get their electricity shut off after doing everything right.  The advice is \"go to war\".  You have always said \"if its hard, you are doing it wrong\".....this is clearly hard, what's the easy way?",
