Under this test, total assets should be no greater than 20 times capital, although this multiple can be exceeded with the Superintendent's prior approval to an amount no greater than 23 times. Alternatively, the Superintendent may prescribe a lower multiple. In setting the assets to capital multiple for individual institutions, the Superintendent will consider such factors as operating and management experience, strength of parent, earnings, diversification of assets, type of assets and appetite for risk.\n\nhttp://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/CAR_chpt1.aspx#ToC19Theassetstocapitalmultiple",
