   "message": "(sorry Scott, not exactly case-law..but it will have to do)  ;)\n\nHOW BANKS CREATE, AND WOULD LIKE TO CREATE, MORE CREDIT THEY STEAL FROM YOU\n\nINDUSTRY COMMENTS: Section 1.9, Asset to capital multiple\nWould OSFI please consider a recalibration of the 20x and 23x maximum assets to capital multiple (ACM). The change in the definition of capital will increase banksï¿½ ACM without a corresponding increase in risk taking. Higher maximum ACM would allow banks to absorb the change to the definition of capital (i.e. which will put Canadian banks at a disadvantage as we phase in new capital deductions), and put banks in a better position to deal with the complications arising from managing the phase-out of existing Tier 2 capital (i.e. subordinated debentures), while planning for the ultimate transition to the new Tier 1-based Basel III Leverage Ratio.\n\nOSFI RESPONSE: OSFI does not feel it would be prudent to increase the maximum authorized Assets to Capital Multiple at this time given the Basel III leverage ratio is still under review and as we move towards public disclosure of the leverage ratio in 2015 and implementation in 2018,\n\n",
