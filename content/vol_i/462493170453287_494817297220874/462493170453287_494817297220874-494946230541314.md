'The common law recognises an adultï¿½s right to change his or her name. Provided there is no intent to defraud or deceive and inflict pecuniary loss on another, a person may assume any new or additional name including one which is used by another.'...\n\nMakes no mention of a child/baby's name being changed in order to defraud, deceive and inflict pecuniary loss on another...cheeky bastards!!",
