   "message": "Yes, Adam, something �big� is coming.  The fact that you are asking this question is mildly disturbing as it should be self-evident.  Think of it as a giant game of �Risk� where progress to an inevitable conclusion is not measured in hours or minutes, but in events.  In seduction, if you have held her hand, exchanged passionate kisses, and have moved on to exploring erogenous zones, it is practically a foregone conclusion you're going to get laid.  In both circumstances I can't tell you exactly what form or position(s) the outcome will manifest; but I can tell you that it does involve getting fucked.\n\nThink of your own recent experiences, look at the domestic and global events that are unfolding, and put the pieces together.\n\nScott is honouring a promise to shovel as much information out there as possible.  I have long been of the position that his efforts are largely fruitile (pointless, but with a fruity flavour).  Time will tell I guess.  One man cannot stop a flood.  One man with thousands of people and sand bags just might.\n\nIn the immortal words of Cave Johnson, \"I like your grit. Hustle could use some work though, now let's solve this thing!\"",
