The government has NO standing, until there is conflict. That's what you agreed to on the license.\n\nThe \"Justice\" in that case could writ how much they thought the movie \"Pearl Harbour\" sucked, and it makes no difference.\n\nI could kill this the second it was introduced. This is a case I would go into court to argue. These are scare tactics designed to leverage your ignorance, and start searching for \"snipes\".\n\nhttp://youtu.be/2z3GJiZqDCI",
