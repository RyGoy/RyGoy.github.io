   "message": "So Scott- is what you're saying, is that if CAS shows up to your door with an ORDER signed by a Judge, saying that they are there to take your kids away..you should say to them- \"Oh terrific, today is my lucky day! You have an ORDER for me from a judge, who refused to sign an ORDER letting you steal my kids from me probably because he didnt want to be the reason why some kids got stolen from their parents. GREAT. Now fuck off and get off my property!\"",
