   "message": "1. i dont listen to american shows. i got priviledged from canlii cases when dealing with defamation from lawyers. all cases was dismissed because lawyers were priviledged members or something. The only times lawyers were charged with perjury is if they went out of their way to lie under a sworn oath.\n\nYour making alot of very big assumptions, why would i listen to american shows if im in canada?\n\nI suspect heresay evidence is your pointing it against me claiming that i heard this and that from this or that person.
