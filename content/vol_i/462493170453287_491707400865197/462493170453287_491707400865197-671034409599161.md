   "message": "What makes you think I am neglecting my children's future because I do not see the relevance of attending this meeting?\n\nI did take a break when I took them out of the system and I gave them one as well because I needed to figure out what was best for THEM.\n\nAnd being in the school system for numerous years doesn't make them NEGLECTED?\n\nI ALWAYS have their best interest at heart. I just didn't know how to start and I know from experience that even if you are one or two years without doing actual HOMEWORK, that it takes a few months to recuperate what is thought in public schools.\n\nSo my worry was to figure out what to teach and how without fucking them up even more then they were.\n\nI took the time and everything is falling into place now. I've been in the FREEDUMMM mode for almost a year with Dean and been in this group for a few months so it's been three kind of brainwashing in three different directions. \n\nI am back on track and my convictions on education and how it should be done with respect with what the children are is back on track and has been for a few months. Just haven't gone full throttle yet.",
