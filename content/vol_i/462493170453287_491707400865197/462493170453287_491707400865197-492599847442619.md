   "message": "Sure. You're an idiot.\n\n...I'm sorry, did you want more? Lawyers are THIRD PARTIES in ANY dispute. The Lawyers ACT AS REPRESENTATIVE of the party. Limited liability. It's why they refer to each other as \"my friend\". there's no conflict themselves. THE PARTIES have the conflict. When the GOVERNMENT uses a \"crown attorney\", they are \"representing\" an \"injured party\".\n\nNone of the mythology you are making up has ANY basis in reality. Any other rectally-inspired concepts?",
