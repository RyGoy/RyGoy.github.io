I'll just fill in for BOTH sides...\n\nDo you know what hearsay evidence is?\n\n...duh, *prattling on with content-free bullshit.*\n\nIs that a yes or no?\n\n...*more content-free bullshit*.\n\nAfter 100 or so posts we establish that HEARSAY evidence is third-party testimony  and is not admissible.\n\nNext I ask \"what is a legal fiction\", and then the readers would have to wade through/endure more of your content-free bullshit...\n\nLeading to...\n\n\"OBJECTION!
