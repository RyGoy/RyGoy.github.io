Scott mentioned that facebook and Google+ (though i have no idea what Google+ is), are methods of placing a PUBLIC NOTICE, along with the classifieds of a newspaper. Place somesort of an ESTOPPEL against her, barring HER from BARRING you, from seeing your child. POST it on her page. Print off a copy of it if you have to use it later, go get a copy of it NOTARIZED. I dunno..im just thinkin' outside the box here for'ya man as i have no experience with this.",
