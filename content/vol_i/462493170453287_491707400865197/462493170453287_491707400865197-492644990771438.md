   "message": "First this \"privileged communication\" is bullshit you picked up in american legal shows, and has NO basis in reality. Limited liability means a lawyer can never BE charged with perjury, so you pulled THAT out of your ass too. THE ONLY thing a lawyer can EVER be charged with is the misappropriation of funds in a trust. THAT IS IT. NO OTHER REASON. There is only one crime in Admiralty; Interference with Commerce. BREACH OF TRUST, thus the \"privileged communication\" between a lawyer and client myth was born. Credulous people like yourself perpetrate this myth. Here in reality, such a thing would conflict with their oath to the LAW SOCIETY.\n\nSO first question: Do you know what hearsay evidence is?",
