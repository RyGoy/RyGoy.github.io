   "message": "First, because I don't see the relevance of it. Since we are registering the persons why do the children have to go?\n\nBecause like you just posted \"I've asked for it\".\n\nOk so, How do I UN-register their persons or undo what was done?\n\nThat's why I thought Notice of Mistake would be a good option to clear things up. \n\nI have to register the children's persons.
