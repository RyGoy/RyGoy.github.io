   "message": "An excellent article Scott. I'm just glad my youngest turned 18 last week and I got through her childhood unscathed. I had a fuckwit cop threaten to call social services when I declined his offer to interview my Daughter regarding an incident she had nothing to do with and had no knowledge of. I was threatened with kidnap of myself too for declining to give my name at the entrance to my own home. The fuckwit cop stepped across the threshold/doorway. I said \"stop right there I do not consent to you entering these premises\" and fuck me it was like garlic to a vampire he actually jumped back. He said \"I'm going to call my Inspector\" I said \"Call your daddy if you like nothing will change\" He radioed his daddy and then fucked off back to his car. His bum fluff faced chum/partner came over from the car and demanded my name. I asked \"Am I obliged by law to give you my name?\" he replied \"Technically no.\" I said \"Technically will do me just fine, goodbye.\" and closed the door in his face. They sat outside in the car for a while writing identical lies in their notebooks no doubt, then fucked off never to be seen again. :-)",
