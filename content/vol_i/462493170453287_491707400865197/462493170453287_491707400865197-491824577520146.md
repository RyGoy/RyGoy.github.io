   "message": "Social Assistance (NOT Employment insurance) is a very touchy thing. You surrender a LOT of rights for the tiny amount of money that is received.\n\nIt actually changes your status when you \"apply\" for social assistance. ALL government money, is MONEY OF ACCOUNT, and when your bank turns it into MONEY OF EXCHANGE, some VERY UGLY legal baggage ALWAYS goes along with it. It will take me WEEK to find it all. This is a VERY hard question. You have NO idea...which is why I answer \"PROBABLY\".\n\n...but now I want to know too. So I'm going to find out.",
