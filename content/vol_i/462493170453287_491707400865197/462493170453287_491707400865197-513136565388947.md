First I admitted MY mistakes.\n2). I apologized.\n3). I agreed on PAYING an Allymoney.\n4). I did my part of the contract.\n5). I did the best I could to make sure my daughter knows I love her.\n6). I did shut-up numerous times on some MINOR stuff.\n7). I made sure to be friendly with my ex new boyfriend.\n8). I even had a meeting with him alone to avoid ANY bullshit.\n9). I accepted the fact that my daughter may need MORE her mother than me.\n10). I minded my own business as much as I could.\n11). I REALLY, HONESTLY, did the best I could.\n12). EVERY case is completely different from one to another.\n13). FOCUS on the well being of the child AT ALL TIME\n14). This apply to Men only, I have no clue about Weman denied of seeing their child by Men.\n\nGood Luck ! :D",
