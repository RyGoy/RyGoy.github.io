   "message": "kiddo:  mama?\n\nmoms:  yes, dear.\n\nkiddo:  what is property?\n\nmoms: that which is exclusive to oneself and no other within a society, honey.\n\nkiddo:  mama, am i exclusive to you and papa?\n\nmoms: yep, but only if we don't make the mistake of identifying you as a warden of the state.  As far as they need be concerned, you're our little bundle of joy, not the state's property.\n\nkiddo: but im not gonna be little for ever, what about when i'm a grown up?\n\nmoms: then you will be old and wise enough to control your own cognitive capacity to determine how you navigate, enjoy and exercise your property; your breath, heartbeat, body, labor/it's fruits and your self determination/liberty.",
