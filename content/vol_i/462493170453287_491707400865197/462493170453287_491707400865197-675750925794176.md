   "message": "Would it be wrong to offer them, in good faith, that if they have an extra copy of that exam or whatever, to send it over to you and you'll gladly evaluate for yourself how above average your kids skills are vs their exam, saying it's important to you that he gets to learn and be tested from and through as many and diverse sources as possible, and it's not your intention to discriminate or ignore any, but clearly stating that they wont get the results, as your kids education is none of their brainwashing business..? You know, i'd still love to get an idea how better my kid would score vs the \"social stupid standard\" he'll eventually have to coexist with ?",
