   "message": "OK!\nSo I got a response from the School Board.\n___________________\n\nMadame Janik Paquette\nMonsieur Jocelyn Rouillier\n\nObject: (child's person name) evaluation - 2013-2014\n______________________________________________________\n\nTo follow up on your communication, we wish to specify that the evaluation session is not a benefit but an obligation. We are reminding you also that this process is clearly stipulated in the homeschooling protocole that you have signed.\n\nAccording to art. 15 of the Law on education (Loi su l'instruction) it's the School Board (Commission Scolaire) that evaluates and determines the exemption you get from Home schooling. You will understand in these circombstances that failure to appear at the selected dates will result in our rejection of your request (demande) for homeschooling next year because we will not have been able to reach a decision (se prononcer) on the education you have (dispenser ...don't know how to translate that word!) at home.\n\nTherefore, failling to submit your child to the evaluation session esthablished, we will assume that it is our duty to inform the proper athorities.\n\nBla,bla,bla without love ! :D",
