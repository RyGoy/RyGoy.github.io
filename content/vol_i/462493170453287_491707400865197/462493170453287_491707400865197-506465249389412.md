   "message": "I knew that on April 9, when I appeared in court there would be another Temporary Care and Custody order coming through. That In the past I had not consented to it. In a number of different ways. Then I learned that it was a MISTAKE TO NOT CONSENT  to it so I sent in my Notice of mistake and begged forgiveness to and requested to decline it. It was almost 2 weeks but here is another Temp. Care and Custody Order. Am I right in assuming that they just by pased me in court on last Tuesday cause I wasn't there (not supposed to be there till June) and had my mistakes withdrawn again and went ahead with the order or is something else going on?",
