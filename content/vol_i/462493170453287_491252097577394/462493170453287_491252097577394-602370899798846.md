   "message": "Scott Duncan \"Would you like to recuse yourself\"? - This always works\n\nThis actually claims your rights, and turfs the Justice.\n\nScott Duncan The second you suspect it; \"Your Honour your conduct has caused me to reasonably believe that you have formed a biased position as regards this matter, and could serve to damage my interests. Would you please recuse yourself\"?\n\n(Note: ending that question with \"..you sanctimonious, worthless parasitic bitch\"? ...is optional.)\n\nDerek Moran Do you have to call-out- \"Point-of-Order\" first, before you say that?\n\nScott Duncan No. In fact this would fall under OBJECTION. You OBJECT to a sanctimonious, worthless parasitic bitch ruling on the matter.\n\nPOINT OF ORDER serves to POINT out an error and/or MISTAKE.\n\nDerek Moran You have mentioned before NOT to MOTION to/with the court, as you are unwittingly consenting to their jurisdiction, Scott?\n\nScott Duncan YES! Martin Sutton almost did that. Darren the cop was all for it. If Darren the cop says it, you probably should try figure out why you shouldn't... RIGHT MARTIN? \n\nEamonn O Brien If a writ is an order of the court on behalf of one party to the other how do you file for the court to issue one? Am I understanding it properly even...?\n\nScott Duncan Praecipe.",
