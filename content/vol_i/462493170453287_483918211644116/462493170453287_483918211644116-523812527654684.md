   "message": "I'm looking at this from the government/state's/clubhouse rules stance...the fact that you have used the BC/driver's licence/SIN etc fulfils their presumption that YOU are acting as a trustee & everything/anything of value you produce becomes trust property (their trust)...because from their point of view you are acting as a government employee/trustee of a trust of which they are the beneficiary (in their eyes)\n\nSo it would be correct in that context that registration transfers no interest because from their point of view, they held the interest all along...\n\nWith registration, you are the party who has added value and you hold equitable title, while legal title is retained by the state (or if the name has been liened into a private trust, the private trust would then become the legal title holder)",
