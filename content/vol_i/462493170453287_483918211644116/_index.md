   "message": "- Property registered to the PERSON -\n\n   I would think that once the property isn't used to cause harm then any interaction between THEM and the PERSON in relation to the property is just an attempt to engage a man/woman as surety for their benefit yes?\n\ni.e. - My car is registered to the PERSON. They own their PERSON but I have control of it. Any contact from them after registration is an offer from them for me to act as trustee and take liability for alleged debts?",
