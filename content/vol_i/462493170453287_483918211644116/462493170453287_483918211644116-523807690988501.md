   "message": "My understanding is that you only ever hold the equitable title to your car house etc entitling you to the revenue of the transfer of ownership and through your licence plate and tax create a presumption  you are the person. On your log book you must first fill in block capitols and then signing with your birth cert name adds more weight to this presumption as it now link's to the birth cert and the social security number. They hold the legal tittle which allows them to tax or inforce the policies upon you as that is the tittle of true ownership (as tittle and ownership are confused as being the same thing) people never rebut those presumptions they stand.  In a trust, one person may own the legal title, such as the trustees. Another may own the equitable title such as the beneficiary. So it is quite similar to the whole \"PERSON\" thing if i have this right i am open to correction of course.",
