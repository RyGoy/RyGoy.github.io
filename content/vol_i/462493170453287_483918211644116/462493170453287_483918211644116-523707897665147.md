   "message": "Those Metaphilm articles are very good... I haven't actually seen the movies but the amount of info in them is great.\n\nMary Croft spoke of the world being bankrupt but didn't I didn't hear her go into the details of bankruptcy... (Maybe she did)\n\nSo in bankruptcy the \"person\" is declared dead so an estate can be established and all goods that are then registered to the \"estate\" are divided amongst the creditors as debt payment rather than being divided amongst family as benefits to beneficiaries... \n\nI remember Scott saying you don't own anything you register... \n\nIs the article accurate in saying that the estate is created based on the death of the afterbirth Scott, as in order to declare one bankrupt they need to be first declared dead?",
