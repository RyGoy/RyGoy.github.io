Giving the security value...\n\nWhen I think of registration I always ponder back to Dean Clifford's words, \"registration transfers no interest in property\"... Yet it clearly does... \n\nCould someone explain titles a bit more clearly... Registration creates a title and it is then split etc... That one still confuses me somewhat...",
