   "message": "Listen to Kate Butler. She had the BEST teacher. Yes Andrew is the best teacher. He has experience, and the SECOND he's asked a question he does not know the answer to, he finds out.\n\nAbove all, he knows when to drag me in to help. :D\n\nSo yes. Listen To Kate.\n\n...she sort of feels like Hitler in Munich right now. She was prepared for a huge fight, in a conflict where she was not in the wrong... and the pussies caved! Just like Munich! :D",
