   "message": "Scott Duncan: The GOVERNMENT is not a PERSON. The COURT is not a PERSON. I won't say I believe you Scott, because we all know how believers are misguided. I will say, because you have continuously demonstrated your authority in these matters, that I TRUST you are correct (ALL RIGHTS RESPECTFULLY RESERVED). However, I have, with my own very own eyes seen the registration of CANADA as a corporation (PERSON), and, I have also seen courts registered as PERSONS. Please help us understand how these entities which are registered as PERSONS are not persons. Thanks in advance! PS Please don't ban me because I questioned your statements. Thanks again!
