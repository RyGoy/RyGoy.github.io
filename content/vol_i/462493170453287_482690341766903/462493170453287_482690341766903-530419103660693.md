   "message": "Scott- you have made a point of explaining the significance of making something PUBLIC RECORD. However, in the case of posting PUBLIC NOTICE on the internet or a classifieds-section, why would THEY (lets take the City of Toronto for example) give a shit. What is it about PUBLIC NOTICE exactly that would even make the City blink and possibly go- \"UH-OH, he posted a PUBLIC NOTICE, we're in for it now...\" Just WHAT exactly makes PUBLIC NOTICE so effective, and why would ANY government-agency fear it from us? Thank you.",
