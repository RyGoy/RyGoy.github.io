I get back from being away and tell him- \"If you dont rebut their claim, it will stand that you tacitly-agreed they were right...Well, what do we do then son?...Good question, dad- you need to send back a NOTICE of your own informing them what a by-law is, who by-laws apply too, and get them to tell you if they consider you to be a City employee...\"",
