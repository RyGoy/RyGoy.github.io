   "message": "Just got here, first thread I read. Interesting group. I'll be patient with you. I am learned... so I ask...\n\nWhen I notice you and you notice me back, what's the next logical progression of this exchange?\n\nAnother notice. And after that... another notice. And a notice begets another and another and another. Until the never ending myriad of circle jerk noticing, ends. Right?\n\nOr is there some other definitive means, to stop the simple REPLY from being the \"stall tactic\"?",
