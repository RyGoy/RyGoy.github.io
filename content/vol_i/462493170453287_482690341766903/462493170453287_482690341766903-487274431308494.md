   "message": "Derek Moran, I would probably insist that it be signed accepting full commercial liability & under penalty of perjury, after 30 days, send them a fault notice & another 10 days to rebut, then default notice them & give them 7 days to rebut...eg: 'If there has been no response within 30 days from the date of this notice, rebutting point for point, signed under full commercial liability & penalty of perjury, that will be accepted as tacit agreement that no contract or obligation exists between the parties in question'.....if they pursue it after you default them, swear up an affidavit stating the facts that there is no controversy as there is agreement between the parties that no  contract and hence no obligation exists...that should put it to bed",
