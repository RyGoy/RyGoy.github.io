   "message": "Point ï¿½these people are supposed to work for US. They use their TITLES as an excuse to what? Be our authority? I had a business matter wherein a freight company dropped my freight. If I called them and said, \"Ok, you have damaged my property, I need to be reimbursed....\" Would they not come up with an answer and if not, would me calling as Scott did not require an immediate answer? I have done this and they do want to get to a resolve with you... why does this not work with government? They want to wallow away? Seriously?",
