   "message": "Scott Duncan: \"PROPER NOTICE IS disclosure. Before the sign \"keep off the grass\" was put there, no INTENT was disclosed.\" \n\nI think I get it (at least a bit). \n\nWithout PUBLIC disclosure of my SOULï¿½S INTENT, through the POST OFFICE, any *&^%$#@ ***redacted shit here*** asshole, can assume my VESSEL is available to contract and may even be abandoned and ready to be salvaged, or, worse yet, disassembled and PRONOUNCED DEAD/KILLED on their log? \n\nIt is time for me to read the TRUST thread several more times. And then again and again.  \n\nI am starting to feel like a Swashbuckler that can finally put down the sword and win the battle on land through my WORD/LAW and my PROPER NOTICE. And how simply and beautifully easy it is; by using the POST I can create my LAW. LOL \n\nThis is fun! Thanks for breaking that down Scott Duncan. \n\nPS\nSwashbucklers on land look a little dumb/silly (especially with their odd garb) if you ask me. \n\nPick up thy mighty pen and CREATE YOUR LAW, as the possibilities abound.",
