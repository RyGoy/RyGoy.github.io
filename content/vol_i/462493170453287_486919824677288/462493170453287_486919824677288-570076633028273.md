   "message": "The Trust (which I direct),The Trustee corp administered via a lien  which states:\nall debts previous and current. It is a net for debt of the legal person who is value less.\nTrustee corp is the court, the administrator of the legal person's debt.... It essentially owns that debt. \nSo by proxy that debt is now trust property that the creditors are now responsible for... the gubbinit.. much like what they do... hmmm\nSo the debt is already created.\nThe question then is How to Exchange the Debt, which is done thru the corp...\nBy what mechanism? 3 Notices to whichever Govt dept then lien the appropriate account... creating Value..\nSo take it one step further and based on reality and what they use to calculate the worth of a person's lifetime and do the same thing. Accounting and Surety.\nOne needs to assess it correct? Scott Duncan \nWho is to rebut- NO ONE.\nAs long as a the legal framework via administrative process is complete.\nAm I correct so far?
