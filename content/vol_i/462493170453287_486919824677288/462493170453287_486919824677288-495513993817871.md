   "message": "I thought bitcoin relies on network connections. How can you build your own internet? I know there are some super intelligent people out there with mad computer skills that can get around just about anything. But what if the creators of the internet (u.s. military I think...) or some psychotic sociopathic \"leader of the free world\" decides the internet is \"bad\" for sheeple and blocks it completely. Bitcoin would then be compromised to about 99% of the users, except for the geniuses that can get through at that point. So sure if things stay as they are Bitcoin is safe. Do you see what I mean? It's not as stable of a medium of exchange as say gold or silver or tobacco or any commodity for that matter... With the current situation on this planet I would just like to make sure folks are aware of that...:)",
