First - Bitcoin currency seems a little too complicated for the average Joe out there to use to buy beer and pay for hookers (if that's what he wants to do). Maybe I'm missing something (very likely). Can someone please elaborate on using bitcoin effectively so even my mother can do it? Second - To answer the question: CAN IT MAKE YOU RICH? I honestly don't know. Can you define \"rich\"? Are we taking about setting up powerful overseas remote servers to \"mine\" this currency?

Third and final question: Please elaborate on using forex in relation to bitcoin.. I have no use for money either but I do need to buy food (whether its legal tender or bitcoin) Let the comments begin....",
