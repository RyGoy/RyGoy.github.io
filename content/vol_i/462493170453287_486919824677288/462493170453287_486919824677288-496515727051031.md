   "message": "Some stores in Montrï¿½al start accepting Bitcoins as payment....is there a lots of these stores...???\nMaybe few people saw my other topic... I got a legit computer retail store (whole custom computers, parts) and Im about to accept bitcoin as currency. \n\nI need just one more thing, a trusted (and quick) source to exchange bitcoins for cash. Because Powercolor and such dosen't accept bitcoins.",
