   "message": "\"The phrases from the above quotation which require elaboration in relation to the content and effect of orders in council are \"rule of conduct\", \"force of law\" and \"an undetermined number of persons\".  A \"rule of conduct\" can be described as a rule which sets norms or standards of conduct, which determine the manner in which rights are exercised and responsibilities are fulfilled.  Pairing this with the phrase \"force of law\", the rule must be unilateral and have binding legal effect.  Finally, it must also apply to \"an undetermined number of PERSONS\", that is, it must be of general application rather than directed at specific individuals or situations.\"\n\nhttp://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=consent%2C+force+of+law&language=en&searchTitle=Canada+%28Federal%29+-+Supreme+Court+of+Canada&path=/en/ca/scc/doc/1992/1992canlii115/1992canlii115.html&searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAVY29uc2VudCwgZm9yY2Ugb2YgbGF3AAAAAAAAAQ",
