   "message": "i am following. I know that the Sovereign Conference was discussing bitcoin this week, in South America i think. I find it very interesting......as Max Keiser also announced this week that it's TOO late....to jump in, and I also heard people already w bitcoin would be getting money? for them? something like that.
