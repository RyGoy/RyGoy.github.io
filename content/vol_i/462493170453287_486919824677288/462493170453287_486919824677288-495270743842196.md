   "message": "Bitcoins are good to a point. I was just listening to a program that brought up the fact that \"bitcoin\" doesn't control the internet but bitcoin is purely based on the internet. I am not sure if you are aware of that hacker who has essentially (illegally) mapped the internet, so that being the case how secure can bitcoin really be. If control of the internet becomes regulated or certain powers just \"shut'er down\" over \"national security\" concerns... That being said, imagine the effects of another Carrington type of event happening ... TOMORROW!! I know the gold /silver paradigm as well, but best not have all the eggs in one basket.",
