   "message": "it's more than doubled again, $88.US people are asking nearly a hundred per BTC for sale. the problem, is that converting dollars to bitcoin creates an intention. lets hope that island is 'allowed' to function on BTC trading as a currency bartered for consumeables. they can open up one cashier lane with the ability to accept BTC at it's market rate, and at the same time why not add silver bullion at spot.\n\nyou just do the math at spot, and the sales cash/register machine converts it into dollars for the record. change is only given in brass dollars (only rediemable at a scrap yard for spot into BTC).",
