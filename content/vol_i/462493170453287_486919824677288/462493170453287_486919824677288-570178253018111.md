   "message": "Fuck.\nThis thread used to have way more on it.... I know its been deshitified...\nSo if we cut them off from the legal person... \nStopping them from creating anymore debt. This will stop them if enough people catch on.\nMoney of exchange is needed when you spend it.  Thru the trust we create credit with our signature.\nThe govt borrowed from the banks in with the legal person as collateral.\nWe stop them from doing that.\nAnd we prevent the debt being repaid as the trustee corp is first in line... \nso its more like debt transfer.\nso we can discharge this debt or settle it.... by various methods.\nI learn all this to find out  it is  valuing the wrong things.... \nSeriously confused now.\nWhat am I missing?
