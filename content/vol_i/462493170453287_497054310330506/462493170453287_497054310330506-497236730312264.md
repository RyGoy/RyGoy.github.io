If you want me to show off, I can deploy a copy of Big Blue Button, with a 1 800 dial-in (with recording and video) from my boat... Yes, I can say that...MY BOAT, MOTHERFUCKERS! :P\n\nSo, ya, I might do that, just because I'm awesome... And then shut it down because it's mine and it costs money to run these things... Because Fuck off, that's why :P",
