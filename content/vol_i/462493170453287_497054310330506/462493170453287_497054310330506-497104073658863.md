   "message": "Ok, last time. ALL CORPORATIONS ARE PERSONS, but ALL PERSONS ARE NOT CORPORATIONS. A \"birth certificate\" means there is a SECURITY, not a CORPORATION.\n\nYou don't vote at shareholder meetings.\n\nYou don't have a \"first director\", nor do you have a \"president\". You have a PERSON which is A SECURITY, NOT A CORPORATION. PLEASE stop saying that it IS.\n\nIt misleads people and they will miss key points.\n\nSO SAY IT WITH ME:\n\nA PERSON IS NOT A CORPORATION!|\n\nA CORPORATION CAN BE A PERSON. THAT IS ALL AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR \"PERSON\".\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nSTOP SAYING A PERSON IS A CORPORATION!\n\nTL:DR\n\nSTOP SAYING A PERSON IS A CORPORATION!\n\nP.S.\n\nSTOP SAYING A PERSON IS A CORPORATION!",
