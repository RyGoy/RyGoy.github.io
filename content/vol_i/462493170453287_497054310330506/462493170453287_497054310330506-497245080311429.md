   "message": "David Johansen, you don't \"register yourself\" as a corporation. You also don't OWN a corporation (That would be SLAVERY).\n\nYou CREATE a corporation, then grant ONE SHARE. You are now the SOLE SHAREHOLDER (not an \"owner\"). You then ORDER (from the corporation, for which you are the CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER to LIEN your BIRTH CERTIFICATE. The corporation can then hold that asset IN TRUST.\n\nWhen you say \"...register myself in full name as a corporation\", you reveal a PROFOUND ignorance as to what a CORPORATION IS! You have no CLUE. Stop pulling answers out of your ass, and RESEARCH THESE WORDS, because, as I countless times, have said, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE WORDS MEAN. Pretending you DO helps NOBODY.",
