   "message": "I see what you refer to, Scott. Attempting to answer to Gail her question, I tried using a comparison of the concept of contracts between corporations, and persons, and I placed in parenthesis  the word (corporation) by the word person, causing confusion, as if I meant that person is equal to corporation. So I again apologize, if this caused a mistake that could be equated to bullshit.",
