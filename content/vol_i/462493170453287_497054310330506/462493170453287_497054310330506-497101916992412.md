   "message": "Now, that same concept I just mentioned about corporations, contracts, and Law, applies to YOUR PERSONS. All persons are created equal under the Law. But, the living MAN DOES NOT EXIST IN THEIR FICTION WORLD. Just your person its what is RECOGNIZED under the Law. Unless you BELIEVE this applies to the MAN. And the NOTICE OF MISTAKE lets that cat out of the bag, big time. So, if everything is CONTRACT, Pierre, where is your VALID CONTRACT saying you agree to, not only perform for FREE, but PAYING with your taxes, accepting, lets say... The Criminal Code Of Canada? Were you offered a contract, and you accepted it, any meeting of the minds, signing YOUR LIFE AWAY? Im am just trying to create a lawfull neurological revolution. Anything imposed by force, is SLAVERY. And that can only happen, BY WHICH AUTHORITY? By YOUR OWN AUTORITY, with your own CONSENT. Because, NO MAN has been vested power over other MANl, unless you CONSENT to such averation. And even in their own laws, that were created by MEN, there has to be a valid contract. Anything other than that is slavery, involuntary servitude, and all that good stuff.",
