Do you know that what you are trying to do its called FRAUD? BY WHICH AUTHORITY are you dealing with a matter pertaining exclusively to (name of your corporation). I COMMAND you to never contact (name of your corp) again, you have been warned. Pierre. CEO. Corporate seal. Nothing more, nothing less. Registered mail, via certificate of service. I hope this helps!",
