   "message": "I'll put my 20 cents, Gail. Because this is the Tender for Law, lets talk Law. All persons (corporations) are created equal under the LAW. No corporation has more power than another.... Unless one of the 2 parties CONSENTS to such averation. So 2 corporations want to do \"business\", how do they establish that? Via a CONTRACT! So 1st for that contract to be valid, it must contain all the goodies of offer, acceptance, meeting of the minds, consideration, and those. Then that contract will say that, if a breach to the agreement occurs, how and in what way it will be solved. So, it will probably say that if 1 party breaches contract, party 2 may take party 1 for breach of contract, or whatever, to court. It has to mention which laws will bound that contract. International maritime? Federal? Statutory? Corporate law? Whichever the 2 parties agree. Now, what happens when 2 companies DO NOT have a contract? No one corporation could possibly CLAIM ANYTHING, because THERE IS NO CONTRACT. So that is why in the case of Pierre he can/must act with such authority. The collection company has NO business claiming crap, UNLESS somehow Pierre BELIEVES they somehow could meddle in a private corporate matter.",
