   "message": "I usually get Famous Players movie-CERTIFICATES from some family member inevitably every year at Christmas. One thing ive noticed about them...is that if, you say, forget about them cuz they get covered-up by stuff in your room..you will never end-up getting the VALUE from out of it it was intended to give to you, and instead of getting to see a movie for FREE...you end-up still paying to go see the movie with your LEGAL TENDER instead- why?.....because...you forgot all about the CERTIFICATE you were given at Christmas as a PRESENT meant to BENEFITciary you..only because you didnt listen to your mom and keep a tidy-room as a kid growing-up",
