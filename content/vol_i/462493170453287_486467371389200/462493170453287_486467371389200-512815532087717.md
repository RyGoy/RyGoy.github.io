   "message": "what we covered in my Torts-and-Contracts class textbook tonight:\n\nIn most circumstances, the courts will not enforce GRATUITOUS PROMISES. Because they lack consideration, gratuitous promises are not contracts. However, there are some exceptions to the rule. A gratuitous promise that is made UNDER SEAL will be ENFORCED even without consideration. A document under seal is called a DEED. A DEED is a written contract, made UNDER SEAL by the PROMISOR(S); also called a formal contract. A promise made UNDER SEAL does not require CONSIDERATION to make it BINDING. The courts have traditionally viewed the seal on a document as an indication that the promisor understands the significance of his or her act and intends to be BOUND by the promise contained in the document. \n\n..so- i wonder what it was the Registrar General of Ontario Robert Welch at the time i was born promised me, exactly? :/  ;)",
