   "message": "When a document of tittle is required, tittle passes to the buyer when and were the document is delivered. Thus, if the goods are stored in a warehouse, tittle passes to the buyer when the appropriate documents are delivered to the buyer. The goods never move. In fact, the buyer can choose to leave the goods at the same warehouse for a period of time, and the buyers tittle to the goods will be unaffected.",
