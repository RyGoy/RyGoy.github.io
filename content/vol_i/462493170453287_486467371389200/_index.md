   "message": "The \"BILL OF LADING\" thread! - Black's Law Dictionary, 8th-edition:\n\nA document acknowledging a RECEIPT of goods by a carrier or by the shipper's agent and the contract for the transportation of those goods; a document that indicates the receipt of goods for shipment and that is issued by a person engaged in the business of transporting or forwarding goods. A negotiable bill of lading is a document of title.\n\n\"A bill of lading may be regarded in three several aspects. (1) Its is the receipt given by the MASTER(??) of a SHIP acknowledging that the goods specified in the bill have been put on BOARD(the citizenSHIP); (2) it is the document that contains the terms of the contract for the carriage of the goods agreed upon between the shipper of the goods and the shipowner (whose agent the master of the ship is); and (3) it is a 'document of title' to the goods, of which it is the symbol. It is by means of this document of title that the goods themselves may be dealt with by the OWNER of them while they are still on board SHIP and upon the high seas(subject to ADMIRALTY/MARITIME law?)\"  Principles of the Law of Contract (1919)\n\npick your choice of Bill of Lading: bearer.. claused.. clean.. destination.. foul..
