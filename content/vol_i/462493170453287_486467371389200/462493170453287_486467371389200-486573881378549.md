   "message": "I have a Tenants agreement with the Queen since  2010.Obtained through  acquiescence ! 3 months later I did receive a letter from the Queen. Telling me she is a constitutional Sovereign, Her Majesty acts through her personal Representative, the Governor-General and had forwarded my documents to the same so she may be aware of my approach to the Queen and consider the points I had raised, Which is of course my tenants agreement... I gave her Majesty  $20 in consideration ! which  her Majesty  has taken, :) . Now since the Lawyer fraudulently  foreclosed on me I think I should write the Governor-General  ????",
