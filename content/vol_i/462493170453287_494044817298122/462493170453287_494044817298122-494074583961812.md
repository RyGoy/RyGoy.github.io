So, I applied for this number. I never taught that by applying for the number, I would apply for an office/function/title of a taxpayer, and, I never presumed that from that moment I would start to work for the government.\n\nThe government never gave me any informations or Formation on this matter, so, here are the missing informations. On all the documents you�ve sent me so far, it is clearly indicate that I have an  office/function/title of a taxpayer with your company.\n\nSo, I need to receive these informations to really understand / Administrate and terminate PIERRE DAOUST�s file / account no. 261-XXX-XXX\n\n1). The date you start presume that I work for the government.\n2). Proof of Hireing.\n3). Complete address of my office\n4). Who hired me\n5). Complete account statment concerning my PERSON PIERRE DAOUST 261-XXX-XXX since the first day you presume that I�m working for you\n6). What I have done to deserve this office/function/title\n7). Proof of remuneration\n\nI think that with all these informations, i twill be easy to close the file\nI beleive that I owe this due dilligence to my person to make sure I�m not being robbed and/or fraud or kept in slavery\n\nIf ever you�ve made a mistake on the PERSON, its not too late to rectify the mistake.\nOn my side, I will activly continu my education to discover the whole truth to make sure that my PERSON wont face these kind of mistakes, if mistakes there is.\n\nThere is a lot to learn and I�m at the beginning of it\n\nMy sources : \nD�CLARATION UNIVERSELLE DES DROITS DE L�HOMME, D�CLARATION CANADIENNE DES DROITS, CHARTE CANADIENNE DES DROITS ET LIBERT�S, CHARTE QU�BECOISE DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE, CONVENTION AM�RICAINE RELATIVE AUX DROITS DE L�HOMME, PACTE INTERNATIONAL RELATIF AUX DROITS �CONOMIQUES, SOCIAUX ET CULTURELS.\n\nCONVERSATION AVEC L�ORGANISATION DES NATIONS-UNIES, DEMANDE D�INFORMATION AU MINISTRE DU PATRIMOINE.\n\nCODE CIVILE DU QU�BEC, DIRECTEUR DE L��TAT CIVIL DU QU�BEC, SANT� ET SERVICES SOCIAUX DU QU�BEC, AVOCATS, PLUSIEURS SOURCES PRIV�ES, VOTRE LOI SUR LES IMP�TS ET AUTRES�\n\nMy intentions, FOR NOW, are :\n\nProceed with my life, knowing the truth and continuing my 4 children�s education\n\nI need an answer from you within 30 days\n\nAnd again, happy holidays and wish you the best for 2013\n\nAvec Respect, Honneur, Dignit� et Int�grit�\n\n____________________________________\n\nJoseph-Pierre Gilles\nMaitre de PIERRE DAOUST 261-XXX-XXX\nXXXX rue Latrolle\nMirabel (Qu�bec) Canada\nJ7X-XXX",
