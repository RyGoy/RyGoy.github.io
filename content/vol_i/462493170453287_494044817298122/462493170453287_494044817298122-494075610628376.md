   "message": "Maybe take PIERRE DAOUST in next time (the Birth Certificate/PERSON), and as sole living beneficiary, Joseph Pierre Gilles is a party in interest and, as a friend of the court, Joseph Pierre Gilles requests an opportunity to assist the court and request from the tax department the evidence to back their claim...\n\nInform the court you keep asking PIERRE DAOUST for the information the court/other side requests but  this PERSON wont/can't give it to you (after all PIERRE DAOUST can't do anything as it's a dead entity)...then you can make your sexy belligerent claim & that as MASTER & sole decision maker for PIERRE DAOUST, you are aware of no contract that exists between PIERRE DAOUST & the claimant & believe that none exists...swear up an affidavit to that effect & have the other side rebut it ;-)  \n\nThat's my 'top of my head/out of my arse' response...maybe Scott Duncan can shoot it to pieces/tidy it up as appropriate ;-)  Best wishes Pierre & let us all know how it goes",
