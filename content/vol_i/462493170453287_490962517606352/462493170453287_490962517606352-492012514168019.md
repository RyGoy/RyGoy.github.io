   "message": "Pierre, there WAS no English back then. They wrote it in Latin because that is what the only people that could read or write KNEW. Keep following insanity, let me know how it goes. So....was that ignorance or a lie...that \"Germanic influence on the language of the Angols resulted in the English written in the MAGNA CARTA?\"...being a document written in LATIN!  Maybe I should mouth off now, and talk shit, and demand to know whether that, among every other glaring error on that post was ignorance or a lie. WHY ARE YOU LYING SCOTT......WHY ARE YOU LYING!?!?!?!?!?!?!   HEY EVERYONE, LOOK HOW OBNOXIOUS IN A NON WITTY MANNER I CAN BE!!!!!!!! \n\nGood grief....",
