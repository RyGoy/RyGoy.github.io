   "message": "<<1: Establish a trust\n2: Establish a corporation - In the Charter, assign the role of the corporation to HOLD the trust, and establish the \"Law\" guidelines (You get to make your own up) as regards keeping the trust.\n3: Get ANY accountant to manage the books of the corporation. You direct the corporation as FIRST DIRECTOR, and establish roles (President/CEO Vice President, etc) which is how the UNITED STATES was formed. \n \nSide Note: EVER NOTICE that when the US \"Liberates\" a country, they NEVER install their form of government? It's always a PARLIAMENT they install. Figure out why that is, and things will be clearer. USE THE U.S. AS A MODEL FOR YOUR CORPORATION.\n \n... No YOU do that. The accountant EXECUTES YOUR TASKS within the framework. To establish a trust, write it down, and have it witnessed and notarized. The end. Only shareholders of your corporation are recognized by the trust.\n \nStop letting OTHERS define YOUR trust/claim. Call it Le Trust DuPierre, for all I care. IT'S YOURS and your CORPORATION'S.>>  Scott's gold nuggets",
