   "message": "what does the queen  have to do with this she has no authority Statute of West Minister took care of that in 1931 .........But before that all Governor generals were British appointees after enactment Mackenzie King appointed the first Canadian to the position to give the impression that we were some how still tied to the monarchy .............Victoria and Elizabeth have no power they never did so the crown they refer to in court is a fraud if they are referring to the queen",
