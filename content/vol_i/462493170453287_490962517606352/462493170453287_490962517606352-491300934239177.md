   "message": "In my experience which is limited, form is everything to these twats. There is a Maxim which says that substance takes precedence over form but they ignore that fact. Unless I guess you raise that Maxim. A friend and I were denied our defence by a Sheriff (Scottish Judge) who said \"You may have a very good defence but it must be in the proper form, fuck off and get a lawyer\" meaning there way of presenting it on paper. In other words our legalese was shit. I would have fought him on that but my buddy was doing the talking, or not as the case may be because his rectum started chomping button holes in his shirt tail at the first sign of testing from the bench and he choked :-)",
