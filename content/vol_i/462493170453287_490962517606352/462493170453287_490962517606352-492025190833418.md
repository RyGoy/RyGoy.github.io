   "message": "MAGNA CARTA was written in LATIN, Vernacular French, Gaelic, and Angol. Fuck off Dean Clifford.\n\nMAGNA CARTA LIBERTATUM Latin, Gaelic and Angol. Yes there was no \"English back then\". English evolved through the ANGOLS and Germanic influence to create the language you speak today. EVERY TRANSLATION OF MAGNA CARTA resulted in the translation we see today. Readable, NO \"U\"'s and Not backward like Shakespeare. Containing NO WORDS like Shakespearian Speech, and since LIBERTATUM was the basis for ENGLISH law The FIRST English version was as I said.\n\nNow let's talk about how you are lying about APPLICATIONS and MOTIONS not bringing you into jurisdiction. I notice you don't touch on that.",
