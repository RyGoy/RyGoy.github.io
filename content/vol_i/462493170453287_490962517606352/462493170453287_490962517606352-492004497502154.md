   "message": "Along with other glaring holes in much of what I just had the misfortune to read, I would like to point out that contrary to this particularly interesting statement by Scott: \"Germanic influence on the language of the Angols resulted in the English written in the MAGNA CARTA.\"....I will only point out that the Magna Carta was written in Latin, and the English Language did not exist at all at this point, and did not become a unified language until the very late 1500's and early 1600's. Now, was that ignorance....a lie, or both? \n\nIt's about as accurate, however, as most of the things I just read in this article. For the people who want to follow this path.....enjoy. :)",
