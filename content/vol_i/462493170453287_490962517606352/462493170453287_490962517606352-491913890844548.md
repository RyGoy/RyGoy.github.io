A conviction of the truth of a proposition, existing subjectively in the mind, and induced \nby argument, persuasion, or proof addressed to the judgment.\nKeller v. State, 102 Ga. 506, 31 S.E. 92\nLatrobe v. J. H. Cross Co., D.C.Pa., 29 F.2d 210, \n212. A conclusion arrived at from external sources \nafter weighing probability. Ex parte State exrel. Attorney General, 100 So. 312, 313, 211 Ala. 1.\n\nWhat immediately sticks out in my mind is the 'existing subjectively in the mind' part, by introducing subjectivity, should be grounds to recuse a judge/justice etc, especially when we only want to deal with objective facts & truth",
