   "message": "Coming soon. MAGNA CARTA FOR DUMMIES. It is the ONLY surviving LEGAL document relevant to TODAY. You know...where we live? Where we are, and where APPLICATIONS (begging) and MOTIONS (which only a PARTY can file) Bring you into jurisdiction. The first English translations of the MAGNA CARTA (and the Bible) appeared in 1380 (although there are reportedly earlier ones). And yes there was English in the 1380s. I was referring to the source documents which appeared in the 1200s. It was NOT translated into \"Shakespearean\" English...because that is when Legalese was inserted. History was REWRITTEN in the 1500s and few historic documents can be relied on.\n\nNONE of which has ANYTHING to do with you LYING ABOUT APPLICATIONS AND MOTIONS.",
