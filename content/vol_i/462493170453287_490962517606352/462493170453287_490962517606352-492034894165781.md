   "message": "LAYMEN TERMS \"They\", the controllers of THEIR legal language (to which most of us have ignorantly bound ourselves to), have effectively turned the world into a stage, in which we are merely players. If we can control the stage, through understanding their language (or defining our own as \"They\" do, we can EFFECTIVELY become the DIRECTOR of the play which which \"They\" created AND became the SURETY for AND we can create our own definitions which EXCLUDE their nonsense. \"They\" accepted SURETY for \"their\" language when they affixed their signature AND/OR  PRESENTED a verbal OATH to accept their OFFICE. It's beginning to APPEAR that this language which \"They\" have perverted for their own means is akin to a game of tag. In their game of tag, instead of being vaguely \"it\", the person who is \"it\" (read the ID-I-\"IT\" who took on the SURETY) quickly wants to tag someone else so that the SURETY is no longer theirs. That is the lot of those that will bound by the game and don't make a game that he AND/OR she would like to play. The game of tag \"They\" made is designed to have us to publicly \"perform\" the role of  ignoramus AND SURETY. Feedback Scott? Am I waking up a tad with this Layman's synopsis?",
