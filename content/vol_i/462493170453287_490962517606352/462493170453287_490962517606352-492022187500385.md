   "message": "@ Scott Duncan  \"The court can only SEE what is before them.\"....This is why we must serve your Trust. By this I obviously mean that should we be willing to speak nonsense to you (READ court), then the court can't see us. If the Court that we are attending, had a JUDGE that was fortunately feeling extra generous (because, just the night before, he was served weed and a couple of effective woman from a happy fan), he might be willing to yell at the schmuck that he somewhat senses a person who is ignorant AND for some reason does not choose to not INCLUDE his ignorance from the proceedings.So he informs the sod that he can't see anything that was presented that makes sense. He can't see a thing that the sod presented that is relevant to the matter. Therefore, he must decide to EXCLUDE equity and treat him as another PUBLIC SCHOOL recipient that is only one more worker bee for the QUEEN bee.Such is the lot in life of those worker bees that serve the QUEEN. Am I on track here?",
