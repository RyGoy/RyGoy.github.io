   "message": "If ANYBODY had actually paid attention to the info that dean provided way back when in his first videos, and did THEIR OWN research to cross reference EVERYTHING they have heard during ALL of dean's interviews henceforth, then EVERYONE would have realized that dean was just giving PIECES of the puzzle to this whole \"law/freedom/rights\" thing without giving the ENTIRE picture away, so that the People going after the TRUTH and the KNOWLEDGE would find it, while at the same time, filter out the \"SHEEPLE\" who just follow EVERYTHING that ANYBODY says. \n\nHe promotes DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, and RIGHTFULLY so. Scott Duncan, I feel, knew this the whole time, as he even tried to get the \"followers\" to question in the past, and I quote, \"Why is dean lying?\"\n\nIf YOU do not UNDERSTAND, then usufruct.",
