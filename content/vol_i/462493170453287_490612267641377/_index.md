   "message": "I need to make something very clear here.\n\nOf late I have been approached by several parties asking me for analysis, to join groups, etc., because they seem to think that I'm good at this whole \"articling\" thing...and really I can hardly blame them.  But here's the problem...\n\nAll of these requests are based on the presumption that I have some sort of altruism, and that I'm doing this out of the goodness of my heart, or to share or to enlighten, or for whatever self-made mythology you've conjured about me.  I assure you that this is not the case.  \n\nI am doing this whole venture because I took an oath, and I was ordered to.  If I take an oath I comply with that oath to the best of my abilities.  When I am ordered to use those abilities to the service of that oath, I do my best to be sure it's perfect...or as close as possible.\n\nI don't do this because I think you deserve it.  I don't do this because I like you.  In fact, if all of you were to die horribly and painfully tomorrow I would give not a single fuck.\n\nLet's point my Care Factor Meter at the thought of your universal demise E[\\......]F.\n\nSee?  Care Factor = 0.  I have absolutely no fucks to give about the thought of your demise.\n\nI really hope that's clear.  I'm not your friend.  I don't even like you.  In fact I would really like it if you were taken by one of these \"Gurus\".  I would like to see you hauled into court, and I would like to watch you get your ass kicked.  This thought amuses me, but I'll return here to reality, where I still don't give a shit if you all die.\n\nPlease stop thinking I am some potential shill for your causes.  I answer your questions because I was ordered to...nothing more.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding these orders, you can save us both a lot of time and aggravation by assuming I will answer, \"None of your Fucking Business!\"",
