   "message": "Say...this thread reminds me of my vacation in Spain.  I called my family to let them know I was OK.  I stressed the call was costing a bizillion dollars a minute so I needed to be brief.  My mother told me a nice long story about a ground-hog living under the front porch.  Eventually I cut her off.  She didn't call me a coward though...so I guess I dodged a bullet there :)",
