   "message": "The case and any securities it passes may be fraud. It doesn't matter, the transactions at the jail are complete! Counterfeit Money has the same value, as it's real counterpart...until it's detected!\n\nThe problem is, that it passed through HUNDREDS of transactions before it was detected!\n\nIf you bought cigarettes with a fake $10 bill that you did not detect as fake, you are not going to cough up a $10 bill to some banker you've never met, just because you MAY have used a fake bill.",
