   "message": "Are some of you people on crack !!! this is a transcript , not all the pages are here and for $60 you wont get them all ....it costs around $500 for a transcript ! Martian did get a deal ... there should be 38 there are only 27...this was not a Court case this was setting dates for the hearing ...and not thinking this is Dean is absurd ...Dean would be sitting in that court room with chains on ...he has to watch his Ps and Qs ..Dean did say the things he wanted just to get it on record before the trial ...if you have never been in Deans position it is not easy ...and I don't care how much you know about the law and what is really going on ..what is happening to Dean is no different that others that would have a criminal charge brought against them.",
