   "message": "Will this work? To Scott Duncan, I am a facebook friend of Dean Clifford. Over the past few months I have learned a lot from Dean, he has been of great VALUE to me because of the things he has indirectly taught me. I am also led to believe that he has been kidnapped, possibly through some sort of \"sting\" operation. It has come to my attention that Dean is part of a TRUST administered by you. It is my understanding that you need to be asked to DO something to help Dean. I would like to ask you to do everything in your power to help Dean.  From a very concerned friend, signed Joel Kinmond.",
