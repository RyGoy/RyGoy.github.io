   "message": "I SMELL A RAT.\n\nI've been saying this for a while, but the rat's getting smellier and I must elaborate.  \n\nI'm currently reading through a transcript of the case management hearing that Jeff was trying to attend on February 15, 2013.  There is somebody they purport to be �MR. CLIFFORD� , and as I read these TRANSCRIPTS I realize that this is not Dean.  There is somebody �acting as Dean�.  Dean does not talk like this.  I know Dean.  He does not trip over his words.\n\nThe Dean I know is very precise in his speech and concise in his phrasing.  That said, the PUBLIC RECORD is replete with Dean Clifford �quotations�.  He appears to be �RESPONDING� to the �TITLE�, �MR. CLIFFORD� while simultaneously denying his status as �MR. CLIFFORD�.\n\nThe words and phrasing that he is using have an air of familiarity to them, like I've read them before...like, you know, in other court transcripts.  \n\nThey took $60.00 from Martin, but did not deliver him a signed copy.  Even though they charged him a bargain price, he still bought an AUTHENTICATED DOCUMENT.  Martin is aware of the contents now, but he most certainly did not receive what he purchased.  \n\nAnybody who has followed my adventures getting transcripts knows beyond any doubt that this is not the way a COURT REPORTER'S OFFICE works in real life.  \n\nWHY did they produce this so fast, and WHY does it so conveniently have Dean answering to �MR CLIFFORD�, when questions are asked?...\n\nSeriously?  Does anybody buy that?\n\nDean is an AQUILAE TRUSTEE.  HE UNDERSTANDS OATHS, FEALTY AND SURETY.  In sort, Dean knows better.  He actually has a clue, and he has experience.\n\nAll of you are a bunch of morons who can't tell their asses from a hole-in-the-ground, and YOU know better!  \n\nThey're trying to convince me that Dean has BREACHED THE TRUST.  I can either RESPOND TO THEM, now that I have KNOWLEDGE of this �TRANSCRIPT� or...\n\nI can take the high road, and let you read through it; and you tell me if you think you are hearing Dean, or if this is just cut-and-paste from other hearings.  Special bonus points for those who can tell me why this is most definitely NOT a COURT TRANSCRIPT!",
