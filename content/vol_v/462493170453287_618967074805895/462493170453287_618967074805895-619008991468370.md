   "message": "\"This is a very serious matter, please send me a bill  so it can be taken care of\"  What I've noticed of myself, looking back is that I've made assumptions that are not to my benefit. I was  so programmed to be the debtor that I automatically resigned myself to the idea I owe and negated to hold requests for money  to a proper process. \"please send me a bill\" and \"who are you\" (especially in the case of liars) are both really awesome requests and using them keeps me from acting on assumptions that may not always be accurate.",
