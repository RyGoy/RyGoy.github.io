   "message": "�We don�t have time for this!� exclaimed a police officer as he shot and killed a psychologically troubled, 90-pound teenage boy who had already been tasered and was pinned down beneath two other officers. The victim, 18-year-old Keith Vidal, was �armed� with a screwdriver at the time of his death.\n\nVidal�s father, Mark Wilsey, had called the police for help when the boy suffered what was described as a psychotic episode on the afternoon of January 5. When the police arrived at the family�s home in Boiling Spring Lakes, North Carolina, they rendered the kind of �help� for which they have become so notorious � repeatedly tasering the troubled young man until one of them simply shot him as a time-saving measure.",
