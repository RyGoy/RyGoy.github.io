   "message": "Well, first things first. I have been watching the Money as Debt Series on YouTube. I actually found the entire series in one go, on my 3rd viewing. I have been taking notes. It doesn't seem logical that we all go back to the gold standard. THAT IS CLEAR.\n\nI do have some questions. I have been reading back in the group as far as I can go. Which happens to be only as far as January 8, 2013.\n\nMembers of the group have been mentioning certain threads, and I am unable to view them, I think they are further back.\n\n1. Scott's \"Proper Notice\" thread \n2. \"How Evil-Children's-Aid Society\" thread by Scott\n3. \"Notice of Mistake\" thread\n4. \"Just In Case\" thread \n5. \"How to lien you court case and the warrant properly\" thread\n\nThese are all threads, I cannot viewï¿½ I was wondering if someone could please tag me in them. Or does anyone have a copy of these threads mentioned above?",
