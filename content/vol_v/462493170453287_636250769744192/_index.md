   "message": "How the Stimulus package works.  (an oldy but goody)\n\nIt's a slow day in the small town of Pumphandle and the streets are deserted. Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody is living on credit.\n\n A tourist visiting the area drives through town, stops at the motel, and lays a $100.00 bill on the desk saying he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs to pick one for the night.  As soon as he walks upstairs, the motel owner grabs the bill and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.\n\n The butcher takes the $100.00 and runs down the street to retire his debt to the pig farmer.  The pig farmer takes the $100.00 and heads off to pay his bill to his supplier, the Co-op.\n\n The guy at the Co-op takes the $100.00 and runs to pay his debt to the local prostitute, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer her \"services\" on credit.\n\nThe hooker rushes to the hotel and pays off her room bill with the hotel owner.\n\nThe hotel proprietor then places the $100 back on the counter so the\ntraveler will not suspect anything\n\nAt that moment the traveler comes down the stairs, states that the rooms\nare not satisfactory, picks up the $100 bill and leaves.\n\nNo one produced anything. No one earned anything.  However, the whole town now thinks that they are out of debt and there is a false atmosphere of optimism and glee.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is how a \"government stimulus package\" works!",
