Where you are wrong is with this statement, \"the block chain won't know what to do with this\" with Ethereum playing notary and all evidence (which can be mathimatically defined) showing the criminal nature of their intent.

Ethereums secure contracts now become notice, that notice is sent with attachment indicating the email has been viewed, in turn that attachment is sent to each node in the network confirming receipt and releasing the public notice. The video is part of the plan (I register/record/save everything, in a file, video, correspondence, EVERYTHING) it proves I am suffering from matters that produce or tend to produce feelings of hostility and ill-will between different classes of persons in Canada.
