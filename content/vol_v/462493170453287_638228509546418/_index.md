   "message": "I wanted to throw an idea in here, and get some feedback. This relates to bills of exchange and lets use a gas bill in the example. GAIL received a bill of exchange from the gas company. A duly authorized trustee corporation is going to administer that debt for her.\n\nThis BOE would be an asset for the corp. Because the gas company has such an issue in dealing with BOE, the corp will send a check to the gas company to cover the debt. \n\nThen the corp will submit the BOE to the Bank of Canada. What I'm not sure about is whether that is done through the mail directly to the B of C or if the corporation can deposit the BOE into their bank account and the bank will process the BOE through the Canadian Payments Act to the Bank of Canada?\n\nIf this was to work, could the corp not be an exchange for others to deal with their B of E hassle free...creating a value for the corp, exchanging a BOE into money of account, reducing the debt, and creating new money?\n\nDoes this make sense?",
