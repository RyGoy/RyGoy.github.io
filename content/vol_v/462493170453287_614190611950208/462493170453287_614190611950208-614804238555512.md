   "message": "Let me explaine the Driver's License Chris Evan....\n\nFirst, this thing is NOT for you, it is meant for the PERSON, you happen to have in your pocket.\n\nIt gives that PERSON, the PRIVILEGE to drive a car.\n\nThe same as you would give a SLAVE the privilege to ride a horse.\n\nThe person is A SLAVE......not you, but the fuck up is that, when you apply for that License, you are admitting BEING the person :(\n\nBut that has to be a MISTAKE, so go get the license, and correct the mistake after, so when these thugs gives a DEBT to that slave, it will be LOGIC for you, to administrate that debt vis that slave's surety !!",
