   "message": "My CHILD SUPPORT THREAD:         per/Pierre \n\nShort version\n\nI was at home cop knocks. I answer he has a warrant/reciept for me. I asked if he had a signed complaint by an injured party. He says No and asks that i come with him. I was so stupid i did. At the jail i reserved all rights they were angry with confusion. Bond out. Court date. I arrived, my turn. I had the NOTICE OF MISTAKE with me. Along with a bunch of freedumbbb documents i didn't know what they meant, I was desperate so I said fuck it. The judge asks me to say my NAME but i didn't I spoke of SURETY for a minute or so and let myself be interrupted. I interrupt back. I asked the Judge who the injured party was she says the the PROSECUTOR was REPRESENTING a state corp.  called family human services or something. I asked for dismissal for LACK of signed complaint. She got angry. Then i pointed out that the PROSECUTOR the judge and the injured party all represented the STATE and that it was an obvious CONFLICT OF INTEREST. She got even more angry. She threatened me with jail bla bla bla. At one point i had to make a decision NOTICE OF MISTAKE or freeeduumbbb document that called them traitors and oath violaters and a bunch of dumb shit. So not knowing what to do I pulled out the NOTICE because it seemed alot safer, and said \" uh I NEED to give this to YOU.\" She ACCEPTED the NOTICE and started reading. She made it probably to the question section before she realized what she was actually reading. As soon as she did REAL-IZE what i gave her she literally threw it at the clerk spouting off about not knowing what a NOTICE OF MISTAKE is.. The CLERK filed it. The judges demeanor changed and she dismissed for LACK OF PROPER NOTICE. Because at some point i yelled i had not been NOTICED of any CHARGES. She made a point to say \" The only reason I'm dismissing this is for lack of proper notice\" but i knew she was full of stain shit! :-) My point is i actually gave the judge NOTICE. I don't advise it and certified mail is probably better but she READ it. She couldn't say she had not READ IT or ACT like she hadn't because it was handed to her with me there. She couldn't ACT like she didn't understand my questions because the NOTICE states the FACTS in the beginning. BAM!!!! \nDISCLOSURE: This is not legal advise. I dont advocate going to court. I was scared and STUPID!!!",
