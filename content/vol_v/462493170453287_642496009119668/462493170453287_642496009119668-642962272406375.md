Scott has used the term Executor, but only to tell us to stay away from that stuff. \n\nIt's hard to detox from the past, if you mingle with people that are STILL in the past. My friends list has gone down from 400+, to 44. Like Pete said, I know myself, and I stay away now from those old influences. There is no \"in between\".\n\nJust sayin'.",
