   "message": "It seems like we are talking more about being a Creditor here now.  Now is probably a good time to clear out FREEDUMB crap stuck in my (and/or our) brain.  \n\nFirst, we know to send BoEs REGISTERED MAIL.  That registered mail number is an internationally recognized number....ie, unique number.  The letter that Pete Daoust and I have used that we are sending with the BoEs, could actually be a document of Title, correct?  This Title, we would use to claim the creation of the funds, yes?  That Title SHOULD be kept by us for a CLAIM....is all this correct?\n\nSecond, a few members here have been discussing the TAX forms necessary to be a Creditor.  It makes sense that one would have to tell the ACCOUNTANTS what the ACCOUNTS are doing.  I think I have seen the Canadians discussing T5008 (?) and in the States, its 1099-OID (I think).  Then I have seen others around discussing IRS form 707 and 709 (again...I think).  Scott Duncan, is this correct?\n\nThird, if we are creating these funds and we are claiming to be the Creditor, someone needs to be the Debtor, yes?  Is there any reason to use a W-9 form (for those who we create the funds for....Beneficiary of a BoE)?\n\nI think that is all in my brain for now......but this could be a good Creditor thread!!",
