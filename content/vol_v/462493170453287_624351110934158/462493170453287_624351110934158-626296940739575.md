YOU are the people I value amongst many. I only desire to be with honest people that will always speak their truth. We all have value both here in cyberworld & in reality.  If people lie then they mean ye harm. I do not like to lie. I lied to Liberty,  just recently &  this is ripping me apart but I had to lie to protect her from the harshness of suicide. I want to  tell her but I think I'll wait until she's a lot older. Maybe by then her memory of my mate Clive, will have diminished in her mind. It will never leave me",
