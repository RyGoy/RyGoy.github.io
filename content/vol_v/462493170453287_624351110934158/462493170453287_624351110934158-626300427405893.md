   "message": "Thanks too Chris....I feel slightly awkward. ...I could always communicate but it's just my aussie lingo is a hard thing to grasp in most minds from overseas...& the aussie humour is a weird thing too as no taste buds are required.  I've created a lot of kuntroversey by me using profanities to get my truth known. It annoys most people when I swear but here's the thing that upsets me most is people are more inclined to attack a person that dispells their version of truth but if ye use cuss words then you're bad mmkkaayy. ....& bad people swear a lot. But ask them why do they accept evil laws they will deflect it upon  you....like Duhricks do. :-D",
