   "message": "FFS... you guys are missing something that was blatantly given in the beginning of this group:\n\nScott Duncan: Your Birth Certificate is a BOND (a different type of security) and that means there is ALWAYS LEGAL OBLIGATION ATTACHED TO IT.\n\nDevolving a security to a single party means THAT SINGLE PARTY IS LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO ASSUME LIABILITY FOR THE BOND. That's what makes it a BOND.\n\nREALITY doesn't care why any of you believe.\n\nThe SAFE and PROPER method is to DETACH YOURSELF FROM IT ALTOGETHER and DAMAGE THE SECURITY. You do this by LIENING the bond and making the GOVERNMENT the Copyholder (Send a notarized copy). This gives you first right of refusal, and the ability to pass the debt to the government, BY DEFAULT. In EVERY matter the government must show that they aren't liable... and only a PARTY has the right to speak to legal matters.... and only a PERSON can be a party.\n\nThe NAME is secured, and you get everything.
