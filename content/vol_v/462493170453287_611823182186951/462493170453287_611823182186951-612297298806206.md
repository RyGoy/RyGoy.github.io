   "message": "We have made a mistake:\nThe mistake was talking out of our ass's about the opening a corporate account and utilizing it as the exchange, that was the mistake� \nWe have left numerous shit stains around this issue, confusing things, that was not our intent.\nThe correct method is to assign everything to be used at the discretion of the board or director's including the personal accounts which become property of the corporation to administrate and create credit from. (charter - covenant) or trust agreements.\nIt really makes it simple� Please pardon  this mistake, I am sorry please forgive me.\n We corrected it as soon we as we could based on recent actions taken.\n-The Board of Directors",
