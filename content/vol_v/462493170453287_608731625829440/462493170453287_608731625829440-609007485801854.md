   "message": "Profound as usual.  \n\nFurther to your point, I became disenchanted with the name calling and ad hominem attacks years ago.   The fact that it continues to this day is both wrong, and highly insulting to Scott, his friends, associates and loved-ones (who would also, by association, be considered to have taken leave of their senses).  The bulemic aspects of human nature that allow people to believe you can shun someone for any number of reasons, and then return days, weeks, years later for free \"enlightenment\" continues to astound.   \n\nThis costs you nothing.  Scott has, as always, devoted his personal time and resources to this initiative. If you merely stand back and watch as he is berated and attacked, you are wasting your time, my time, and enabling the agenda of idiots.  And if you come back, years later, hat in hand, what could you possibly have to offer in return?\n\nLead, follow or get out of our way is a bit too much like the plot of Idiocracy.  For the 300th time, lead, follow, or get the fuck behind him and push.  If you can't manage that, I have a button here that will help you get out of our way.",
