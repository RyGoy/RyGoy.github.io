   "message": "I am on CANADA, Scott declares Delaware the haven for a great place to Incorporate.  I not only would like to have the Corporation become the trustee of the private trust which will then Administrate the lien.  I would also like to run a small construction endeavor through it.  I have seen that in order to do this a \"branch\" application has to be made to do such in the province of operation.  Seems like an added expence, as well it is subjected to Canada's corporate laws, just seems easier and less costly to start in Canada.  Is the Court of Chancery in Delaware worth the added costs and administration.  If you know about this I sure could use some advise. Also, I hardly make enough per year to feed the people in my family, taxes are not really a concern at this point.",
