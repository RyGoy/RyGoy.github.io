   "message": "Question:  Who would be the most appropriate party to have NOTICE: that the carrier has delivered the Name to the  Beneficiary, and that the Beneficiary and/or Sole Administrator is rescinding the PERSON from public commerce (as soon as he ,(sui juris), gets a few more enemas) .  The Administrator for the PERSON and/or The carrier requires payment for services rendered: if this payment (fuckin huge, you know for all the trouble!) cant be \"paid\" (of course it can't)  a commercial lien shall follow.  I am \"leaning\"(play on words here) towards the registrar general, in the province of issue?  Would a \"notice to agent is notice to principle, notice to principal is notice to agent\" cover that angle of this getting to the proper party?  (or am i ,like totally, being retarded here?)",
