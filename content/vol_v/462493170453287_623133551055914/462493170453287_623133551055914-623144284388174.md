It just hasn't arrived yet. \nYou don't know that YOU own the CARGO. If you OWN the cargo you are transporting you are no longer in commerce. You are transporting PROPERTY.\nThe NAME is the CARGO, and the BIRTH CERTIFICATE is the BILL OF LADING. It's valueless on it's own. Hence the term \"Sold a bill of goods\".\nOk, got it so far (I think)...so when you lien the name, are you doing it because you haven't been paid for transport/carriage of the goods? You are letting the world know that the cargo is in fact YOURS. Nobody has the right to presume your cargo is for commerce now. That is ALL a Lien is. \" SCOTT DUNCAN.
