   "message": "How can you say we all took the easy way out Scott Duncan? I'm sure some of us did. I think the programming is so entrenched that even those that \"always knew something was wrong\" often fell for a program designed to throw them back into the loop - thinking that they were in fact doing something different... For example in my younger years I thought it was a \"wesstern world\" problem and left the western world to let those who couldn't see it for what I thought it was make their own decisions in it. That obviously isn't the case. The parasite is in fact GLOBAL.. My reasoning is that I could have stayed in CANADA and got a \"REAL\" job an all that... But I left it all that behind. My life hasn't been easy AT ALL.. :P",
