The function of police officer is incompatible with the functions of bailiff, collection agent or representative of a collection agent, and with functions for which a licence is required under the Private Security Act (chapter S-3.5).\n\nThe function of police officer is also incompatible with the holding of a direct or indirect interest in any business that pursues an activity mentioned in the first paragraph, an activity related to the administration of justice or an activity for which a permit issued by the R�gie des alcools, des courses et des jeux for the consumption of alcohol on the premises is required, with the exception of a restaurant sales permit or a restaurant service permit described in section 28 or 28.1 of the Act respecting liquor permits (chapter P-9.1).\n\nAny contravention of the first paragraph of this section shall entail the immediate suspension without pay of the police officer concerned. If the second paragraph of this section is contravened, and the situation is such that the impartiality or integrity of the police officer concerned may be compromised, the director of police must immediately take whatever steps are necessary with respect to that officer.\n\nIn all cases, the police officer�s situation must be regularized within six months, on pain of dismissal. If the interest devolves by succession or gift, the officer must renounce or dispose of it with dispatch.\n2000, c. 12, s. 117; 2008, c. 10, s. 13; 2006, c. 23, s. 127.\n\nhttp://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/P-13.1",
