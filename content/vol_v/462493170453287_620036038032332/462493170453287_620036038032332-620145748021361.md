   "message": "As I see it, the fiat money is based on a bond. Someone Insured your labor to make $x and from that point you start from a negative number trying to pay back this amount because you are the NAME and are trying to get to $0 owed(but you can't because of interest). If you put it down you start from $0 NOW and build your wealth based on work you have ALREADY done. Those believers are still going to use  the FIAT. They will be in the negative while you are in the positive. When it finally collapses and it is time to collect you will be in the clear because you have already shown intent by ALL of the things we have been taught to do. NOTICE. WE ARE NOT PART OF YOUR SYSTEM. We have currency(hello DOGE). And those that don't have to figure out where to go and what to do. That is how I understand it.",
