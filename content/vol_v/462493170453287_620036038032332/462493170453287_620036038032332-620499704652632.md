   "message": "What I can put together in words right now: The internet opened up the world to me/everyone and cryptocurrency allows me/everyone to be in commerce without 3rd party interference, instantaneously. P2P contracting in an open source system designed by like minded people with secured social structure intended. A system designed to starve out the rats system of the Fiat fraud. Thereï¿½s so much more for me to learn about Dogecoin, Cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and computers. I have to reread this thread again because I know that there is lots of shared information that I need to absorb into my thinking. Thanks everyone.",
