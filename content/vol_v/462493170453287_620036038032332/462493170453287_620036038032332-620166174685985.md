   "message": "Its running for a short period of time and is already 5th most common coin..... The digging or mining is still at the beginning compared to bitcoin mining its relative less and easier to mine (but it wont be long) how I understand it and I may be off by miles, coins are limited, every transaction is being audited, there are so and so many coins in the block chain ....coins are released when a block chain is completed.......now as long its simple to mine coins are released steady but the more transactions are made the more computing power is needed to compute those...thus less coins are released decreasing the amount of coins for a transaction needed, which  based  on previous transactions or agreements required more coins......",
