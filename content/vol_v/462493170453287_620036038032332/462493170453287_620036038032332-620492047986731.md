   "message": "Being fairly fresh to crypto currencies, this chimp is still in learning faze mode. The only thing that stands out as to why dogecoin was chosen as the starting point is in the fact that it is very stable for an infant in the crypto currency spectrum coupled with it is Much Cheap to enter into the realm of understanding how crypto's do function.                                                                                To this chimp, i adore what the dogecoin community has accomplished for those in the world who need help. Neither sky daddy or govt. daddy has provided for them yet it has been the 'community' who has helped out.",
