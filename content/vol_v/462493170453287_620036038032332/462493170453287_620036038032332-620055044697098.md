   "message": "Dogecoin is currency without a tender for law or debt attached to it. It is money that can be used without creating joinder with Acts and Statutes. It's freedom money (not freedumb). It's also nobodies business if you have it and use it or profit by its use and it's encrypted so well that people can't tell if your person has it or uses it. Hope I'm getting this right Pete. I'm not sure why dogecoin though. :(",
