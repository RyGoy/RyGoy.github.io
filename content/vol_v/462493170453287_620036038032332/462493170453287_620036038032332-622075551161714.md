   "message": "I bought 20,000 Dogecoin for just under $50.00. I want to by it at it's current trading price like you guys did. So, I followed your advice and went to Dogecoin United. The only post I saw at Dogecoin United that explained how to buy Dogecoin was this link/post: http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-litecoin-dogecoin-vertcoin-how-buy-cryptocurrency-1435435 Following that link, the article said: \"The best-known is BitBargain, which is easy-to-use, fast and reliable, but there is also Bittylicious, bit121 and QuickBitcoin - all of which offer similar servcies.\" Which one of these sells Dogecoin at its current value? Thanks for the help! :)",
