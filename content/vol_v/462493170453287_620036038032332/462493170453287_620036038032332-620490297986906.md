   "message": "Why Doge?\n\nBitcoin has grown massively & is probably out of the reach of the group to acquire en masse.\n\nWhat is the next likely?  What is marketable, generous & fun, with an internet presence, readily mineable, acquirable & new that we, as a group can get in on the ground floor of, that still teaches the core principles and processes behind cryptocurrencies?\n\nDogecoin is the most logical, closely followed by Maxcoin, that fits these criteria.\n\nIf Dogecoin will reach 50% of its mining capacity soon, it will provide us with a good indication as to how this will play out in real time as dogecoin develops/matures.\n\nAnd Fucks the Puppy hasn't yet gained a foothold in the cryptocurrency market yet (and Stubucks haven't been launched yet)  ;-)",
