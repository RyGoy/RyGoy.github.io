   "message": "Should we buy as much Dogecoin as we possibly can? I'm sensing dogecoin might be our lifeboat. Is 10000 enough? I'm nervous I don't have enough.  Also Scott or Captain Pete , If I exchange 1 million Dogecoin for 1 million in legal tender, do i tell the government that I didn't make any money and that I only exchanged currencies? I'm confused about the exchange concept when it involves the legal tender. :(",
