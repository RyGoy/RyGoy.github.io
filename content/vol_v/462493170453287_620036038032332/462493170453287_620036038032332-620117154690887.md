   "message": "Dogecoin's volume is HUGE, it's in third place, after Bitcoin and Litecoin\n\nDogecoin is NOT suppose to have this kind of volume, and it's like that for weeks........It's suppose to be a JOKE :D\n\nDogecoin will reach 50% of its mining capacity very soon.....\n\nThere is 100 billions dogecoin available.......that can make a very efficient currency to use, for a lot of men and women\n\nDogecoin is at rank 6th, in market cap., IT'S NOT SUPPOSE to be like that :D\n\nSo if ever Dogecoin starts being what its suppose to be, no damage will be done to no one.......as far as getting 10,000 dogecoin for $15\n\nBut if Dogecoin continue to go where it's NOT suppose to go, to the moon, well, I suppose to expect the unexpectable :D\n\nSo, to answer Lana's question, is 10,000 is enough ??\n\nI have no freaking ideas :D , I can garranty you though, that I HAVE more than that :P",
