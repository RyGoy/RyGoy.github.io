   "message": "dogecoin wants graphics cards (gpu), maxcoin wants processor (cpu). so whatever you build now, you should plan for it to be multi platform useable because the field will change and you should be capable of adapting. \n\nbreadboarding such as what pierre has setup, aswell as planning for summer heat where you might need liquid cooling or even refrigeration is a consideration. delta T, the rate of change between running when it's only 20* F outside and your heating the box (house), v. summer when it's 90*F and your running the a/c to keep cool (comfortable) when you have that bonfire like pierre is going to run into burning coins in the basement is somthing that needs to be taken into consideration.",
