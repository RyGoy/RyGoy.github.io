   "message": "I am wondering about the contracts that can be made using the blockchain, for example one thing I listened to mentioned the possibility of assigning a piece of gold to a hash... What sort of mechanism is in place to ensure that one IN FACT has that gold or whatever to make the contract in the first place, and how is it being proposed to deal with \"broken contracts\" given the anonymity of the whole system? What have I missed?",
