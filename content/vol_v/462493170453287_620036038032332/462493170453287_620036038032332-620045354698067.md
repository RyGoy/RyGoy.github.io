   "message": "Dogecoin and the dogecoin community is unlike any other altcoin, in that it has a very helpful and generous community around it. This idea of people helping each other has spread the knowledge about the BLOCKCHAIN to more people. Since the answer to removing the parasitical banks and it's associated shitstains from humanity lies with the blockchain, I think DOGECOIN may be looked at as one the major events that brings about this massive change.",
