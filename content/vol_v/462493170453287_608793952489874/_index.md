   "message": "We learn from our Mistakes.\nWhat exactly was the presumption that we presumed earlier?\nDo you recall it? \nWhat would be considered a Leader?\nWe do not want this thing and We do not want to get in the way. \nWe have followed guidance and arrived at the ability to be a autonomous. \nI have questions but they all start fromï¿½\nWhat are we missing?\nWe have determined a value, we have determined it privately by an appraisal of assets and an inventory of skill's:\nThat is the equation of the value of lien: \nOn the titles generated at birth and the private business there of. \nWhich is quite a large Sum when the subject of this lien becomes known: It is private for now.\nWe have concluded an administrative process and are literally ready to enforce the lien. However, The Admiral Has said selling it to a bank might be a good thing or using it to generate credit by putting it up as collateral to a bank, which we have created as per proper notice and process, to care for this slave, this creation of others. \nWe would sincerely like to do the right thing. \nSince it is the highest form of Law.\nOurs is a provincial jurisdiction, being a duly authorized trustee corporation does not trust law transcend that?  \nWe created credit as a result of proper notice and process which is directly attributed to the Admiral. \nWe also have established an internal currency of Bobcoin. To engage in private matters.\nWe wish to exchange these credits on behalf of our private client by opening an account with Aquilae Trust or something like that. \nWe do not want to miss the point.\nWould this be a course that would benefit anyone here?\nSincerely and Kindest regards.\nThe Directors of Bob Uncle Ltd.",
