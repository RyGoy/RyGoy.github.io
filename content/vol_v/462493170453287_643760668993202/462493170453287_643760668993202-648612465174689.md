   "message": "I would expect the thieves to put out this kind of propaganda to influence the masses from even looking into Bitcoin. I am looking to get started in the Bitcoin arena. Does anyone have any recommendations for good material to read and research for building a strong education in this arena?  Moreover, why would I want to report what I mine or earn to the IRS.  They did not have anything to do with Bitcoins creation the pious-puking thieves.  So then, where the hell did they ever get the idea that they could take something that they had nothing to do with its creation?  Dang!  Do I want to hang these guys by their balls.",
