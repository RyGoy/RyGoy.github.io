   "message": "Captains give me my POWER, and they can take it back. The role of being in power does not forgive error. Currently those IN power rely on public ignorance.\n\nYou were once a captain, and now you are cargo. The admiral on a distant flagship doesn't care how upset CARGO is.\n\nGive POWER to those you TRUST. Don't try to get it yourself. That's how those \"in power\" put you in cages. They are NEVER directly involved in the use of force...and when force is used, that's where the POWER is. Notice the man/woman IN POWER has nothing to do with the people using force?\n\nAs someone with POWER, and bound by that trust to NEVER lie to you, I tell you this, and you should PAY ATTENTION:\n\nDO NOT SEEK POWER! BESTOW IT!",
