   "message": "Onlashuk Shugaharra,  you can start by installing a Dogecoin wallet at your end. Then, load your wallet with 10,000 Doge. Get coins FREE  (using faucets and/or \"digging\" for the coins with your machine), and/or exchanging them for another currency. Doge are very cheap to get, compared to bitcoin.  You may get a bitcoin wallet, as well, but we are \"practicing\" with Doge.\n\nMost of us here already have done this. There is a thread about his, started by Captain Pete Daoust.\n\nI also recommend you to go to the \"files\" section of this page, and read EVERYTHING that has the words \"Scott\" , \"Tender for Law\" and/or \"nuggets\" in the title. You may also visit Admiral Scott's page, and look for the NOTES section. You will find some important reading there, as well.\n\nI strongly recommend everyone new to READ as much as you can, before start yapping away here (I'm not implying you are). There is no tolerance for ignorance being passed as knowledge. But certainly ask all question you may have concerning what you are studying here. The Admiral himself, and/or some of us will be glad to point you out to the right place. Welcome.",
