   "message": "As an example Gail- the City of Toronto threatened to take my dad to court 4 times, 2 years ago. Never did, but this Inspection-Fee has been going up-and-up. At this point- we are now TELLING them- \"Take us to court ALREADY like you kept THREATENING too 4 years ago!\" Not a peep. All the Notices, Affidavits, Estoppels, all ignored...and we havent cut the grass at all last two summers, it looked like a field, they still leave us alone.",
