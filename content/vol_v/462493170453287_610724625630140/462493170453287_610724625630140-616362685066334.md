   "message": "oh, that was some thing happen to me too,  Gail Marie,  the bank accept my  instrument ............ I  was paying off a mortgage like everyone else does as usual...somewhere along the way I learned how to do an EFT/Electronic Funds Transfer.\n\nEFT = Electronic Funds Transfer.. supposedly a cheque that has 'cheque' crossed-out, and deposited, into a closed-chequing-account.. on the public or private side i forget (as it was told to me)\n\nThe bank accepted the instrument, and not only discharged my mortgage apparently, but, ALSO sent me a $4008 cheque for overpayment. Everything seemed ok, then, later the Bank basically says that they've just changed their minds and that OH BY THE WAY, \" you still owe us the remaining on your mortgage. \" However, The whole time keep in mind, the Bank have NEVER returned my EFT/Instrument/Negotiable Instrument. They get an order for a Writ of Possession against me, and let me know I has a certain time before I gets evicted...which happened last week in my condo being stormed by 9 cops and the City Sheriff. ....... Thanks to Derek Moran for helping  me to express  this situation, ~ but now I am taking the bank to court, for FRAUD",
