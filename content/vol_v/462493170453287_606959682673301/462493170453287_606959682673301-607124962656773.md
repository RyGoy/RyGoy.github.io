   "message": "\"Name five impressive things about yourself. Write them down or just shout them out loud to the room. But here's the catch -- you're not allowed to list anything you are (i.e., I'm a nice guy, I'm honest), but instead can only list things that you do (i.e., I just won a national chess tournament, I make the best chili in Massachusetts).\"\nUm... OK.\n\n1: I Write. A LOT, and EVERYONE (even the people who hate me) LEARNS.\n\n2: There is NOTHING I can't do with a computer.\n\n3: I tell the truth, when others won't, no matter the cost.\n\n4: I lie to deceivers and I do it well\n\n5: I'm the admiral of a private navy, filled with really smart officers who live and die at my command.\n\n6: I am in the middle of collapsing the banking system and starting a war.\n\n7: I profoundly understand women to a level where I reap all the benefits and endure none of the drawbacks of the gender.\n\n8: Everything I do, I do BETTER than everyone else; This list is an example.\n\n9: I am a GREAT composer.\n\n10: I dedicate 4 hours a day to study, so I will ALWAYS know more than you.\n\n:P\n\nPffft... GIVE ME A CHALLENGE, CRACKED!",
