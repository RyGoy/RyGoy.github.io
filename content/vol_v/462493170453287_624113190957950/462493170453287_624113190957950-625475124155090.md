   "message": "Pete. I think the question you are asking was part of a conversation Scott and I had. If I remember correctly, he was saying that putting a lien on THE NAME was \"WILFUL DAMAGE to a SECURITY INSTRUMENT\". The Marriage came first. IT has the claim, not you. Liening your name just makes you \"next in line\".",
