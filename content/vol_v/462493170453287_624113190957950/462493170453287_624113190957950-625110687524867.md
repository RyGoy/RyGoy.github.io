   "message": "The government is definitely trustee and surety for the certificate. They are the only signatory on the certificate. I am not sure that they are beneficiary tho. If they are, it would be a mistake that needs fixing. Perhaps that is what happened when the contract was signed. We \"neglected\" to name the beneficiaries and they acted AS trustee naming themselves as beneficiary. Is that what you are suggesting?",
