   "message": "Yes, the corporation is the only person that can have standing, in this matter.  Do not forget you can amend the lien anytime.\nI made some mistakes and corrected them as I went, As understanding was achieved.  It was not until recently that I completed all of this. The info I received was from the finical institutions depositors act. Which I cannot find my copy�\nGail Marie may have one kicking about.\nThe government has no standing to dispute any value  attached. Everything learned here was applied, as the goal was for me is to offset all debt, created by the security instrument attached to the vessel, as the original security agreement which = the value of the one share we are issued as citizens and given the bond to hold as cargo.\nThe lien is the receivers certificate of the bankruptcy of the legal person or the ALL CAPS NAME, that is being used without authorization once lien is in place.\nSo the corporation becomes the receiver of this value.\nIt is the equitable value of the one share�\nThat was the value of the LIen our trustee filed.\nYou can do a lien search on the person that was assigned to me thru this legal thing, if you had the required info and see on paper what the corporation, in which one share is owned by the sole shareholder, is now worth.\nIt is a substantial sum.\nI am in the process of creating the credit to account for this sum.

I had to learn all of it to do this.",
