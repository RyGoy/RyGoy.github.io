   "message": "*�.That's \"WILFUL DAMAGE to a SECURITY INSTRUMENT\". The Marriage came first. IT has the claim, not you. Liening your name just makes you \"next in line\".*\n\nMeans that a duly authorized trustee must do it.\nIt means, if you as the legal person = slave in pocket, do it, you are creating a conflict of interest.  The legal person came first, the duly authorized trustee, Liens that via the ALL CAPITAL Letters, spelling of the name.\nThe lien is the tool that puts you in front of the Governments claim on the marriage, The lien is the superior claim as title holders of the certificate created at the birth of the marriage.  It isolates that marriage certificate in commerce, making it unlawful for the government to trespass.  The Lien simply fixes this problem.  Keeping ALL PROPERTY CREATED AND OR DERIVED FROM THE TITLES SAFELY HELD IN TRUST, AND ADMINISTERED BY SOME ONE ELSE, BECAUSE IT IS NOT MINE.\nIT IS SIMPLY A CATCH 22 FOR THE GOVERNMENT WHEN ALL DONE IN PRIVATE, BY SOME ONE WE HAVE TRUSTED.\nONCE ALL THIS IS DONE, PROPER PUBLIC NOTICE PUTS YOU IN THE FRONT OF THE LINE,\n SO, A PPSA DOES AAAAALLLLLLL OF THIS.   SIMPLE.\nIT TAKES THE CERTIFICATES VALUE AWAY, THEY STILL HOLD IT AS A TRUSTEE� COPY HOLDER ( LOOK IT UP).",
