   "message": "So if we were the beneficiaries of the PERSONS, prior to MARRIAGE, and through MARRIAGE (\"the lawful union of two PERSONS\") the PERSONS were unionized, would we still not be  beneficiaries, but now unionized.  Only now , from an accounting perspective, one secures the other.    They, the trustees, are still the party with surety.  They benefit only if there is conflict between the parties, then the trustees have a duty to act in the best interest in the two parties DIVORCING (a separation of PERSONS), making sure the split of the PERSONS is to the benefit of both parties.  Lots of Administration.  If \"Her Majesty\" were the Beneficiary, then why are you running around being the Sole Authorized Administrator for the PERSON, as you are administrating ideally for the beneficiary. I believe we are the Settlors of the Private Trust, as we give all value, still, to the unionized PERSONS.",
