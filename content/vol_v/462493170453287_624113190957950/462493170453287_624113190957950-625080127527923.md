   "message": "back to this marriage issue if i may:  It is a private trust, perhaps very much like the private trust which is mainly discussed here where the person is liened by a corp. or \"buddy\" as Bobis Youruncle calls it.  The difference here is that \"Her Majesty\" is the trustee rather than a corp.(of ones own creation)  such as Quebec XXXXXXXXX.  That is why \"Her Majesty\" has liened the persons in who comprise the Private Trust (marriage). (same shit different trustee)  Now, let me put on my \"fucktard\" hat:  to \"amend\" the \"marriage\" is the remedy.  Removing the current trustee (Her Majesty) from their duty and creating a new ( Delaware corp.) to be entrusted with the duty of being trustee for the Private trust, for the \"marriage\" to be held in, would amend the marriage and thus nullify the current trustees lien claim on the persons, one would then lien the \"marriage certificate\" with the new corp. (perhaps from Delaware) get in line for the lien on the Persons as well, and one, whos person is \"married\", could be somewhat back out of COMMERCIAL vulnerability.  One would think that removing an \"un-trustable\"  trustee would be possible?  or am i being a  retard again?",
