   "message": "So if one could figure out how to administrate a MARITIME lien, such as being in a MARITIME jurisdiction (Delaware) then he who hold that lien hold the trump card.  Whereas in CANADA or 1 of the PROVINCES one could only administrate a (blank) lien.  Is someone willing to fill in the blank for me?",
