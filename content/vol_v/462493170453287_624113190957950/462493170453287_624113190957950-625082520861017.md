   "message": "Well, I return to the model we are familiar with, substitute Her Majesty with Quebecxxxx, you/and or your parents were the Grantor of the Person, as you are the grantor of the \"marriage\"  you are the beneficiary of the Person, as are you beneficiary of the marriage, the only difference is the Trustee is a party that is not trust-worthy.  I believe cara and I were the Grantors, as  well as the beneficiaries.  I think it is good to be the beneficiaries of the marriage  and with  the settlor/grantor, if united,  have the power to remove the trustee by virtue of it being in the best interest of the beneficiaries.?  Just switch Trustees and the model works in our favor again.",
