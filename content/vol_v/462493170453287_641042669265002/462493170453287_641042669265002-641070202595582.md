My understanding of assumpsit at the time was one who assumes liability for another's debt. I didn't sign it... That's relating to the incident in which I received confirmation of their receipt of the notice and I then completed that bill and returned it, for which I still haven't had a reply (obviously that's a good thing)... Just the notice in future so. Live & learn...",
