   "message": "Oliver Wendell Holmes was an over-rated blow-hard who has nothing of use to say.\n\nHe was a piece of shit, made out to be of \"value\". You all have heard of his famous \"you can't yell fire in a crowded theater\" statement, when discussing the limits of free speech. What nobody mentions, is that he was putting the publishers of a Yiddish newspaper in jail, for daring to write, in a language that most Americans COULDN'T READ, that America should not be involved in the Great War (WW1).\n\nThe sack of shit JAILED them. Quote Hitler. I'd have more respect for you :P",
