   "message": "I may be thinking wrong, but It seems that if money is owed by PHILLIP  to FAMILY SUPPORT and they have suspended his license for one year to \"pay\" his debt, he may bill them for 24hr x 365 days x hourly rate. The total amount would be more than PHILLIP owes. And since they are not going to send that total to PHILLIP the first time, give them a bullshit buffet of send a check and remove the suspension OR if I don't receive a check, It will be understood that there is no longer any debt due to the offset  and the account is closed  and that the suspension is lifted.",
