   "message": "Marriages are PRIVATE TRUSTS with a GOVERNMENT LIEN on the parties.\n \nThat is why PRENUPTUAL AGREEMENTS are so EASY to kill. POST NUPTIAL agreements are ROCK solid. I have NEVER seen a challenged POST NUPTIAL AGREEMENT succeed. Not even once.\n \nIf you make an amendment to the marriage, the GOVERNMENT has no say. It's TRUST business now.\n\n~Scott Duncan",
