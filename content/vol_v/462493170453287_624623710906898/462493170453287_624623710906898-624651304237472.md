   "message": "Well if you are CURRENTLY married, you are CURRENTLY fucked. It's a bill of lading that secures your PERSONS in the same way Rogueupport has secured Tara and My \"PERSONS\".\nYou need the government's PERMISSION to disolve the \"bill of lading\". We only require the SHAREHOLDER'S permission...and they're WAY nicer than the government. \nIf both parties lien their names, then wouldn't that take the surety out of the equation?\nThat's \"WILFUL DAMAGE to a SECURITY INSTRUMENT\". The Marriage came first. IT has the claim, not you. Liening your name just makes you \"next in line\".",
