   "message": "Now think about this marriage transaction. The marriage INCLUDES \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", not \"Scott\" OR \"Tara\". This means marriage makes you effectively ONE PERSON UNDER THE LAW. Since the marriage actually consists of THREE ENTITIES, \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", which by its nature EXCLUDES the GOVERNMENT, still remains an \"ORGANIZATION\". A marriage ORGANIZES these \"entities\" into their respective roles. If \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\" remain \"Scott AND Tara\", the GOVERNMENT HAS NO STANDING. However, if Tara sought a divorce, the MARRIED PERSON is no longer \"Scott AND Tara\", and the GOVERNMENT gets to intervene.",
