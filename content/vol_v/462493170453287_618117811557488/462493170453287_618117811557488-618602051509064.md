   "message": "Why do the Conspiratard Government idiots think their lies mean ANYTHING to the Ethereum project?\n\nDo they REALLY think bad-mouthing it is going to somehow STOP it?\n\nDid it stop Crypto-Currencies? No? Then what idiotic thought process leads them to believe it will work against something that's effectively EXACTLY THE SAME?\n\nDo they think FUNDING is an issue? FUNDING means they can hire REAL TALENT, but the \"Heavy Lifting\" is done.\n\nI WISH I could hire developer staff, but I don't NEED to, and I run a global network!\n\n...actually Daniel J Wentz does, but the point is clear. The CLOSEST they will ever get is that the Ethereum won't get the funding for full-time developers to bug-swat, and they will have to do it themselves... So it stays in BETA for an extra year; Big Fucking Deal",
