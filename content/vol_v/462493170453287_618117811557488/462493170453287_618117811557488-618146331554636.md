   "message": "I have just finished reading through the entire thread there at bitcoin.org on the MAXCOIN. There seems to be a lot of haters posting. They are saying things about the developers are in it to pump and dump it. Also that normal people with basic computers are not going to be able to mine very many coins etc. Is there a chance Admiral Scott Duncan would take the time to peruse that thread and offer any commentary? It seems Max Keiser's intentions are good. People like Pete Daoust may not stand to gain much, given that this new coin wouldn't be too friendly to his monster setup.",
