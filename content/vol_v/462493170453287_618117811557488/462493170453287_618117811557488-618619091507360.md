   "message": "OK. I need some pointers here please. \n\nI am looking liberate my notebook of it's blockchain related activities / mining. \n\nI would like to keep the Dogecoin mining going and prepare to possibly mine the maxcoin if I can get this together in time.\n\nI had a look at the wiki for CPU mining specs with the MaxCoin in mind.\n\nI am considering a motherboard with FM2+, A10 6800K and at least one slot for a decent GPU...\n\nI have a very limited amount available. The above spec would allow me to keep the DOGE coming in at about 4X what the laptop is currently doing and the CPU seems to be one of the best for CPU mining with the MaxCoin in mind there.\n\nAny words of wisdom on this?",
