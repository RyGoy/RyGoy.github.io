   "message": "Agreed Beverly Berta Braakschmack. \n\nMike Maloney did not reveal anything the \"required viewing\" doesn't show us but perhaps more simply with better visuals and in less time. \n\nOf course, it is a commercial for his corporation, \"Hidden Secrets Of Money is brought to you by GoldSilver.com... Founded by Mike Maloney in 2005...\" (copied from site), so ya, he is trying to \"cash in\" on the proliferation of this information.\n\nI think \"he\" will do quite well because \"most\" people have an attachment to precious metals and it is ingrained in their thinking \"it will always be of value\".\n\nI can see many people not realizing how worthless it can be during various conditions... IE: After the fall of the USSR, fundamental requirements like food, especially after becoming scarce, the prices inflated many times. Currency was practically worthless, precious metals devalued and they were back to trading tangibles.\n\nNevertheless, precious metals regained in price after market stabilization. I doubt anyone got their moneys worth though. :)",
