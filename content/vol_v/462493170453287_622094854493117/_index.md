   "message": "I must express my jubilation regarding my being accepted, at this time, into The Tender For Law Facebook page. I have much to learn and will appreciate what I learn by spreading the information gained. On an extremely distant side note,at the risk of my being kicked out almost as soon as being allowed entry, has anyone ever seen the film Mr.Freedom? I do recommend it for a chuckle. \nI will take in as much as you all have provided after which I will start to participate in the conversation.",
