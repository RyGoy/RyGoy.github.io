   "message": "HA HA, I love getting calls like this too! You really can hone your skills with these kind of people. Ask if this is a follow up call from 3 months ago, and then tell them that they were to get back to you in a couple of days and you are really upset that it took so long to return the call. HAVE FUN WITH THEM.",
