   "message": "Admiral Scott. What would a VALID bill of sale require? \n\nI am about to acquire some land property, and I know a bill of sale is something I want to get my hands on. So I drafted one already, as a courtesy, to the seller. \n\nI have been doing research. A bill of sale is something very simple. Is basically an instrument that transfers title to personal property from a seller, to a buyer. \n\nIt most contain the names of the seller, and buyer, with a date, description of the property, and a value received.\n\nMy question again is, what would make a bill of sale VALID, if anything, besides what I know? 3 witnesses? A notary?",
