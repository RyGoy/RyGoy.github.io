   "message": "Would it be to one's benefit to privately CONTRACT into a sale of agreement to purchase a parcel of land?  \n\nIf one purchased this land with fiat currency by the person one has in her pocket, that land will be Government's INVENTORY.  \n\nI am aware there are ways to make this piece of land UNTOUCHABLE, and have full control over it.  I know this is through someone I TRUST, but that is all.\n\nIf I have a contract to buy a thing but only get it part paid for and then run out of money, do I have a security interest in the thing that I could lien?",
