Less like a \"kick-out\" or \"divorce\", more like a psycho bitch \"dentist\" wannabe who can't make up her mind and who happens to have a unconvincing lawyer? If you guys could get on with that we'd be happy to stop subsidizing french CBC. Take New Brunswick with you while your at it. We will have  a \"Bluenose\" state, well,.. except for Cape Breton. Im pretty sure the Capers want nothing to do with the mainland!",
