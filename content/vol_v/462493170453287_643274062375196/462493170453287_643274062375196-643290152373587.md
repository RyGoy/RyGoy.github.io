   "message": "Bullshit. \nGucci and those shit brands are worse than TV or whatever drug.\n\nCoffee to make you a fast working slave by day. \nAlcohol to make you forget your daily slavery at night.\n\nMy opinion : Alcohol just unleaches the real you. Breaks the chains of who you really are. Majority is wrong on alcohol because they're wrong from the core, distracted and deresponsibilized from the core.\n\nI'm not saying I'm right. Just that I know what it does to me and - you know all those drafts I show you before sending them out, most of them, I drafted sipping some rum or beer, and cleaned them up the next morning.\n\nHas there ever been a coffee prohibition ? Why is that ? But weed and alcohol... Is it possible that these things change your frequency/channel/something ? 432hz ? I dunno. \nDont take my word for it, look it up for yourself.\nPlus : Pirates were drinking rum :D Scott ?",
