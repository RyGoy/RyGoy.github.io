   "message": "let's say I have a BILL and it has been dishonored. I've sent proper notice, opportunity to cure and final notice of default. I then affirm an affidavit of obligation take my mail receipts and notices and create and register a notice of security interest. Lets say the security is $50.000.000.00, Where would I register this. Service Ontario says liens can only be registered for personal property that has been used as collateral to obtain a loan or that is being repaired or stored. If I want to lien The Chiefs of Police or say the Privy Council of Canada,  and Justice Department, is that possible or do we go after the individual who endorsed false claims?",
