   "message": "is that warrant # the one you appeared for last monday? it is dated 2013 and apparently on a 'form' letter because it says your lic. could be suspended. yes it is a double jeopardy threat using the old warrant over again which should have expired 30 days after it was issued or sooner because they brought you in on it, but it is still good for 30 days.\nknowing you can't post a bail without signing an agreement, you should plan that they will attempt to hold you, so get your ducks in order.\nthey probably shredded the documents you wrote on once they figured out what you did.",
