   "message": "Ok....I am out of there and here is what I did.  I am not sure if it is entirely right, so please critique if your name is Scott.  If your name is not Scott, fuck off!!  :-P\n\nThey called the NAME at role call.  I stood up and said I am here on behalf of the Defendant.  I asked for an original charging or accusatory instrument.  The \"Judge\" said he will come back to that as it was the Prosecutors case.  The Prosecutor said the cop was there to testify.  \n\nI again asked for an original charging or accusatory instrument.  He said I was given copies.  I said I required to inspect and execute an original.  A back and forth ensued a couple times.  I finally got 2 document.  One I had seen and had copies of (It was the Criminal Complaint), and the other I wasn't sure what it was. The second had something stapled onto the back so if I flipped it, it would have writing on both sides.  \n\n Regardless, I flipped them both over and wrote ACCEPTED BY: <signature> and underneath that put the SSN account number of the Person.  They flipped out and demanded I stop.  I told them I am almost finished.  When I finished, I handed them to the Bailiff.\n\nThe Bailiff gave them to the Judge as I announced I have deposited the Surety Bond an Affidavit and a Notice into the Court.  The Judge said the Kourt doesn't accept these.  I said again FOR THE RECORD, I have accepted the charges on behalf of the Surety and deposited the Surety Bond into the Kourt.  The Judge recessed and I went home.  \n\nNow, I am not sure what they will do from here, but as far as I can see, this matter is settled.",
