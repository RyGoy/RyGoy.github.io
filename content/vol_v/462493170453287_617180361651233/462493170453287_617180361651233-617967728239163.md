   "message": "i'm planning to try out tails. if it runs a swap file in the data storage, i think i would set up a pair of them and split the encryption key between them. then set up the second one to be coded to look at the clock cycle from the first, and if you dont insert it timed just right it locks or self destructs the code. meanwhile i will do a back up of the code on plastic tags divided amongst a few dozen tree's over by the stream. what looks like a nature walk for mushrooms would be a good disguise for recovering a key, and the cops/government couldnt ever figure out... nobody could figure out there are 51 clay pots of plants coded for some specific alignment order and each one somehow contains one each of the string for the encryption code. even if them pots become a hundred years old cracked from weather out in an old tool shed that nobodys used for 3 generations one could still cement enough of the shards together to align the pattern and recover the code.\n\nlike secret messages inside eggs. nobody would ever think about looking for hidden coded messages written on the inside of egg shells.",
