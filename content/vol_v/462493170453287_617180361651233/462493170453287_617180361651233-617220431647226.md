   "message": "Let me summarize:\n\nSince 1982, Canada has been under a Commercial Trust, and the trustees are breaking the rules, systemically. If you don't accept this, kill yourselves; You're too stupid to live and are consuming precious resources  (Your sacrifice WILL be forgotten, because, as I said, you're too stupid to live).\n\nThis means that the TENDER FOR LAW THAT MONEY PROVIDES IS IN FACT A FRAUD. (You aren't getting what you paid for, and the response is \"What are you gonna do about it\"?) \n\nWhen you call them on it, they get violent. Nobody will call them to account, because nobody can even grasp the basics anymore.\n\nI know this, because I was cast out from the people who built the whole thing. I also know what to do about it; Collapse the banking system and start a war.\n\nI'm doing it with computers and trained monkeys (That's you).\n\n...now you're all caught up.",
