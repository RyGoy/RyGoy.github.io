We read the posts, however, because of the time differentiation between us there are so many comments posted, we miss many of them.\nYou may recall that, in the past, we have contributed many comments.\nNevertheless, we have often asked questions about one thing or the other, but they are most often ignored. Consequently, we now just read, time permitting, and say nothing.\nIf you want us to just fuck off, then just say so.",
