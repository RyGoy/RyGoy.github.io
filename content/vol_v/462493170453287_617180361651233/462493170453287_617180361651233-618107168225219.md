   "message": "\"Please Note: Doge Vault cannot receive payments mined using P2P pools, and any transactions sent to your dogecoin address here will not be credited to your balance and will be considered a site donation. MPOS pools are fine.\"\n\nP2P pools are distributed groups of miners. It has nothing to do with you, the end user. You only need a wallet. Leave the mining to the propeller-heads, and enthusiasts like Pete Daoust. \n\nMining is a project unto itself.",
