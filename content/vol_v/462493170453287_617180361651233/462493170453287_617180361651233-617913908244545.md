   "message": "The way I see it is that this group was created by someone who, fpr his knowledge, never asked for anything in return.\nHe doesn't need this group, we do!\n\nSo there is a task (for our benefit...so they say) that was thrown in.\n\nThe choice is still ours!!! We can take it or leave it. \n\nBut if we trust the words of this Admiral and of the Captain, then I think we can trust them as well when they say that this is for our good.\n\nAnd I beleive that this is done to get things moving. Like Scott said, all questions were answered.\n\nSo let's get on with it...\n\nJust saying! :)",
