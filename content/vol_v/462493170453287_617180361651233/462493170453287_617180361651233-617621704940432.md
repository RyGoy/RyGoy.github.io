   "message": "Icbeonne Senama: The choice was simple. The Ubuntu architecture, packaging and design are the best in the industry. \n\n...UNITY on the other hand, is a buggy, bloated, not-ready-for-prime-time, cobbled together piece of crap.\n\nLxde (and openbox) are a good stable environment, and we can port any interface work, to embedded builds like SliTaz, with very little (or no) changes.\n\nXFCE is simple and lightweight... too much so.  To the point of being dumb. I don't like it at all. Don't get me wrong, LXDE/OPENBOX have their own annoyances, but we've worked around them.\n\nThat's about it.",
