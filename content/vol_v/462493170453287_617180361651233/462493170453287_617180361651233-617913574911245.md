   "message": "as i peruse the list taking note that an exchange of fifteen dollars for 10k in dogecoins. I do not have fifteen dollars to afford to loose when i can trade it for 30# of white granular sugar, or 1.5# of freeze dried coffee (folgers), or 5 Gallons of whole (3%) red cap milk. (which i only consume a quart of before it goes bad, so i need that in small quantities at a time).\n\nso until the grocer or fuel station is willing to accept them, or any number of online distributors from whom i could exchange them with for needed goods, they are technically worthless.\n\nif you feel you must delete me from TT4L for that reason then so be it. know that if you did, your act would be fraud and discredit you for having become a dictator.",
