   "message": "The ACT was served when stopped, to constable or whatever he was, came up to window, they were later unable to locate them, Lots of junk going on.  Forcibly removed from vehicle, kidnapped and detained on things that happened prior to tt4l, So now time to clean it up. I did not know it well enough from memory. They did not care any way, he would not believe me that the criminal code of canada was for govt employees and since I was vice president how could I be an employee.  I was also under duress and coercion. At one point, I was in some sort of restraint hold, one guy on each arm, and one guy behind me, they then bent both thumbs and fingers back, while applying pressure to the elbow, the way it is not supposed to go [after I plugged security cameras view with paper of the toilet], to make me move, it worked�\nI need to work on my holding up under cross examination skills. I signed finger print thing as company, everything else has a vp after it. \nI am out on peace bond.   They would not let me see a JP till finger printed.  I will take notice of mistake and walk away� They did not recognize the corporate licence.\nThis is 100% my fuck up, in that I did not apply what was learned properly. My terms were not recognized.\nAs per the Admiral and the surety thread:  chronic Dunning�Kruger effect, go to jail :-P\n I used the \n\" If I have given you any reason to believe I am an agent or employee of the government that would be a mistake please forgive me\" I did \"point of order\" \"Reservation of all rights\" The previously mentioned \" Notice of mistake statement\" To which the Justice responded \"Well thats all fine but there is this restitution thing�\nThis is where I dropped the ball.  I was unable at that moment to say \" Why are you speaking?, It did not come to me instantaneously�\nI had just walked down the hallway where the 3 guys who had restrained me and rubbed my face into the urine soaked concrete of a isolation cell, approx 15 hours previous,  were stationed along the hallway walking into JP.  It was a loss. It was brutal. \n I have some shit to admin now.  \nI will take the Notice of Mistake, It was listened to,\nI learned that at least. \nMy ineptness, doesn't take the effectiveness of that away.",
