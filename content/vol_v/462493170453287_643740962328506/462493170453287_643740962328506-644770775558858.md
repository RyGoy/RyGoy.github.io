   "message": "The gold bar was the Promissory Note...\n\nHere's something I wrote them (best english translation I can come up with right now) :\n\nIf you claim you have the right to, without my consent, deprive me and/or dispose of this security for which I am the sole creditor, and consequently, for which I hold all equity, and/or if you claim you have to right to unilaterally decide to keep and/or not return the original promissory note and/or that the Law prohibits you from returning it and/or states that you and/or someone else must destroy it without my consent and against my will, I request that you provide me within 10 days with the Law to which you are referring to as it would violate the definition of a promissory note and I, to the best of my knowledge, never consented to give you authority to do so.",
