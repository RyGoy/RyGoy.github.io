   "message": "I heard back from the bank today by regular mail.  ;)   Happy to hear from me and  about my enquiry. They wanted to make sure they were taking good care of a valued customer. They said \"it appears from our research that your mortgage has been discharged\". ( I sent a copy of their  discharge of mortgage along with my claim of principal)So they basically avoided a direct response to  the question raised.",
