   "message": "Haha! She is trained to LIE.\n\nThat contract is a PROMISSORY NOTE. Well, let's look at the definition, and see what we find: <<When the amount due on the note, including interest and penalties (if any) is paid, the note must be cancelled and surrendered to the person(s) who signed it. >>\n\nIf you go to a bank, and give them some gold to hold, while you \"re-pay\" them some money lent, at the end of you \"re-paying\" the loan: how can the bank come say \"sorry, we are not returning your gold, it has been destroyed. The \"law\" said we had to!\"? You see? The same thing applies here.\n\nOf course, creditors don't cry. If the note is not returned, send them an INVOICE.\n\nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/promissory+note",
