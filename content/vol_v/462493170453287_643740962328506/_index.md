   "message": "So I'm taking a shot at getting back, from a bank, the original promissory note I signed to create the principal of a loan for which I have honoured my part of the contract back in 2009...\n\nI just had the bank lady over the phone, she said there are always 2 originals, one was *she said* given to me (well if I ever got it, I obviously can't see - as a good programmed chimp - how I would have kept it until this day...) and the other they keep in a SAFE place.\n\nShe was actually surprised their original was still IN THE VAULT when she went to look it up (it was contracted in 2007 and paid in full on May 5th 2009) and said after 5 years (that's in a few weeks from now) they send their original \"TO A SPECIAL PLACE\" and \"The law says it must be destroyed\" and \"they cannot give it back to me\"...\n\nShe offered to leave a \"certified\" copy (guess that's worthless anyways - at least it proves they still got something there) for me at the front desk and I asked her to make sure they keep THEIR original past May 5th, just to make things easier if I ever wanted to claim it...\n\nHas anyone been there already ?",
