   "message": "I think you invoice them with the name of the person you happen to have in your pocket. Only PERSONS can be seen in that world of commerce. :P\n\nIf you are not acting under a private trust (where a PROXY/CORPORATION acts as TRUSTEE), like Scott's situation, then it's better to act as the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR, and/or SOLE BENEFICIARY, depending on the situations. That way, the BC of the PERSON, gives the PERSON limited liability, like they have when performing as TRUSTEES, or as SOLE BENEFICIARY to detach yourself from ANY/ALL PUBLIC DOCUMENTS. You get it?\n\nThat's what I think. That is what Pete is doing.\n\nScott Duncan or Pete Daoust, please correct me if I'm wrong.",
