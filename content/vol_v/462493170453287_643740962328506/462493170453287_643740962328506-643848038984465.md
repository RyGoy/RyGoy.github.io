   "message": "Well she really told me \"after 5 years\" and she \"was surprised they still had it in their VAULT\" ? She said she added a note on file to keep the original they had past May 5 as per my request... Hopefully I can have something worked out by then... I'll try to word something up to claim \"THEIR\" copy, since I no longer have the one they gave to the PERSON, and even if it's THEIR copy, I signed and I fulfilled that contract, so I guess it's pretty obvious I still am the one who gave the value to whatever copy of that contract may exist...\n\nSo I just picked up those papers...\nI read somewhere someone said their was only our signature on those promissory notes... Mine has the bank employee too ; as a witness I guess... Time to figure this one out...",
