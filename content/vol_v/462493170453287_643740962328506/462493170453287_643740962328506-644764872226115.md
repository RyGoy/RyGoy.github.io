And that's why I still haven't created a XXXXXXQCINC yet...\n\nWhy wouldn't the PERSON with the bank account claim the security instrument which it gave to the bank to create the principal and which the bank is supposed to give back to that very PERSON ? Why would it need another PERSON to do it ? Why couldn't that PERSON invoice the bank directly ? The PERSON in my pocket does have a business#, it's not INC but it's been producing valid invoices for 15 years now ?",
