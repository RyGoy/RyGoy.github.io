   "message": "\"I have a long list of failures, from light-weights like Derek Moran\"\n\nYou know Scott, i watched you explain to Monnomest Janick just how potentially super-rich wealthy she could/is going to become- and it occurred to me, \"MONEY\" is just a 'tool.' We only NEED it, when we're SPENDING it. And im someone really of simple tastes who might like to splurge on a few things here or there if i had the means, but in reality, i wouldnt know what to do with as much money as the guy who signs the paycheque of a high-paid athlete. So, it would only make sense, that after using what i needed and/or for a few wants, that i hand over any SURPLUS that i wouldn't have any need to use at the time, back to you for YOU to use, to put towards the INITIATIVES that you are focusing on- keeping in mind, that it would be held by you 'In Trust' for me.\n\nYou see- im not a gold-digger who doesnt wanna \"fuck the rich guy\"... i HAVE been reading, i HAVE been listening, i HAVE been paying attention, but its just like Lou said at the Dean Clifford seminar: \"Ahhhh (i get it)...you just like to research\"",
