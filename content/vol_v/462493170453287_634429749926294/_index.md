   "message": "Helloss Tara Duncan\n\nI think I need your help, so I ask for it \n\nI have been meeting with a Man recently, a nice Man, and I felt EQUAL to him, even though he has a lot more ACADEMIC knowledge than me, he is what the system promote, well EDUCATED Man, all this education acquired from this system, he smells good, looked good�.blablabla�.\n\nIn other words, he is filled with �feels good� stuff, and has lots of CERTIFICATE/DIPLOMA to prove it.\n\nAnyway, he was in a very dark place, when I met him, he was organizing his death, because no other options seems to be available to him, he think he owe a few hundred thousand dollars to QRA, because QRA said so, and he tried everything he could, using his academic knowledge, to get out of that situation, and failed.\n\nSo, after listening and OBSERVING him, I felt this �MAN� was in deep shit, and I thought I might help him, in fact, my whole body was burning in flame, because I really think I can fix his shit in about 20 minutes, with my NON-academic knowledge.\n\nSo I proceeded in telling him who I am, in a very smooth manner, and what I do with public debts, and after 30 to 45 minutes, this �MAN� seems to have lost this idea of putting a bullet in his head, and, I have to admit, it made me �feel good�.\n\nAnd on my way back home, I seriously questioned myself about this�\n\nIs this shit is fucking �REAL� ?\n\nI will NOT suppose in my mind that I just saved a MAN�s life, and will not give myself �credit� about it, but fuck, the �feeling� was PRICELESS !! :/\n\nTara, please help me here, IS THIS REALITY or BELIEFS ?\n\nHow can I let a Man, shoot him self, for a freaking PUBLIC DEBT, if I \"have\" something, that MIGHT help ? :(\n\nBut do I \"have\" something REAL, or is that thing is a BELIEF ?\n\nI don�t want to go out there and play little Jebus, I don�t want to �save the planet�, I don�t want to create �beliefs� in Man�s mind�..\n\nBut that �feeling� I had, after that meeting, was weird and unprecedent, for �me�\n\nThanks Tara, and sorry for my accent :D\n\nWhy I ask Tara Duncan ?, because FUCK OFF, that's why :P\n\nPete.",
