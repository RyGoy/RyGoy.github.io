   "message": "Hi Pete: sorry I haven't posted a comment, I've been in bed with a bad flu.  But I don't want you to think I wouldn't answer a question from you.\n\nRegarding your post\n\n... we are conditioned to \"believe\" that helping others should make us feel good.  In this particular case you felt a euphoria from your percieved influence on this stranger for several reasons. First, your comments indicate you feel inferior to this man [more ACADEMIC knowledge than me, he is what the system promote, well EDUCATED Man, all this education acquired from this system, he smells good, looked good], so it is a rush when you have information he does not.  There is also the perception of accomplishment in having \"saved\" a person's life (love a good biblical reference).\n\nFurther to that, I'm not sure you're asking if your question of belief relates to your feelings following the conversation, or the information you presented to him.  Perhaps you can clarify.\n\nA few notes on your post:\n\nWell educated does not equal intelligent.\nSuicidal people are not generally concerned with their personal appearances, having given up all hope.\nSuicidal people, having made up their minds to end their lives, do not generally discuss their plans with others\nWhat idiot chooses death to escape the obligation to produce coloured bits of paper?\nDid you see a gun?\nDid he have a well-formulated plan?\nIf you believed he was serious did you think about notifying his relatives or anyone else that might help him?\nDo you have any way of ascertaining if he is alive next week?  Or the week after?\n\nIf you have no answers to these questions, your feelings are probably invalid.",
