   "message": "I was just wondering if \"me\" having the POWER of saving OTHER's life, with what I know, was REAL or BELIEFS\n\nI have administrated 15 debts so far, and NONE of them came back, so the reality of ADMINISTRATION is kind of clear :D\n\nBut the \"alleged power\" I seems to have in my hands, is mysteriously mysterious :D\n\nIt seems that I can wipe out a $20 debt, or a 20 million dollar debt :-o\n\nIt's a bit scary...... so I thought Tara would filled me in, on this stuff... :P",
