   "message": "The first day I have met Chad, was on Dean's website, he was giving details about how STRICT he was with his children, and how they had to OBEY his AUTHORITY........so we had an ONLINE fight, right at the start.\n\nI told him to do as Pink Floyd says, and leave them children alone, and a few other stuff, he even mentioned, that a little \"spank\" was not a bad thing, for children......I suggested him to never \"spank\" them if I am close, because I would \"spank\" him......\n\nThat's how I have met Chad :D",
