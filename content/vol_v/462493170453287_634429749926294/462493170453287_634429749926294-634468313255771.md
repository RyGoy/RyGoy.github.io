   "message": "All belief is evil.\nWhy should I believe what Pete says, or even Scott, or the government, without asking questions ? \nLet's say Pierre may be wrong, and Scott too (who knows !?) the only party which can provide answers is the party that created this entire mudpit and left me stuck in the middle of it, which I didnt consent to.\n\nI'm clearly more confused than I've ever been about all their bullshit, I clearly am a party in that bullshit, so I clearly have the right to ask questions and get answers.\n\nProblem is they stopped replying and never provided answers to the CLEAR and SIMPLE questions I asked so far. If it was all wrong, they'd have told me already, \"hey buddy I think you're confused go back to school\" it would have been very easy... So clearly they are refusing to disclose some info, and I told them that's the feeling I have... And they leave me no choice but to investigate by myself, and investigation means going out there and maybe getting dirty, but if noone else goes, someones gotta do it, and we have the right to ask questions, I have the right to the SURETY of the PERSON, and if the Bank of Canada cannot help me with what I'm asking them to do, they will most certainly let me know...",
