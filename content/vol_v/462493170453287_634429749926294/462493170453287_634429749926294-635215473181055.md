   "message": "Scott Duncan, I posted this yesterday : \nI'm starting to wonder, is it possible that anyone WITHOUT A PERSON actually IS NOBILITY ?\n\nI know it sounds rather simple to be logic, but as there's a high probability that I think wrong here again, maybe it's not as stupid as it actually seems to me ? So what is it that's actually required for nobility to exist - except for people to recognize it as such, obviously ?\n\nAnd if nobility have no legal PERSONS, it means they cannot have a PERSON'S driver's license or passport in their pocket ? Let's say Scott Duncan is a noble, how would he travel to a place where they don't know who he is (let's say Australia which is controlled by other nobles and where he'd be asked for a passport) and be allowed to relax on a beach there - like any good pirate who feels like chilling on the land every now and then - doing his things (having sex I guess) without constantly being bothered by agents who'd possibly be upset to hear they are not even qualified to bother him ?",
