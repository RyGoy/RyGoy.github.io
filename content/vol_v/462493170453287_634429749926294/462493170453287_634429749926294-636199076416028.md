   "message": "What idiot chooses death to escape the obligation to produce coloured bits of paper? A real desparate one :/\n\nDid you see a gun? NO\n\nDid he have a well-formulated plan? I did not asked :(\n\nIf you believed he was serious did you think about notifying his relatives or anyone else that might help him? YES\n\nDo you have any way of ascertaining if he is alive next week? Or the week after? I talk to him everyday, since that night, He is ADMINISTRATING all that shit, and seems to be less desparate :/\n\nIt was more about my feelings following the conversation, because DOUBT kicked in after, I was not even sure of what I know anymore, and I thought giving FALSE hope to others, was not a good thing to do......The way I administrate PUBLIC debts, is fairly new to me, and after having done several administrations, I have no ANSWERS.....they just become in full silence mode... :/\n\nI go over this, everyday, trying to find where I could be wrong, regarding administration of debts, and I can't find anything, I just can't......so it has to be TRUE ! :/\n\nThanks :)",
