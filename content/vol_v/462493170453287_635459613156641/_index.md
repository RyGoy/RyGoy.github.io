   "message": "Human nature doesn't change and History allways repeats itself. \n \nWe have deluded ourselves by living in a \"fools paradise!!\"\n             \n            Subject: : US Obituary - An Essential Read \n            A scary Obituary ... and it is occurring as you read this: \n\n            In 1887, Alexander Tyler, a Scottish history professor at the University of Edinburgh, had this to say about the fall of the Athenian Republic some 2,000 years prior:  \"A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government.  A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury.\n\n            >From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse over loose fiscal policy, (which is) always followed by a dictatorship.\"\n            \"The average age of the world's greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about 200 years.  During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence:\n            �         From bondage to spiritual faith;�         From spiritual faith to great courage;�         From courage to liberty;�         From liberty to abundance;�         From abundance to complacency;�         From complacency to apathy;�         From apathy to dependence;         �         From dependence back into bondage.\" \n            \nThe Obituary follows: Born 1776, Died 2012\n            It doesn't hurt to read this several times. \n\n            Professor Joseph Olson of Hamline University School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota, points out some interesting facts concerning the last Presidential election:\n            Number of States won by:  Obama: 19   Romney: 29\n            Square miles of land won by:  Obama: 580,000   Romney: 2,427,000 \n\n            Population of counties won by:  Obama: 127 million   Romney: 143 million \n\n            Murder rate per 100,000 residents in counties won by:  Obama: 13.2   Romney: 2.1 \n\n            Professor Olson adds: \"In aggregate, the map of the territory Romney won was mostly the land owned by the taxpaying citizens of the country.\n            Obama territory mostly encompassed those citizens living in low income tenements and living off various forms of government welfare...\"\n            Olson believes the United States is now somewhere between the \"complacency and apathy\" phase of Professor Tyler's definition of democracy, with some forty percent of the nation's population already having reached the \"governmental dependency\" phase. \n\n            If Congress grants amnesty and citizenship to twenty million criminal invaders called illegals - and they vote - then we can say goodbye to the USA in fewer than five years.\n            Foot Note: Whilst the numbers may be less the same applies to Australia but perhaps in 5-10 years.\n            If you are in favour of this, then by all means, delete this message.\n            If you are not, then pass this along to help everyone realize just how much is at stake, knowing that apathy is the greatest danger to our freedom.",
