   "message": "I always wondered why the believers, were so quick to throw their own under the bus�\nI get it now.\nUnder the guise of forgiveness, they can do anything with out worrying about it.\nI would see the lack of empathy and in my naivet�' it never made sense.  I was always perplexed at this psychopathic behaviour in all forms of belief.  \nI have grown up a bit, in here.\nCan't do coke any more�. \nI go to instant psychosis and then see snakes and shit� \nHard lesson learned. Driving these guys around for weeks on end, longest I was up continuously was 21 days�\nby the end of it I was talking to myself across the room, Fucked up beyond all recognition.\nMuch better now� The hookers were way cheaper�",
