   "message": "I don't know enough about it to comment with any certainty. For what it's worth in regards to the language in the line Pete highlighted why do you need  \"To make it perfectly clear\" and then add \"We are pretty sure\" (which lacks clarity in my mind).  Wouldn't \" To make it perfectly clear you have been notified of the mistake that has been made on two previous occasions\" be more clear? Or even less is more starting with \"You\". Just as a matter of  grammar I don't think you would add brackets to finish a sentence.",
