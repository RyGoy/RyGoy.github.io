   "message": "\"Also regardless of its mysterious origins, is it not possible to re divert the technocratic intent of the medium\"?\n\nNO! The fact that you ask this means you haven't grasped the mechanism.\n\nThe `96 \"paper\" (These are NOT colleagues, Their \"papers\" say nothing) you mention, speak of \"digital currencies\", not cryptography-based overlay networks.\n\nImplying that \"NSA\" or \"DARPA\" are even functioning on the same LEVEL as \"????\" reveals that you have put VERY FEW pieces together here.\n\nDo yourself a favour; NEVER EVER put GOVERNMENT and Satoshi Nakamoto, or any inference of a connection to government together again.\n\nYou have no idea why that's offensive, clearly. Just dump that line of thought, because all you do by having these \"ideas\" is reveal your profound ignorance of even the basic mechanism here.",
