I don't understand it\n\nThen, after assessing why I did that, I decided to force myself to accept it. The video actually opened up a lot of things to me, although I do not fully understand, I am actually beginning to think of the way that this platform could be used.\n\nThey mentioned DropBox, and other sites not having a 3rd party involved. AMAZING. I can see why this would be something Government doesn't want released, or why brainwashing would be such a powerful tool to do, as who could ever think there would be a place/time when Government was NOT involved in anyway.\n\nDropBox, FB, and other platforms are controlled, I understand that, and having a platform like this where there are 1000's and 1000's of possibilities to create new ways of peer to peer communication would create an alternative relationship without an Governing Agency holding both of their hands.\n\nI hope I have that right. Only watched it once, but I can see how powerful it is.",
