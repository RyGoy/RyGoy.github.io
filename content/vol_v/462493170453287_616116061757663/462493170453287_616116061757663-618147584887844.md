Bitcoin is the product of great minds... \n\nI just finished telling you to stop. You thought some gold shills are equal/better than me when it comes to this knowledge, so ask yourself what makes more sense:\n\n1: DARPA suddenly gets a pool of people who can think and it's and \"creates\" bitcoin.\nor\n2: People who sell gold don't like the competition, so they make shit up like you.\n\nWhich is more REASONABLE to \"believe\" (and it is belief. You DON'T have knowledge or I wouldn't be dealing with this shit stain you've left here)?",
