That's the PXE thing I was mentioning to Pete Daoust in one of his vanity posts filled with GPU porn.\n\nWE will be using GPXE and ALL of us will POOL the resources.\n\nWe will then make the Litecoin setup step back, and then make a CLUSTERED BITCOIN setup at THETENDERFORLAW.COM\n\nYOU decide what you want to mine today :D\n\nThis will be done with customized SLITAZ builds (slitaz.org)",
