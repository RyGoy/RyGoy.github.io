   "message": "Why the fuck do people think THEIR reasons for joining the group are even relevant. Here, let me check my care-factor meter:\n\n0 [.\\...........] 100\n\nNope. I clearly don't give a shit why Paul Wright joined the group. I usually presume that people are here because this is the only place you aren't lied to, or sold bullshit.\n\nIs there anyone else who feels like Paul Wright? Speak up you worthless cowards!\n\nI do feel obligated to respond as asked:\n\n\"who you calling stupid you ignorant fool.\" - Well I'm calling YOU stupid for not knowing where your CAPS key is, and not knowing what a question mark is. I love how barely literate people are always calling me \"ignorant\", when they clearly don't even know what the word means.\n\nWhen I call someone stupid, it's because they are stupid, and I explain WHY they are stupid (usually because I've dumbed things down so much it hurts, and they STILL don't get it). It's not just name-calling. If you have a weak mind and have no intention of CHANGING that state, then you get treated like the LESSER BEING (who ENABLES those I am fighting), that you are. This has been made VERY clear.\n\nAnd he gets all butt-hurt because HE joined the group to \"meet like minded people\"...which has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GROUP!",
