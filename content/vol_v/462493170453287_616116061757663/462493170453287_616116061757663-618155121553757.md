   "message": "If you think some idiots on a gold & silver forum know more than me, then go there. An idiotic hypothesis is still an idiotic hypothesis, even if you form it as a question.\n\nShit stains are NOT welcome here.\n\nImplications that the cryptographic currency that put the concept in the real world, came from the government is offensive in ways you are too dumb to understand.\n\nYour \"time will tell\" attitude means you think it's POSSIBLE that DARPA or Government is involved. This means you will always dedicate time to bullshit, and you are of no use here.",
