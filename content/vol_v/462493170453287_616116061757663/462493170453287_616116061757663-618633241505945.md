   "message": "Icbeonne Senama, good question. I went to Bitcoin Decentral last nite and both Vitalik and Antony spoke. My understanding is that Ethereum will be laid over the bitcoin protocol. it will be processor intensive ASIC mining making scrypt shovels much less effective. that is my understanding, if I have made a mistake please forgive. Scott Duncan, in what way will we need to modify the hardware we already have to so that we can most benefit from both the current scrypting duties to the future Ether beta release?",
