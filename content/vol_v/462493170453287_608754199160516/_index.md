   "message": "I get it. I really get it. I can't stand trying to talk to brick walls, glazed over eyes, minds that can't even grasp the simplest term... or ideas. This year, I am studying like my life depends on it. Which, I really know now that it does depend on it.\n\nTomorrow, I'm treating this group, like school... up at 9am... study for hours. No more messing around. \n\nScott, I don't know how you do it. Thank you, for drilling into our heads that we really do value the wrong things.",
