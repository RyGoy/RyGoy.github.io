   "message": "Remember you are fighting a 300 year-old program made by the Nobility. My time is limited, so be sure to make copies of everything I write. It's why I put the Creative Commons licence on it; they cannot attach the writing to commerce. They will make up bullshit like copyright, to seize it. So I stop it before it starts.\n\nI know how it ALL works, and I do everything I can, but war is coming, and they know I will be on the WRONG side.\n\nMost of you think I am talking \"crazy\"...at the moment. They always do.\n\nWatch out for the coming \"you were right\" crowd. You know them as the \"eyes-glazed-over\" and \"brick wall\" people you just mentioned. DON'T TRUST THEM if they suddenly \"see the light\". Your insight is no match for their 300 year-old, refined programming, and it's hubris to think they are.\n\nHalf of those \"close\" to me, will sell me out the second they feel it's too much. Others will try to \"lay low\"; Peter Mansfield is a good example. When they see what I/you say is real, it scares them. Fear cannot be trusted. You CAN trust that they will be afraid.",
