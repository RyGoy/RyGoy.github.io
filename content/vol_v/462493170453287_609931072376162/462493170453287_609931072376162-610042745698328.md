   "message": "I remember talking to a cop once. I was complaining that a construction company was working overnight and keeping us all awake. The cop said the site foreman said he had a permit . I told the cop I checked and they didn't' and that the foreman had lied and what was he going to do about it. The cop said it wasn't an offence to lie to a cop. So I said I wanted him to do something about the noise all through the night and he said it was a civil matter. I said I was planning to dig up my driveway at 3am the next night with a jack hammer and what would happen if a neighbour complained , he said I'de be arrested, FUCKING RETARD !",
