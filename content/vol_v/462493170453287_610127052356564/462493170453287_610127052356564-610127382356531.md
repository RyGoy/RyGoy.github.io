   "message": "01-09-2014   �   Daily Paul.com \n\n  \nIt seems almost impossible to believe that the exact strategy being employed by the US Federal Reserve to ostensibly help the economy was also employed by Nazi Germany to dismantle the British economy. But it is absolutely true.\n\nOperation Bernhard, named for it's mastermind, Bernhard Kr�ger, was a Nazi program to print millions of British Pounds and send them to Britain. The forgeries were so perfect that no one could tell the difference, and it was their plan that this \"quantitative easing\" would unhinge the economy through inflation, causing people to do all kinds of stupid things with their money and quit producing things of value.",
