   "message": "Imagine how many \"change everything\" events the current legal system can withstand. Remember, in Webcapades v. Duncan, (Hacking a spammer) most people didn't even HAVE email, muchless grasp the damage spammers do. The law took 20 years to catch up to fucking EMAIL. Any legal framework that exists NOW, covering the internet, is made from knee-jerk flawed over-reactions to perceived \"threats\", and they do nothing but hemorrhage money. How well will they handle 20 \"change everything\" events in a 5 year period?\n\nHow about 50?\n\nI've already won.",
