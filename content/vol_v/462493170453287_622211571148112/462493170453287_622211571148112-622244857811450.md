   "message": "The biggest difference I see is that instead of asking a few big loan sharks \"Which of you will lend me money to build a home?\" and having a hired group of thugs to enforce that you give them WAY more than you borrowed because you can't pay it all at once, you can now ask many to help and if you don't pay them back, they just simply will not trust you ever again. No big banksters and no mindless policy enforcement to run around intimidating people. Of course you should still be careful what you ask for, and most people will still want something in return for what they lend. It will be direct and there isn't just a few at the top sifting all the gain off of the many at the bottom.",
