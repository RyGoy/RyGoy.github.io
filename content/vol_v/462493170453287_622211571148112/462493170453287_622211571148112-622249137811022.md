   "message": "Eamonn, I farmed and mastered a trade, Tinsmith. I, over the years became good at other trades as well, plumbing, carpentry, electrical, roofing, paper and wire for stucco, a handyman type. If you were here, I would work for you for coin. I think that I could make other tradesmen see the Value in this too. What I'm saying here is that many of us have the skills to build and are willing to accept a NEW currency system free from all the thieving hands of parasites with psychopathic armed thugs collecting. Whether it is building with wood, concrete, steel, computers or minds, the opportunity is there NOW, and I want to work with it. As far as the loan for the house, if it was just hard times and the future looked good ahead for you, I would not be worried if I lent some coin. I would have had more than I needed and it does me no good sitting idle, so pay me when you can again. If you just flat out refuse, then you really should sell the house to clear the debt and get back to the Fiat system, RFN! Just kidding! Common sense would prevail in this new system. Imagine THAT!",
