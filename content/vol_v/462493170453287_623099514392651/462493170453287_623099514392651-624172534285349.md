The term usually refers to a company that does not produce goods or services itself; rather, its purpose is to own shares of other companies. Holding companies allow the reduction of risk for the owners and can allow the ownership and control of a number of different companies. In the United States, 80% or more of stock, in voting and value, must be owned before tax consolidation benefits such as tax-free dividends can be claimed.[1]\n\nSometimes a company intended to be a pure holding company identifies itself as such by adding \"Holdings\" or \"(Holdings)\" to its name.",
