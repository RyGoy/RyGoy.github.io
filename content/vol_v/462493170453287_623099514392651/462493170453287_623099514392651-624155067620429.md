   "message": "Here's a concern ive had to complicate things.  Scott describes \"charges\" often being made to a newly created  person/entity.  I have looked at statements coming my way, and the name does not appear as does the name for the person on the B/C.  Is it possible we are being contacted for surety for a person we have no authority to Administrate for?  or am i being retarded again?",
