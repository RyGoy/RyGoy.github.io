   "message": "I have a hydro bill. But the only part that says bill is in a box. From what I am understanding the bill is not on that page. It says Bill Issue Date in a box. In that box is an all caps name but no amount. Just the words Bill Issue Date: Jan 31, 2014, but since it's not on that page and nothing on that page says BILL, I'm guessing it's not a bill.",
