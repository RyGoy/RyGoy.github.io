   "message": "I make a portion of my money babysitting. If my hydro is off the parents won't let me babysit their kids obviously. If I miss out on that money, I won't have enough bus fare to get to my other work. And then I wouldn't be able to pay my rent. Also my roomate is concerned as well and wanted me to be sure that people are doing this in Ontario.",
