I understand that the person i administrate which is owned by you owes money or needs to make a payment. I have completed the cheque. Please honour it and pay this hydro company from the account you own which I administrate. Thanks. LOVE Lana. Do I have to give them any further instructions. Of course I'd clean this up a bit. Are there any more important things I need to tell them to do or have to explain?",
