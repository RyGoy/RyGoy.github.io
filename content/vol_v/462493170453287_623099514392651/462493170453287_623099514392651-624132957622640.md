   "message": "I'm looking through threads and I don't see any comments so far of anyone else saying that they are administering debts the way Pete does and saying they have had the same success. I am ready to do it but I'm a scared and would be encouraged to hear that pretty much everyone is doing it and has succeeded in administrating their debts in the same way. I know things work a bit different in Quebec and I'm from Ontario. How many from Ontario are succeeding and having this administrative process recognized and accepted as payment. I spoke to hydro about me not being the person on their bill. They said if LANA DUKAKIS is not a person who wants hydro they can cut my hydro service off. I don't want my service cut off and have to turn it on again. There are a lot of extra charges for that. They said they would need a large deposit as well which I can't afford if they turn the hydro off. I guess I would just like to be assured that there are lots of people doing this in Ontario. :)",
