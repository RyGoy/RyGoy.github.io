   "message": "I was a good, obedient, people pleasing slave...for way too long.\n\nRespect authority/respect your elders was a common catch cry from my parents (and others)...my first bit of defiance began with the question:\n\nWhat if my 'elder' is a murderer?  (I didn't know about paedophile priests at that age).\n\nI noticed the inconsistencies of 'don't talk to strangers & don't take lollies/candy from strangers'...but here, come & sit on Santa's lap.\n\nI knew enough to be suspicious but not enough to know why, not enough to play dumb, but enough to begin to observe the hypocrisy in play...but could never attain sufficient clarity on my own.\n\nThank you for your clear, concise explanations Admiral, so much clarity for so many of the inconsistencies that never made sense growing up.",
