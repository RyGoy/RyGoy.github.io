   "message": "ConClusion\nWhy do corporations incorporate in Delaware? There is not one answer but many. They include a modern and nationally recognized corporation statute and a well-developed case law that facilitates business planning; the respected Court of Chancery to deal with corporation law issues should they arise; an efficient and user-friendly Secretary of State�s Office; and a legislature that puts a high priority on corporation law matters and is committed to keeping Delaware�s business laws current.\nCertainly, some of the parts of the package that encourage companies to incorporate in Delaware can be imitated, even duplicated. But most of them cannot. In any case, the total package, and the synergies that its various parts lend to one another, make Delaware the premier home for corporations today.\nIt is also likely that Delaware will continue to enjoy its enviable position. Bayless Manning, the former Dean of Stanford Law School, stated it perfectly when he described the synergies that cause him to recommend Delaware to his clients. After saying some nice things about Delaware lawyers, he went on to say, in words that describe Delaware�s attraction almost as a force of nature: �Further, my Delaware counsel and I will have a wide ranging and sophisticated body of corporation law�a jurisprudence if you will�to bring to bear on almost any problem that will arise. No other jurisdiction can provide so much. And that is why Delaware is national and why its own gravitational pull tends to attract more companies each year and thereby, further reinforces its preeminence.�\n-Lewis S. Black Jr",
