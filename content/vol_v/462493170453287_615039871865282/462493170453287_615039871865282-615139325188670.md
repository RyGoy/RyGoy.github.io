   "message": "Beverly Berta Braakschmack now my question is... can 8903857 Ontario Ltd. get a drivers license?\n\nThe private trust holds the licence (of the person)\n\nYou, acting in the capacity of trustee, are entitled to use trust property as per your private trustee agreement (in this case the car and the licence).\n\nIf/when you are stopped, you show the pirate the trust property (licence) and if a penalty/ticket is issued, the board of trustees (you as a trustee) can determine whether there is any case to answer: eg: injured party, loss etc.\n\nAfter all, you are only administrating trust assets :D",
