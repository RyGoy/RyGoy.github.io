   "message": "Liens on court actions?\n\nI've been pondering the inner workings of our so called justice systems and how they rake in revenue.\n\nIt occurred to me that when an order is issued by a MASTER/JUSTICE, the original blue ink signature copy of the order is never given to the \"winning\" party, whether plaintiff or defendant.\n\nI suspected these are valuable SIGNED negotiable instruments THEY cash in on. What happens in the actual action matters little, as all they are after are those signed judgements. Who knows what is really going on there, but I'd sure like know.\n\nWith that said, is it possible to get THEM to cough up the signed ORIGINAL order? \n\nWhat is it true value? Is it a security someone could use to setoff accounts with? I doubt you cash it in at your local bank..\n\nIt's easy to get lost in the possibilities.\n\nSo let's say a particular entity has a security agreement for large sums of \"money\" owing from a certain legal person and has gone ahead and gave the world public notice of that security interest VIA a lien registered.\n\nCould the interest holder not lien ANY court action involving the respective legal person whether that person was plaintiff or defendant in said action?\n\nWould the lien holder not have a CLAIM to ALL funds generated from the commercial energy behind the legal person? Who could claim a paramount interest to the secured creditor? What proof would they have? None, I would suspect...\n\nSo a civil or criminal action gets a lien slammed against it - What happens? Does it affect the outcome of the action? For who? Why?\n\n;)\n\nThoughts? Scott - care to comment?",
