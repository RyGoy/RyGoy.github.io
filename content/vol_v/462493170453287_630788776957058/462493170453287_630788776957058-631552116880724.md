   "message": "dog year relativity. no exact science but your comparing hours clocked for your array i presume against the hours of a human.\n\nI have actually pondered what would happen when someone finally calculates the caloric cost of a human doing work and basing a value against that relative to work labor (lacking thought) and came up with a payment schedule based on the actual physical value contribution a human does. for instance, if all you needed was bricks moved from point A to point B you care not who the human is that actually performs the work, and you base the rate of compensation value determined by the output capacity of the human and not his capability to think because thinking is irrelevent for moving a brick. you pick it up travel it, and put it down, somthing a monkey can do.\n\nso what it comes down to is simply value for horsepower or BTU.\n\nif gasoline and alcohol cost exactly the same, alcohol contains only 75% of the potential energy of gasoline molecule to molecule, neither is more difficult to handle or manage than the other, you would buy the gasoline because to buy alcohol is throwing 25% out the window, comparatively speaking.",
