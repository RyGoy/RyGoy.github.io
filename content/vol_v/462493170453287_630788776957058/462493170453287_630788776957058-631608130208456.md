   "message": "the problem arises with the idea of exchange or comparison to legal tender. IF Bev could use the currency to get something she wanted or needed, then she has value in what she received. Looking even deeper into this, FN are fiat, so really they are worth less then the dogecoin which is based on the value Pete and Bev hold....am I accurate in my thinking?",
