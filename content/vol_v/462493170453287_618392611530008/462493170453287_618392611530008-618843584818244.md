   "message": "There is this whole \"new\" anti-bullying bullshit policy being implemented in the schools. They actually expelled a friend of my daughter for being part of a conversation that they deemed to be bullying..........NOT during school hours AND apparently she said nothing threatening. I HATE the victim bullshit all the anti-bullying bullshit propagates. Funny thing is all the adults who get involved usually do most of the bullying. Anyway, the picture you posted made me think of that. Long live Amanda. Oh wait, nevermind. She'll never know how famous she was.",
