The only time I've heard him mention them was  ONE time, on an obscure radio interview he did. To be fair, he DID mention them....but why not flaunt it as another victory ???  I guess there's no point in asking for a file number associated with them, eh ?  It took 10 months for anyone to post the number from Feb....lol.   Maybe if I sign the \"non disclosure\" agreement I'll become privy to it.   :D",
