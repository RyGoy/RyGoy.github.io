   "message": "Loving it!!!\n\nThanks for laying it all out coherently and in one place...\n\nOnly two (minor) points for clarification:\n\n1.  Does the sole shareholder 'own' the corporation?  I know it is pedantic, but I thought the term ownership was considered erroneous...based on the concept of own nothing, control everything.\n\n2.  I would prefer to trade in Boobies Bucks instead of Bobcoin...if possible could you forward an exchange rate?\n\nSeriously though, nice work & much value added, thank you :D",
