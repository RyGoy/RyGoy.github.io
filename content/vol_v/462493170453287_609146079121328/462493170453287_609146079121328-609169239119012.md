   "message": "So now we have a covenant that has defined all the roles of the trust by an agreement or covenant. The grantor and creator= the person in your back pocket is finished we never see him again, except as per wishes of the creator and grantorï¿½\nDo not worry, I do to want to confuse.\nThe person in the back pocket needs a rest.\nSo he sleeps in his office as Vice president or simply a Director of the duly authorized  trustee corporation. He also may like weed and hookers so we let  him play. He doesn't really do any thing anyway he is  Lazy.\nThis is also established in the covenant.\nAs well as assigning brand shiny new name the title of first director or something similar.",
