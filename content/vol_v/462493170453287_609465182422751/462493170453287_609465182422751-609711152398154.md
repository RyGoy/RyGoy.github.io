   "message": "I certainly am not answering for Scott, but will share my comprehension of what I've hear him saying. I'm in Canada, I'm not sure of the equivalent agents are in the US...what seems to be the issue is first public or private debt. If you owe the plumber money for work done on your  home, that is private debt that we are responsible for...payment is contracted before the services are rendered. If the plumber is willing to accept a BoE (ie signed bill) then all is well in using it. Terms are contracted for private debt. \n\nFor public debt, and I may be a bit off here but A4V I think is processed through the consolidated revenue fund, which is funded by taxes and tax payers. The issue with this is the tax payers are paying your public debt which then removes funds from the system that can benefit all people. \n\nThe administration that Pete does, to my  understanding, is with the intention that the Bank of Canada will create the funds to cover the public debt you are submitting. No 'hardship' is created for others as a result. \n\nI'm not positive I have the correct understanding and don't want to create any shit stains, I'm happy to be corrected :)",
