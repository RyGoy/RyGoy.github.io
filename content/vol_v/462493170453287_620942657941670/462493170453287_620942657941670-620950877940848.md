   "message": "You have to start at the beginning.  Say you have half a cup of money and a cup of debt. When money is created it is essentially creating more debt. So if you create more and more debt or MONEY. MONEY=DEBT.\nYOU CAN NEVER DISCHARGE IT. Your half cup of money/value stays at half a cup. But your cup of debt becomes a cup and a half or two cups. Because you're not CREATING VALUE when you create MONEY.... \nYou are creating debt. So yea she got a check. But the cashing or spending it is where the problem is. SOMEONE ALONG THE LINE HAS TO DISCHARGE THE MONEY CREATED. So WHO is left to discharge the debt. Creator? Gone. Signing parties? Gone. So who's surety for the debt? YOU? ME? Well NO certainly NOT ME! BUT WAIT..... MAYBE YOU! I'm positive there is a document out there that shows who the surety is. But I didn't have anything to do with that!!",
