   "message": "\"Did you know that INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE/SLAVERY it's in place, and that we are almost ALL participating by consent?\" That should had been the first, and only fucking question. :/\n\nAt the end, this anonymouse work is BULLSHIT. It's all written from the point of view of some impotent slave, that does not realize he IS a slave. A \"house nigger\" slave that knows his masters rules very well. \n\nWhen one knows it's all about surety and accounting, what other \"secrets\" are there to tell about \"courts\"? Who cares about \"their\" clubhouse rules?! :D Those are there to CONFUSE and DECEIVE, and are NOT meant for US. Plus, they are not following the own rules, anyways.\n\nInvoluntary servitude. To me, that's the bottom line, everything else is there to DISTRACT us from seeing REALITY, that INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE it's HERE.\n\nLife is NOT about \"THEM\", or \"THEY\", or their clubhouse rules. Life is about ME! And it's our LIFE that has been stolen from US. \n\nPS: You can't \"chew\" information. Just sayin'.",
