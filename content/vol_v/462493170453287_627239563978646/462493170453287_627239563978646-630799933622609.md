   "message": "Thats what it is. Tabernacle used to be known as some stupid piece of church dishes I think... But Quebec'ers we highly disrespect church and not only do we swear using their words, when we pronounce them we make sure they sound like straight outta hell... So the \"pleasefatherfuckmyvirginass\" cute word \"tabernacle\" we pronounce TABARNAK and that usually marks the end of whatever was said before.\n\nThis definitely needs to be in Pete 's dictionary\n\nTABARNAK\n\ndefinition :\nYou fucktard are a fucktard",
