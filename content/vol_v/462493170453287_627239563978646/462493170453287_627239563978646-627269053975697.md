   "message": "So I can say to a cop and others that they have no right to use my picture for ANY reason without a written release form signed by the administrator for the name and or image. Especially to identify \"me\". Somewhere I watched a court video where a justice was given a copy of a drivers license by a prosecutor and when the \"defendant\" wouldn't agree to being acknowledged as being the person on the drivers license the justice said that he could tell by the photo on the license that the image proved that the man in court was IN FACT the person who was before him and the the person mentioned in the charge.",
