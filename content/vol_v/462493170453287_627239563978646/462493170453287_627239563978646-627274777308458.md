   "message": "Once your affidavit declares/proves that you were born on a different date than the PERSON, it's clear that the PERSON isn't you, and that it cannot have the face and cannot sign the name which would appear on any ID... \n\nYOU can sign and it's YOUR face there... Not the PERSON'S which cannot have a face... So the image and signature would only identify the ADMINISTRATOR for the PERSON, and you have to serve them (those who issued those IDs) proofs of that fact, and ask for forgiveness if you or someone else somehow misled them to think it was you. \n\nThat's why I want to have the notary to witness the affidavit which I'm sending them to be unrebutted so that I can use it as needed as a proof. Hopefully that will be easier than my experience with the car's license plate renewal :(",
