   "message": "Scott \n\nI am thinking that I might want to create an affidavit which is supported by two people who have known me for quite a while stating that I am my taken name and not my given name because I want proof that I am not the given name or the name on the birth certificate. But I don�t want to waste my money if doing this won�t serve me very much.\n\nBut that is where I get confused again. :(\n\nSo here are my questions to help me to understand:\n\n1. I am guessing that I always should do commercial stuff using the name on my BC. Is that correct?\n2. If not, how do I get the banks to accept my affidavit of identity and or identification as they want government issued ID and my legal name. (I tried to use my taken name before a few times and was told that if I want to use my taken name that I have to legally change my name on my birth certificate)\n3. Should I and can I claim ownership of all images of my body in the affidavit? Here I�m thinking of famous sports people who sue people who post their image without permission and win in the courts because somehow they have reserved all rights to their image or something to that effect.\n4. If I create such an affidavit, what are the advantages and uses of it and for it?\n\nAny help and guidance here is very much appreciated. :)",
