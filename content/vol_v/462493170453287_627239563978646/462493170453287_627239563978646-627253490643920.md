   "message": "I was speaking to a friend about wanting to reserve the rights to my image. He told me that it reminded him of when the Formula 1 races were in Toronto they put a huge very tall fence around the racetrack in Toronto. According to him the organizers somehow managed to LEGALLY deny people to access that part of the city and to take pictures of that part of the city and the race cars, race car drivers,  etc. if the picture was taken outside of the fenced in area. WTF? He said that the sponsors of the race legally made sure that the \"people\" had no right to access that part of the city or take pictures of that part of the city. He also said that a few people who took pictures of the drivers, cars etc and put them on the web were threatened with legal action because they had no right to take pictures or publish pictures of that part of the city or of the drivers, the cars etc.",
