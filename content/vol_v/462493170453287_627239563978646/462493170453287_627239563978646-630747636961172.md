   "message": "@Lana. We have a certified photocopied image of our birth entry in the Birth Registry ... it is the data of this entry from which is created the [fraudulent] Birth Extract and Birth Certificate. Your original Birth Entry evidences the true identity as a living entity of body, mind and spirit. However, we are still trying to get a certified copy of the Birth Notification Form, or what ever it may be entitled, provided by the hospital to the informant to use as evidence to Register a Birth. That instrument will also evidence the true identity of a living human.\nWe invite Scott and/or Peter to comment on this.",
