   "message": "KnownAs Colin, I contacted Dept of BDM in NSW by email and asked for the record of live birth.\n\nThe first employee played dumb & was dumb or dishonest, so I clarified by saying the record held by the Dept of BDM that provided the information that the Birth Certificate was created from.\n\nIt was subsequently mailed to me via the person in my pocket.  I do not recall if there was a fee for the service, if so I expect it was the same fee as purchasing a copy of the Birth Certificate.\n\nHope that helps ;)",
