   "message": "I've been asking questions to the registrar general here in Qc since december. Ask Pete Daoust at one point I was literally putting him in a very tight corner... And at that point, he suggested I ask a lawyer to help me with my questions... I insisted, gave him a full month to get back to me, now I'm seeing a notary tomorrow, sending him a default notice, and an affidavit stating my conclusions based on facts. If they dont rebute it, I'm thinking of having the unrebutted affidavit notarised as well and intend to use this as proof anytime I have to... So Scott Duncan's answer will be welcome here too ;)",
