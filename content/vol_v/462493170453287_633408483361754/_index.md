   "message": "Hey everyboby, this is my first post since joining the group a few weeks ago, I just like to express my thanks to Scott Duncan Tara Duncan Pete Daoust and everyone else who are making this place what it is and I feel very lucky to be here learning from you guys.\n\nI have a Dogecoin wallet with 40k Doge in it (having trouble getting the wallet.dat to open on my laptop but ill get it). Last week I sent my incorporation papers off to Delaware and other than that im just trying to keep up and read everything I can, you guys are fucking hilarious btw. (; I see more and more everyday how I value(d)the wrong things and its my wish to ditch the programming that enslaves me and have an original thought before I die. \n\nA bit about me; Im 22yrs old, born in Toronto and raised in Quebec, still live in QC but often travel to TO with my dad where I work in the bullshit factory know as the film industry as a carpenter or labourer. I lived a pretty sheltered childhood, Ive always been shy and introverted but it wasn't until I entered the public fool system that I developed the feelings of alienation and social aversion that I have now. I think I lost interest in that racket in 1st grade when the teacher looked at me like an idiot for saying that plants needed air.  Before stumbling on this place I was a regular on Deans forum, I first heard about him last February when he got arrested and immediately \"dove in\" thinking \"This is It!\", before that I was kinda lost and aimless so decided to learn computers and philosophy (didn't get too far), before that I was messed up on drugs and before that I was an underage stoner.",
