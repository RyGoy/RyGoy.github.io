   "message": "Ok, at the risk of more arrogant, smart ass responses, I've got a few questions. The only way to lean is to ask right... So here we go. \nIf I'm the AGENT for the principle or the sole authorized administrator; then all bills or charges are not for me, they are for the principle right? Or the AGENCY however you want to say it. If I'm acting as their agent then how do I send the agency the bill or charges? \nSecondly) if I'm the administrator of something I did not create, then that authority was granted to me correct? Someone have the analogy of a fed note, but that was GIVEN to me as well to administer for a designed purpose. Therefore, I only have the authority to administer as the creator of the (person) grants. Where can I find the terms or conditions? \nLastly) how do I use this knowledge in court? I want results. I want to win. All of this theory is nice but if I can't back it up by real world application, then it's shit. Thanks for all the help, let the condescending arrogant comments roll! Lol",
