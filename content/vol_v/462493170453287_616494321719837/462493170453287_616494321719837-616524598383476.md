   "message": "The whole system is commerce. In order to partake in commerce you need a person. All bills are addressed to whatever person was used to initiate the commercial relationship i.e. Mr. Mathew Wolfe...\n\nThe only right you have is the right not to contract with the person. Once you do contract with the person the t's & c's are outlined in government statute books or whatever commercial rulebook the person you are dealing with has set out.\n\nThe point is not to go to court Mathew. Win by staying at home. Most cases are civil in nature thus requiring a contract that usually doesn't exist. Put the burden of proof on them by demanding evidence that you are SURETY for the person relating to the charges... \n\nI hope this helps... :)",
