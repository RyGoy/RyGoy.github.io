   "message": "Scott, here is how I would send .exe files being a complete computer idiot.  I would watch a video online.  I would say \"jeez....that was pretty good.  I am going to download those.\"  Then I download them and keep them on file for a long time.  Then I get a virus that messes with my files and does something like this.  Then someone asks me for them and I agree and send them completely oblivious to the .exe and what it means.  \n\nI don't know if this is possible or probable..but with my novice experience I could see it happening.  Thoughts?",
