   "message": "Yes Pete Daoust  I just sent an invoice for $6.730.000 (for forcible confinement under the crown, carried away by fraud and criminal breach of the trust) lawful monies of Canada to the CRA. They have 26 days left before notice of fault. Thereafter 10 days till default. I sent an affidavit of obligation along with the invoice and public notice. What I'm doing is called OPCA litigation and vexatious so to avoid that title and cause for another invoice I stated at the bottom (current invoice) this bill may be forgiven on condition of discharge (servitude) and return of wages negotiated in good faith.",
