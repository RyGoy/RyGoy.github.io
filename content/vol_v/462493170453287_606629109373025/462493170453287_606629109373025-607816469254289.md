   "message": "Interesting...a few things I noticed:\n\nThe guy needs to choose a different second name for his undercover entity...\n\nI hope any cops viewing that documentary notice a few things:\n\n1.  Their colleagues are going to turn on them, hang them out to dry & shitcan them whenever things start to go against them\n\n2.  No 'activist' was ever committed of any crime for the 7 years this cop spent undercover.\n\n3.  The supposed bad guys (activist) demonstrated far more love, care and attention than the people employing this cop to do a job.\n\n...loyalty, care, commitment, morals & ethics don't come as the result of a paycheck...they come as the result of doing what is right.",
