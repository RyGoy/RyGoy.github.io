   "message": "\"Sections 411 and 415 do not clearly declare but at least imply that there may be two kinds of �FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES�: 1) �federal reserve notes� (under Section 411) and 2) �Federal Reserve notes� (under Section 415). If so, the 411-frn�s are �obligations of the United States� that can be used to pay taxes and are also redeemable in �lawful money of the United States� while the 415-FRn�s appear to be private currency of the Federal Reserve banks that are not expressly suitable for paying taxes, and aren�t redeemable in �lawful money� (gold or silver coin).\"\nhttp://adask.wordpress.com/2008/08/16/federal-reserve-notes-federal-reserve-notes/",
