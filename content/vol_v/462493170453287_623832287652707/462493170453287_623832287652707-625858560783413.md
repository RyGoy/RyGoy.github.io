   "message": "As fiat continues to crack & falls apart, people (individuals, groups & governments) are going to be trying to get their cash into anything & everything else...BTC, Doge, Gold, silver, food, cigarettes, petrol etc etc...ALL of those  other 'currencies' are going to rise in (perceived) value.\n\nIt's not about doing things perfectly, or searching for just one magic bullet, it's about developing a strategy that puts us ahead of the masses...and once we can take care of ourselves, we can then help our nearest & dearest & then the greater community, to the extent we choose.\n\nThat's just my opinion... ;-)",
