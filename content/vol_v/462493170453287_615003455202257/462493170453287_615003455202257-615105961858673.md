   "message": "What are you talking about? \"Person in my pocket?\" I have no person in my pocket. I am not a person (corporate fiction). But I am a natural person. What definition are we using? In fact the man vs person argument lands people in jail more times than not. What title or jurisdiction do I act through? If I find myself in court facing statutory charges, they must presume I was acting as their agent in some way. Can the prosecutor prove this? No. Therefore the court has a duty as the trustee to protect my rights. I'm seeking information on how to seek remedy when they fail to perform this duty. \n\nAs far as your question on receiving \"bills\" for the \"person\"; I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but when I'm given a bill that I feel is given by mistake, I start my administrative process. I send them notice of conditional acceptance. I'll accept their bill and agree to pay if they can provide me with proof of my obligation to do so. When they fail to respond I default them. This establishes agreement of the parties. This my evidence should they take legal actions against me for failure To pay  or perform. This would also by my evidence in my claim when I allege harm would it not?",
