   "message": "Mathew Wolfe, you have a grasp that you are not the name, nor are you surety for the name...but the name is considered a person...that person often exists in your pocket in the form of a drivers licence, a medicare card, birth certificate, passport or some other state created legal fiction.\n\nYou are correct in that you are not that person...but you hold the position of sole authorised administrator for that person (unless someone else is entitled to hold those documents as well).\n\nAs you are sole authorised administrator for the name/person, you can administrate shit for that person.\n\nSo, when a bill is sent for that person, you can administrate it as an inchoate bill of exchange.\n\nWhen a driving charge is levelled against the person, you can accept the charge & have it administrated and discharged.\n\nAfter all, the signatory on the birth certificate that was created 12 to 16 days after you were born, has agreed to act as surety for that person.  \n\nThat person was created by the state/province.  It says so on the top of the birth certificate.\n\nAll other public documents are derived directly or indirectly from that initial document.\n\nIf you claim that you are that name, that is at the very least negligent misrepresentation, but more likely it's fraud.\n\nBut as the legal holder in due course of that person, you have some sort of obligation to administrate matters for it, so part of the learning is learning how to administrate shit.\n\nBut as Pete Daoust says, it's ok if you don't know this, it's not my fault :D",
