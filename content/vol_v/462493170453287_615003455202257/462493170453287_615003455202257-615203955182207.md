   "message": "If you have made a private claim that the other party has defaulted on, you have 3 main choices:\n\n1.  Do nothing\n2.  Deal with it in the private realm by getting them in default, then liening their property for the agreed upon value of the damages.\n3.  Take it into the public realm where skilled and paid actors will weave wordspells that you have little, if any success in unravelling.  Somewhere, at some time, you will make a mistake & then you will lose (most of the time anyway) and bad things happen.\n\nHere, we deal with number 2 & ward off attacks by administrating shit & reminding the other party that we are not the name/person...because we are learning/have learnt who we are and how to be responsible men & women.",
