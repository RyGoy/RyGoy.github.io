   "message": "Its funny you mention that Pierre, i too received an offer-to-contract with the PERSON i have for Jury Duty (a 'Jury Notice')...here's what i sent back:\n\nNOTICE OF CONDITIONAL-ACCEPTANCE\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED � WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n\nNOTICE TO AGENT IS NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL � NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL IS NOTICE TO AGENT\n\nThe Sheriff of Ontario\nHighest governmental-authority of common law on the land\nSheriff�s Office\nc/o Provincial Jury Centre\nPO Box 666(666?...hmm, that�s rather disturbing � why would they give you guys a PO Box # that is the Mark-of-the-BEAST??), STN A\nOshawa ON L1H 9Z9\n  \n   I just wanted to let you guys know that I am very much alive-and-well, I have not beene absent from my land and/or estate�I have not perished in �The Great Fire of the sovereign-city-state of London, England of which the Guild the British Accreditation Registry is based from out of�and I have not gone �Lost-at-sea.� I mention this, because I noticed the way my name was spelled in the envelope sent to my home was misspelled; for greater certainty, it was spelled in all-capital-letters. I only bring this up because, section 9.2 of Regulation 181 of the Corporations Act of Ontario states: (2)  The name of a corporation shall be set out in an application filed under the Act in block capital letters and with only one space between each word. \n\n   That being all said, I would be happy, more than happy, and conditionally-accept the offer to be a part of some other Man, Woman and/or people�s jury �of-their-peerage for them to ensure that they receive a FAIR-and-IMPARTIAL proceeding. However there seems to be a problem in that, it seems only a PERSON can be a part of �jury duty.� And the last time I checked, the Legislation Act 2006 for the PROVINCE OF ONTARIO, taking into account the Maxim-of-law that INCLUDES is based upon, says that a: �person� (is/means) a corporation.\n\n   Another problem is that, the offer-to-contract that you guys mailed to my home, has offered in it no consideration to me. One of the elements of a valid contract, is that both sides have to be receiving consideration from each other which ultimately, leads them both to a consensus ad idem. Im actually not looking for any �money�/legal tender, but here are my Terms-and-Conditions:\n\n� (1) I spend no more than 5 business-days in �the jury pool� down at University Avenue in Toronto, Ontario (2) TTC tokens provided for me in order to get back-and-forth to jury-duty from my home (3) a $15 or whatever is the lawful-currency of the day per diem for me to get something to eat-and-drink during meal-breaks (4) meal-breaks (5) the ability to leave if an urgent matter comes up that I must attend to (6) access to view and/or make copies of the court-file and/or any-and-all documents concerning the proceedings I recently made a request for from the Clerk of the Court of Equity in Toronto, Ontario \n\nThank you, and Happy-belated Labour Day Weekend to you and all in your office,\n\nBy: NON ASSUMPSIT, WITHOUT PREJUDICE, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\nDerekMoran, Grantor, sole-living-life-In Being-Contingent Beneficiary-of-a-Future Interest, a people",
