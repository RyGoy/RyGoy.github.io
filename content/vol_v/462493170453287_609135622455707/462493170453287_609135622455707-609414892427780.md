   "message": "no, i was more like, the judge explained that you have to use circumstantial evidence to help decide a case, and i asked him where does the law say that, so he read it from the book directions from judge to jury, and asked me if i could follow his instructions, and i said i would have a hard time convicting based on circumstantial evidence and i gasped the word *ridiculous* outloud in the courtroom when he said it was actually a law.",
