   "message": "My Father died last year. He left his estate to me and my sister and made me the executor of his last will and testament.\n\nHe left his money, a number of items of furniture, and the bulk of his estate. Example�half the house, half a vacation property in Florida, half the value of cars, half of the bank accounts and investments etc.\n\nAfter my dad�s death, my stepmother, and my step brother and sister immediately cut off communication with me. They hired a lawyer and all communication has been through their lawyer.\n\nI have not received anything from my Dad�s estate as per his will. They have sold the house, emptied all the bank accounts and liquidated all of his (their co-owned) assets.\n\nEssentially, their lawyer says that his will is worthless and be entirely ignored due to �rights of survivorship� which says that the surviving spouse gets all the deceased spouses assets.\n\nAfter almost a year of trying to get them to recognise the will and provide me with bank statements etc so I can settle the estate, they will not even respond to my letters, phone calls etc.\n\nLegally, I am responsible to settle the estate as per his final wishes. Also, I am obligated to do his final taxes (including estate taxes etc). I can�t do this because I cannot obtain any of the info that I need.\n\nI want to charge them criminally, but I�m not sure what acts and statutes, criminal code sections I should reference when I inform a JP and submit an application to charge her criminally.\n\nI�m desperate at this point and I don�t know what sections of statutes etc to cite.\n\nAny and all help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
