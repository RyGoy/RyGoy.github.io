   "message": "IMHO, Never keep your currency in any exchange, use the exchange, then secure said exchange off line. I looked into the Vault of Satoshi, the services they provide are expensive, they want ID (Government ID) and all that info you give them is held by them on their servers. That is not secure, that in fact make you a potential target for the Government as they could seize those servers and all the info they contain.",
