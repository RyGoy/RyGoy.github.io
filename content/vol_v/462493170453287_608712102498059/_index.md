   "message": "If the McDonalds' Corporation were to install Speed Limit signs (in their Drive throughs) at say 2 KM/hr - and had installed speed cameras that caught you doing 5 KMs/hr, could they send you a FINE for say $400.00 and expect you to pay it?\n\nWhat if they 'did a deal' with SPER (here in Qld's), in a money making exercise whereby they sold that 'perceived' debt onto them (for say, 30c in the dollar), could you lose your car for not paying SPER's demand?\n\nIsn't that what is happening - and what Queensland Motorway Pty Ltd (a private company) have done with their privately owned roads and Toll ways?",
