   "message": "I bought one of those AntMiner U1 usb Asic things. It was on sale for 999 baht. (About 30 dollars) I will mine some of the low diff sha-256 coins like orobit. It is 1.6 GH/s But can be overclocked to 2.2... There are a few more of this type of coin. Plan is to use them on exchanges... you know get things flowing via trade.",
