The more the \"sheeple\" see cryptocurrency being used ALL OVER THE WEB as well as in physical locations, the more they'll accept it and want to learn about them.\n\nIf you have a business, start exchanging cryptocurrency, even on a small scale - the words \"We accept bitcoin!\", maybe \"We accept dogecoin!\" should be prominently displayed in every entrance.\n\nAbout 2,330,000 results = google search for \"we accept bitcoin\" - what will that number be 1 year from now???\n\nhttps://www.google.com/#q=%22we+accept+bitcoin%22",
