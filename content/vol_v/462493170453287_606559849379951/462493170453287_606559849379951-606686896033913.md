   "message": "So... just so I have this straight. Two people who are NOT YOU, have a dysfunctional relationship, and YOU are affected?\n\nYou don't see anything WRONG with that?\n\nWhat? Feeling guilty that you \"friend-zoned\" him? (Men don't have \"female friends\". They just see it as \"Girl I have not had sex with, yet\". Any man who says otherwise is either gay or lying to you. Sorry to bring up such news. :P )\n\nLove isn't something you can \"just fake\", so either he never knew what love was, or he was deluded. Either way, ending your life is cowardly, and stupid.\n\nIt's not like they had meaningful communication... I'd go so far as to say he didn't even LIKE her, since he clearly knew nothing about her.\n\nHe effectively offed himself because of a stranger. I have no sympathy.\n\nYet another semi-evolved chimp who can't tell the difference between what's true and what feels good.\n\nThis was no friend. Stop wasting feelings on him.",
