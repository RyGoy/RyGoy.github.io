   "message": "I thought so too so I asked before: Lana Dukakis If we use legal tender to buy dogecoin, could the tender for law be legally attatched to the dogecoin? Sorry if that sounds stupid.\nFebruary 2 at 7:27pm � Like  Pete Daoust And HOW can you show that \"YOU\" used legal tender to get some Dogecoin with ... ?\n\nHow can you do that ??\nFebruary 2 at 7:29pm � Unlike � 4 I thought that Captain Pete meant that we were safe because there is no proof because it's all encrypted and that my ALL CAPS name wasn't EXCHANGING it. SO WE SHOULD NOT USE LEGAL TENDER TO EXCHANGE because they have jurisdiction? I thought we were being asked to use legal tender to exchange for Doge if we couldn't mine it fast enough for the 10,000 dogecoin requirement. I guess I misunderstood. I just exchanged legal tender for 20,000 dogecoins about a week ago. I guess my ALL CAPS name could get in trouble now. ?",
