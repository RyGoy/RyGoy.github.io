   "message": "I really wish I would have been WARNED and known the above before I exchanged for the coin. I was under a false impression. I need to read more and ask more questions. Wait. I did ask. I don't know, sometimes I think I understand something when I really don't. No one specifically mentioned EXCHANGING legal tender for dogecoin could find our ALL CAPS name charged with fraud and or money laundering. :(    I just read the get 10000 dogecoin and a wallet order thread again. I didn't come across anyone saying :Whatever you do do not get dogecoins using legal tender. I'm still not sure what I missed.  I didn't count but there must be over 25 people who said they were going to use legal tender and no one WARNED them that they would be committing money laundering if they did that.",
