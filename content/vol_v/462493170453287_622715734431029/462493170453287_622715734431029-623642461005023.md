   "message": "The powers that be have instituted capital controls, just try to buy anything over 10 grand with cash. The banks are questioning you like bitches when you do a withdrawal, feel like your married to the teller. Wtf ! Keep the exchanges small. Americans, Chinese and others have $50 thousand limits on leaving country. The money men want to know WHERE all their cash has gone, that's why they changed the color of it, old notes show up and people are gonna get questioned.",
