   "message": "One more time so it sinks in. About the money laundering thing again. Joe Blow spends $10,000 on prepaid credit cards, or gives the legal tender to their friend to buy $10,000 in credit cards, then those cards are gifted to Joe and he goes online to exchange that money of account for dogecoin - the cops can't do a thing and can't charge Joe with money laundering? The cops would just say \"shucks and golly\". We know Joe gave his friend legal tender, we know Joe's friend used that money to buy debit Visa cards and we know that those Visa cards were used to exchange their balance for dogecoin, BUT those super clever boys added a step and no JUSTICE would NOW ever be convinced that Joe Blow was LAUNDERING MONEY? That Joe Blow guy is too clever for us, let's close the case and call it a night. Is that right?",
