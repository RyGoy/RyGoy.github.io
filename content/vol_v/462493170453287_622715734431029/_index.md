   "message": "I've seen quite a number of articles like this one. Any comments tips or suggestions? Is there something I'm missing? Many have been charged with money laundering. It seems the police want to crack down on people who are ONLY EXCHANGING currency. How can they think that there is money laundering when they are just EXCHANGING? Do we need to worry? Do we need to exchange less than a certain amount to avoid this? The authorities seem to be fighting back. I guess they are scared that we will win.\n\n",
