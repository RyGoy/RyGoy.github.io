   "message": "Crypto currency is NOT a legal product.\nIt has no legal tender attached�\nIt is outside legal jurisdiction.\nThat is what has them trying to bust people and setting up stings. \nWhich used to be called: entrapment.\n Can you say Delorean? \nIf everything is done in a Private exchange, it is none of anyone's business.  \nThe powers that be will do anything to tell you different.\nSo, I am thinking a trust that has been established, is still advantageous when the duly authorized trustee corporation is adminstrating all exchanges in PRIVATE.\nLike your own private bank with an internal private currency. Where the legal tender is held in trust for others. Surety is held but the corporate legal person and accounted for by same. Removing the all caps name by lien takes it out of the picture, because if done properly it is PRIVATE as well.  \nThen the math takes over�",
