It's a bill of lading that secures your PERSONS in the same way Rogueupport has secured Tara and My \"PERSONS\".\nYou need the government's PERMISSION to disolve the \"bill of lading\". We only require the SHAREHOLDER'S permission...and they're WAY nicer than the government. \nIf both parties lien their names, then wouldn't that take the surety out of the equation?\nThat's \"WILFUL DAMAGE to a SECURITY INSTRUMENT\". The Marriage came first. IT has the claim, not you. Liening your name just makes you \"next in line\".\n\nHow about a DECREE that the signatures are now rescinded by free will of both parties and marriage is now and forever null and void?\nThat damages the security. The trustee you LICENSED from, will demand payment, which will, by happy coincidence, consist of everything you own.\nIf there is lien in place then our corp would be \"first in line\"? (yes?)\"",
