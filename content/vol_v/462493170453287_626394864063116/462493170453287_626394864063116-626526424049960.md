   "message": "Tommy Atherton good for you for whacking your own bush, you will find this is all verifiable. \nIt needs to be verified, if nothing shows up on the lien search then good, for me going in live, it was about being able to stand to challenges. I have faced them. I have made mistakes. I am still here.\nAll of this just made me stronger.\nSo it is good practice to verify everything for accuracy and truth.\nInteresting, that the original security agreement issued at the same time as the birth certificate, did not turn up on your on lien searches.. I had idiots at the alberta registries who, did not know what they were doing, and printed me of 50 pages of shite to find my name amongst hundreds , that all had a security agreement in placeï¿½",
