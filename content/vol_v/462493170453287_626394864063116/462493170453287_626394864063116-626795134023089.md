   "message": "I was reading this thread, and thought of this word :/\n\nConsideration\n\nSomething of value given by both parties to a contract that induces them to enter into the agreement to exchange mutual performances.\n\nConsideration is an essential element for the formation of a contract. It may consist of a promise to perform a desired act or a promise to refrain from doing an act that one is legally entitled to do. In a bilateral contract�an agreement by which both parties exchange mutual promises�each promise is regarded as sufficient consideration for the other. In a unilateral contract, an agreement by which one party makes a promise in exchange for the other's performance, the performance is consideration for the promise, while the promise is consideration for the performance.\n\nConsideration must have a value that can be objectively determined. A promise, for example, to make a gift or a promise of love or affection is not enforceable because of the subjective nature of the promise.",
