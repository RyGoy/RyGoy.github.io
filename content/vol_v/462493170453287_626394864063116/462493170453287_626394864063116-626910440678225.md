   "message": "We know the MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE is a bill of lading,  and the Bill of Lading is the MARRIAGE. Being a Bill of Lading one's trustees are going to  lien it as it moves into PRIVATE PROPERTY,  so what exactly is the proper name and/or label and/or commercial SECURITY code  of the PROPERTY  known as the bill of Lading,  Is it the red, in our case 8 digit number?  Obviously one's trustees  have to be able to identify the PROPERTY properly to lien it.",
