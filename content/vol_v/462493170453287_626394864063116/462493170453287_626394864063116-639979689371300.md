   "message": "We had a little Ethereum drinkup in Utrecht, The Netherlands where Nick, Yves and Joris did a little pair programming on a marriage contract with divorce clause: https://github.com/jorisbontje/cll-sim/blob/master/examples/i_want_half.cll\n\nWith CLL Simulation testing all the marriage scenarios :\nhttps://github.com/jorisbontje/cll-sim/blob/master/examples/i_want_half.py\n\nUsage:\n* Both parties should send their marriage proposal to the contract; with the address of other partner that they'd like to marry.\n* Once they are married, they can deposit whatever value to this shared contract.\n* To withdraw, both parties should send a transaction with the withdrawal request, recipient and amount. Once both request the same the transaction is made.\n* To divorce, both parties should send a transaction with a divorce request. Once both send the request, the remaining balance is split 50-50 among both partners... I WANT HALF! \n\nHAHAHAHA!!!!! :D",
