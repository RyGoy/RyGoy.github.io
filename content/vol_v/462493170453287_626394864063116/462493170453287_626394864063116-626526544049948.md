   "message": "So the WILLFUL DAMAGE if one's trustee were to attempt to lien the PERSONS involved in a MARRIAGE, would be caused because they are already securing another INTEREST.  So then one's trustee liens the MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE thus securing it in the private.  Once secured in the private could one's trustee  then VOID the signatures on the contract creating the MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE, thus performing a private DIVORCE?  Once done, then, could one's trustee secure the PERSON the beneficiary has in the private as well?",
