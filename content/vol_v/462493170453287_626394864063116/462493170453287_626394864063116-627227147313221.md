   "message": "So the first question from me was�.\n\nHellos, Following some research I have made, I have good reason to believe that the Government of Quebec recorded a legal privillege (lien) on the marriage certificate that we, me and my wife, have, could you confirm whether I'm right or wrong ? Thank you in advance\n\nTheir first answer: What do you mean by LIEN ( privilege legal) :-o\n\nSo, I followed by:\nHello Ms. Lamy, and thank you for your quick response ... \n\nTo be honest, I see the marriage certificate as a TRUST, and I see myself and my wife as GRANTORS concerning this trust. \n\n I see the government as Beneficiary and Trustee of the Trust, which bothers me a little�\n\nSo I wonder if the government has any POWER OF ATTORNEY and / or Lien and / or LEGAL PRIVILEGE on this marriage certificate, and / or trust. \n\nSorry for all these questions, but when we got married, we were TOTALLY ignorant about the LEGAL aspect of marriage.\n\nThanks in Advance.\n\nThen they answered: \nSeek for LEGAL advices, and we suggest to contact the Ministere of Justice :-o\n\nWHY THEY ARE SUGGESTING to contact the ministere of JUSTICE, Scott Duncan ?? :/",
