   "message": "I can say with absolute certainty that no woman on the planet has loved me more than Tara. However, no amount of love would compel her to JOINDER herself to a \"BILL OF LADING\", and hand it over to the GOVERNMENT. That means \"getting married\" (for the stupid amongst you). I'm sorry if that sounds condescending (that means talking down to people).\nNow think about this marriage transaction. The marriage INCLUDES\n\"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", not \"Scott\" OR \"Tara\". This means marriage makes you effectively ONE PERSON UNDER THE LAW. Since the marriage actually consists of THREE ENTITIES, \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", which by its nature EXCLUDES the GOVERNMENT, still remains an \"ORGANIZATION\". A marriage ORGANIZES these \"entities\" into their respective roles. If \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\" remain \"Scott AND Tara\", the GOVERNMENT HAS NO STANDING. However, if Tara sought a divorce, the MARRIED PERSON is no longer \"Scott AND Tara\", and the GOVERNMENT gets to intervene.\nThis most certainly wouldn't be the case if it was \"Scott\" OR \"Tara\". Therefore, the above CRIMINAL CODE definition of \"PERSON\" defines HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ***INSERT PROVINCE HERE***, which is both \"HER MAJESTY\" AND an \"ORGANIZATION\".",
