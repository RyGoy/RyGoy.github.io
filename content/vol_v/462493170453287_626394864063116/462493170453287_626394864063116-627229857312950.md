   "message": "Does it not make sense if the BILL is not paid for CARRYING, then any ASSETS of the GOV would be vulnerable to a lien,  Force them to collapse the TRUST of the MARRIAGE, just for starters one's trustees lien the property of the CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE, each day after the DEBT accumulates.
