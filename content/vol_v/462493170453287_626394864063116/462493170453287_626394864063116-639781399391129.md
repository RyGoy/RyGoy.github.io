   "message": "The Post nuptial agreement could be compared to a corporations charter, it is a marriage charter.  The SOLE ADMINISTRATORS for the  PERSONS IN MARRIAGE agree to appoint a corporation (say Quebec xxx inc.) as the duly authorized sole administrator.  This, new, administrator now ACCEPTS BILLS as well as directs the Trustees to carry out policy of the \"MARRIAGE CHARTER\" (POST NUP)  and gets paid for administrative duties out of the security of the MARRIAGE.   This then sets the grounds for the corp to lien.   It kind of like what we could do had the MARRIAGE not taken place, same parties, slightly different roles.",
