   "message": "all went well...still have to go back on the 9th to set the trial date.It started out in front of a JP who didn't want anything to do with me rebutting the capacity of the name so he put me over to court room 3 to speak to a judge...The judge was a sweetheart and accepted all my files and the Crown said the court appointed lawyer was un available to set a date for trial so...looks like the Crown is looking for ways to stall things! lol!",
