   "message": "I have a weird question. If say you wanted to pay off a line of credit or something. Rather than sending your payment to the bank that holds the account, would you send your payment to the Bank of Canada instead?\n\nThe reason for this question is that if chartered banks fractionalize deposits, then sending payment into the Bank of Canada would deter this from happening?
