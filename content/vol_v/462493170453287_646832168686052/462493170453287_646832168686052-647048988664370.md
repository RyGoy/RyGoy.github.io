   "message": "I asked the Justice who the man sitting next to me was,He stated it was the \"Court Appointed Lawyer\" and so I then asked for him to identify himself, he stood and stated his name and credentials. I then asked the Court how this man can effectively cross examine the Crown witness when he has no knowledge of my side and that this \"Lawyer\"has made no effort to contact me prior to the hearing.The \"Lawyer stood again and said he made efforts to contact me through mail and by phone with no success.
