   "message": "So the Justice gave us 15 min. to discuss things and when the \"Lawyer and I exited the courtroom he stopped 2 officers and asked them to keep an eye on us because he was afraid, didn't trust me and thought that I was dangerous and violent. I put several questions to him to ask the witness and he didn't ask any of the key questions that would have exposed the witness as a liar!",
