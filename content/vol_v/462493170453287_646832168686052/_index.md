   "message": "Question about lawyers.....my understanding is that they are NOT employees of the corporations they may work for....that they work more in terms of a special agreement type of situation. Is this correct?\n\nI've had one swear up and down that he is an employee, his employee status being no different to that of a customer service employee. So let's just say he was telling the truth, would the \"employee\" status mean that he would no longer be protected by limited liability?",
