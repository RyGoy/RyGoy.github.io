   "message": "In fact here it is.  I found it. Perhaps it's wrong according to what I'm learning here.  But here it is \n\nSeptember 14, 2011\nTHIS IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD\nFrom: Administrator, Beneficiary and Executor of the estate known to you, the public trustee,  as                 JASON :FRIESEN\n \nKerry Unrau, Public Servant and Public Trustee,\nThis is regarding your request to see my paystubs, tax returns and letters from employers.\nPlease be advised that I don�t have any such things and don�t get any such things.  I exchange my labor for whatever financial consideration in a private manner and it is none of your or anybody else�s business.\nFurther, I am the Administrator/Executor/Director of my corporation and estate and all associated affairs and accounts known as JASON FRIESEN (corporation according to Blacks Law Dictionary which you are well aware of)\nAre you trying to administrate my affairs?  Have you written permission from the Administrator to administer my affairs?  Are you not a trustee?  Are you not a public servant?  Do you not answer to Administrators such as myself?  Who are you to give me any orders?\nIf my X-wife hired you for help, why are you coming to me?  Why don�t you just deal with her matters and handle it like a Trustee should?\nAlso further be advised that if you wish to continue to do business with me, I have terms and conditions and a FEE Schedule.  My time has value.  \nI am the beneficiary administrator and executor, and you being a public trustee and If you call one more hearing against JASON FRIESEN without my written consent my Fee is $100,000 and I will charge it straight to your law license and I will lean it.  To follow will be an Affidavid.\n \nTo respond to any more of your tripe letters my fee is $100,000.00 per occurrences. To provide ANY information to you my fee is $100,000.00 per occurrence.  To attend court, hearing, case conference or any meeting with you of any kind, $100,000.00 will be the fee.\nMy Fee Schedule is much more comprehensive and I will not include it here at this time but be assured that any contact with you is going to cost financially to you.  Do you still wish to do business with me?\nFurthermore, about the life insurance policy that you claimed without contacting me, that I had to keep paying?  And about the so called �arrears�.  I will leave her the beneficiary in exchange for the so called back payments of child support or alimony otherwise she gets nothing since its not lawful what your demanding.\nAlso, I have it in written form from Lendra Friesen NOT LENDRA FRIESEN stating that she has agreed to the total sum of $492.00/month for child support on September 13th, 2011 at  7:17pm which is based on my current income and based on the current Manitoba Child Support table.  You can do the math based on that as to what I make at my job.  She has agreed to that and NOTHING more per month.  In other words NO arrears or any other silly fees.  Also, let it be known that I as administrator, beneficiary and executor will not be paying any court costs as this is the peoples court, not the other way around.  \nWe as adults can settle all issues outside of court.  It is Lendra�s wish and mine to settle these matters asap in a private setting.  You can be there as long as you know you are a public servant and nothing more.\nI move we sit down and settle these matters October 22nd, 2011.  You, Kerry Unrau, Lendra Friesen, Myself and another person of my choosing as witness.  Location will be at the office of Neil Friesen & Associates located on 1600 Regent Ave West at 2pm.  At this meeting we will all put to close the matter of divorce and the separation of the two corporations known as JASON FRIESEN and LENDRA FRIESEN.  There will no longer be any reason to meet after this date for any reason.  \nMake it known that it is clear I am motioning to settle this matter in a professional manner in line with the rights as the Administrator, Beneficiary and Executor and according to law, not acts and statutes which have no bearing on a man under Gods law.  \nMake it known that all monthly payments will be made through my bank account to Lendra Friesens account directly  No third party involvement since that is also not law abiding but rather a statute which has no bearing.\nRespond within 14 days to agree to terms and conditions.\nThank you\n_____________________________________________________\nADMINISTRATOR, EXECUTOR and BENEFICIARY\nJason Friesen (notice small caps letters, not CAPS which Is the corporation)",
