   "message": "Says who? Although it seems to be used as a qualifier but is it necessary? There have been many throughout history who have enjoyed a profession without having a license. It is kind of the same as legal and lawful. while one may be lawful it doesn't automatically make it legal. It is the big picture either I have wrong or you don't see. If they make the rules, they can make them say whatever they want and bend/break them as they see fit until there is someone(s) with enough POWER to stop it. Until that time comes when they have caused a revolt of the masses, they will push and push to get more and more power at ANYONES expense. AND if you are less powerful they will roll over you. If you go against the grain alone you will suffer however they see fit. If this is a stain shit forgive me and please delete or let me know so I can delete it.",
