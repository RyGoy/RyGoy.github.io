   "message": "...it would be SO EASY to use my power against ALL of you, and adopt a \"can't beat `em, so join `em\", attitude. You have no idea. I struggle with it daily.\n\n...and the cost is too high. I have to look at myself in the mirror, and look at MY life. What would I LOSE by doing that. I wouldn't be worthy of the attention of a woman like Tara, so there's a deal-breaker right there! The AVERAGE woman is just a programmed cum-recepticle pretending to be a woman like Tara, as hard as she can, and I think I will collapse the banking system, and start a war, rather than deal with that.",
