   "message": "Court - Who is Trustee?\n\nI�ve been to court more than I care to admit, back when I thought it was a good idea to �show them� what I knew. The results? How about jail time, a foreclosure (it took them 3 years to get it) and hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on ATTORNey fees. When the money would run out, I�d fire the useless cunt attorneys and take the actions over myself (another useless cunt � I know�). I�ve had some small victories yes, but when the time came to �get actual remedy� nope. They�d crush me like a grape. I was SURETY and their LEDGER needed my blood to be squared up. I remember making hour long statements in court � for what? \n\nIt got to the point where I pretty much knew everyone at the Edmonton court house. File this, motion that, application for this � stand there ARGUING my points. Why did I most always LOOSE? Because when you MAKE STATEMENTS and/or ANSWER QUESTIONS/BE DEPOSED you are in DISHONOR and the justice will most ALWAYS side with his bar brothers (who also argue). There are ways to make the justices honest and neutral, but I have yet to achieve this in open court. I have the balls to assert it, but the opportunity has not come up. I�ve managed to stay the fuck out of there � THEY DON�T CARE and I NO LONGER CARE EITHER.\n\nNext time I�m dragged into court in shackles, I will BE the notice of mistake, no need to FILE anything. That�s a promise and PUBLIC NOTICE, you can count on it. Should I go to fail, their will be repercussions. The trust holding LEGAL title to my juristic person will come forward and hold those public servants accountable. Isn't that�s what their bonds are for?\n\n\"THEY DONT FUCKING CARE\". Let's look at that for a moment. That is indeed a FACT.\n\nWhy don't they care? Humm...\n\nIs SURETY still presumed to be the fellow/TRUSTEE standing in THEIR courtroom?\n\nIsn�t it a FACT that only TRUSTEEs go to jail? \n\nWas a statement(s) made or a question answered which leads THEM to attach surety AND/OR jurisdiction to the fellow? Better think twice about that one�\n \nIt is one thing to FILE the notice of mistake; it is another thing to ENFORCE the intent behind the notice of mistake. How bad do you NOT wish to be surety?\n\nStatements = Dishonor\n\nBeing deposed = loss of Sovereignty = THEY get jurisdiction = you ARE the trustee\n\nSince when do grantors and beneficiaries of TRUSTS obey commands? Is court NOT a constructive trust and is the legal person NOT a government created trust of which YOU are the beneficiary?\n\nWhat would happen is THEY ALLOWED the fellow standing in the courtroom to NOT be surety? Who gets the bill? Is it the ATTORNey? And you THINK they are going to allow that to happen so easily?\n\nI could go on and on, but at the end of the day, do you know who you are and do you know what YOUR RIGHTS ARE? Legal persons HAVE NO RIGHTS, THAT�s WHY THEY DON�T GIVE A FUCK.\n\nSo what are you gonna do? Yell, scream and moan like a little bitch? Cower before your enemy? Get yanked out the courtroom in total dishonor like the angry slave you appear to be? \n\nOr are you gonna educate yourself and calmly ask questions designed to publicly EXPOSE what�s really going on in there? SURETY AND ACCOUNTING.\n\nWho are you gonna be and what are you gonna do?\n\nAnyway, that�s my 2 cents, take it or leave it. I certainly don't believe any of the above, it is all merely fiction jumbled in the pea sized abnormality in my head (at the moment).\n\nTomorrow, I'll make up some new bullshit for you to chew on...\n\nPEACE",
