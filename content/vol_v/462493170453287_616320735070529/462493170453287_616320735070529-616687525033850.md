   "message": "Chris, what are your options? How can THEY move forward without answering critical questions and without your consent? Let's brainstorm - in a color-able manner so as to avoid controversy...\n\nPersonally, I would inundate them with QUESTIONS structured to expose their BULLSHIT. Make it fun, it's gonna go down anyway.\n\nMr justice, can you please explain what is going on in this courtroom here today?\n\nAm I not entitled to be heard in a fair and impartial manner?\n\nWhy are you ignoring everything I have asserted respective to this action to date? Is it just me or are you actually showing favouritism towards the plaintiff? Do you have something against me, the beneficiary creditor and accommodation party for the defendant?\n\nIs it legal for you to DEEM SURETY upon a bone fide beneficiary?\n\nMr justice, what does a beneficiary and creditor such as ME have to do to be recognised as such in this court?\n\nNOTE: At this point, I�d consider addressing the peanut gallery with something like � �Does anyone in this courtroom have any fact, evidence or testimony REBUTTING the presumption that I am the Grantor AND beneficiary of the constructive trust taking place here today?� � �No?� � �Let the record show that NO ONE in this courtroom has rebutted the presumption that I am the true grantor and beneficiary of this trust and that I STAND as such�\n\nOr you could keep asking questions until they finally buckle or drag you away. Keep this in mind � How can they pin surety on YOU if you ONLY ask questions? THEY CAN�T. Sure they can ignore you and totally trample you over but when it comes down to it, THEY have violated the public trust and SOMEONE should be held accountable for that. No?\n\nMore Questions: Mr justice � is that NOT a TRUSTEE�s robe you are wearing? Then are you NOT the trustee in this action? Are you trying to delegate YOUR duty on to ME? Did you NOT swear an oath of office pledging your commitment to protect beneficiaries like me?\n\nHammer the justice with questions � Mr justice, can you please explain how you can legally DEEM me the surety in this action when I clearly DO NOT CONSENT to such a liability? What kind of court is this?\n\nIs this legal? How can this be legal and lawful? Is that NOT an act of contempt against the people, whom I consider myself a part of? What KIND of DUE PROCESS is this? \n\nSee - I told you I�d come up with more bullshit for you to chew on today. \n\n ;)\n\nPEACE",
