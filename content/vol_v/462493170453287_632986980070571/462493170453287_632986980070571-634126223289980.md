   "message": "I know I don't grasp the least bit of what Scott is saying, but even if I think wrong, I'd say it'd be more about our freedom, our collective power, which we abdicated, and by wiping out our dignity we don't even question that shit... We just roll over when asked to if we believe we can get anything in exchange, while they are living at our expense.\n\nThe whole fact that we've been programmed to always ask for permissions, that we live a life of permissions with licenses, tolerating and accepting that they rule over us and we willingly pay them to get every single bit of our rights back, we pay them to live, we pay them to act like unqualified programmed ignorant chimps who have been trained to say PLEASE, THANK YOU and to accept it... \n\nBelief makes that we tolerate nobility and religions and government etc... George Carlin told it best : Teach your children read, teach them to question what they read, to question everything, especially authority.\n\nIn fact, without our consent, they just don't get to profit from our energy and our value, which is what even restricted has lead us to where we are, and them where they are... And suddenly, I think about the exponential function... Without every single one of us, and over all those generations before us, supporting their scam acting like slaves, they just can't exist.\n\nThe first thing I told Pete when we talked about building dedicated computers for crypto's was : Man, that's creating an international army of sleeping ninja cells right there, ready to wake up all at once and fight together with enough power to do some serious damage...",
