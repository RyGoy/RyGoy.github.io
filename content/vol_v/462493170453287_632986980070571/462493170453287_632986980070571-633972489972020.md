   "message": "So Scott, if you are programing us. Then please tell me what would a human be like if not programmed? Or is such a thing possible because from MY programing tells me, we all change and adapte to our life experiences. \n\nBut without the evil entent of the Nobility or your intent to manipulate as well (with consent in both cases), what are we suppose to be like?\n\nDo you have this information?\n\nI'm just thinking about my children and doing homeschooling and all, makes me wonder if you would have a clue at the kind of education or (whatever the word may be) that would be a good path for them versus what the Nobility is getting.",
