   "message": "Hmmmmm. Maybe. Why would it lead to an emotional response? I am curious why you would say that. I have separated the two and am wondering if you are suggesting they are of the same. Questioning and emotion. I DO think that some emotions are powerful and useful at the right time, but I think I wouldn't want to make decisions about my actions just because I feel hurt, or just because I feel sad, or just because I feel horny. I am amazed at how my body CAN react without thought tho. Extremely useful tool. Maybe I am confusing reaction with emotion. Or vice versa.",
