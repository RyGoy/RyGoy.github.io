Admits you were asking for it, and now \"it's over\".\n\nNow you are upset that people think they can rape you at will, because you dress \"like a slut\"...and cry that it's your RIGHT to \"dress like a slut\", and piss and moan that you keep getting raped, and when you complain, everyone points to \"that time I asked to be raped\"...\n\nDo you see how STUPID that sounds?",
