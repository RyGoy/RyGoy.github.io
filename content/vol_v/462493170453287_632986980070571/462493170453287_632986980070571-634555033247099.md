   "message": "I'm starting to wonder, is it possible that anyone WITHOUT A PERSON actually IS NOBILITY ? Just a fuckin poor noble because the exponential function made that our parents were kept poor while the ones \"in the know\" were actually getting richer and richer ? And that's why they dont tolerate any non citizen until they actually ASK FOR citizenship (submission) / Social Insurance Number and all that shit from them ? \n\nOr is my mind spinning out of control right now ? Because I know it's spinning beyond belief !",
