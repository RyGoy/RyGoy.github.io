   "message": "I've been running in that direction for years, Scott Duncan... Only I valued even more of the wrong things then (including a girlfriend and a few friends) which were a ball and chain to me... Then I met Pete and ended up here. And I wish I had even more time to painstakingly read every single post of yours... but I'm slowly getting there... Thanks for pushing me, and all of us, in the right direction ;)\n\nAnd to the Qc'ers in here, that's why most canadians hate us... We have \"questioning authority\" in our blood... They say DNA transfers physical but also intellectual characteristics... They carry the british monarchy legacy while most of us carry genes from \"illegal\" people who were dumped here to some sort of get rid of... \n\nMy ancesters were lawmen, reporters and religious, they founded the PARTI PATRIOTE and were jailed as dissenters... The entire movement against the church crimes here in Qc, that's my family too...",
