   "message": "Adam, do you know that if you DON'T answer the simple questions posed, you will be OFFICIALLY letting everyone know I am CORRECT about my interpretation of your bullshit, and that you are LYING?\n\nSo, I will help you by repeating what I had observed you wrote (is not like is gone,  everyone can still read it, duh!) You said:\n\n1- Private debts do not exist.\n2- Public debts do not exist.\n3- All because, allegedly, money is a fiction.\n4- Reality states that if 2 + 2= a FICTION, tgen (then?) the more fictions one has, the more amount of \"Soles of Men\" \"ye have\"... ok.\n5- \"Soles\" can be apparently collected as a hobby.\n6- Satan, apparently, exists.\n7- Debts are \"in your head\".\n\nWhich of these seven points IS/ARE NOT what YOU said, if any, Adam? Very simple.",
