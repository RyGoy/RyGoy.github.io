   "message": "Scott Duncan - Menard's response to quatloos forum\nwww.facebook.com/robert.menard.52/posts/841859965829086\nRobert Menard\nRecently I posted a short discussion on the appearance of bias in court stating that the shared belief in some magical imaginary entity which had granted both the prosecutor and the judge their power was the bias itself. I addressed only one aspect of the ruling, and truthfully that was all I read, and my comments were meant to address that point and only that point. Then my attention was drawn to something SMS Mowe posted on the Quatloos forum. (They like to stalk my FB page and then discuss it and me.) Many of the posters there (like arayder) can only resort to constant personal attacks, and attempting to have any meaningful dialogue there is like trying to have a grown up discussion in a Chucky Cheese. SMS Mowes however I would be willing to converse and engage with, as they seem quite intelligent, and are usually logical and dignified in their approach. In any event reading their post brought to my attention some more passages from the previous ruling which I would like to bring to your attention and comment upon in places.",
