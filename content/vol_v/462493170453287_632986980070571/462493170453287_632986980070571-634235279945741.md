( OE thaet.png ). \n\nIn Middle English the letter Ash, �, was replaced with the letter a, so that that was spelled �at, or sometimes �et. \nThe ascender of the � was reduced (making it similar to the Old English letter Wynn, ?), which necessitated writing a small t above the letter to abbreviate the word that ( ME that.png ). \n\nIn later Middle English and Early Modern English the � evolved into a y shape, so that the word was spelled yat (although the spelling with a th replacing the � was starting to become more popular) and the abbreviation for that was a y with a small t above it ( EME that.svg ). \n\nThis abbreviation can still be seen in reprints of the 1611 edition of the King James Version of the Bible in places such as 2 Corinthians 13:7.\n\n------------------\n\nSo I guess what we should read should be:\n\nIf ONE can teach a 4 year old how to do advance calculus, which is not likely, you let me know, and I'll use MY method to teach you.\"\n\nI must be way off.... I don't know, I guess! :/",
