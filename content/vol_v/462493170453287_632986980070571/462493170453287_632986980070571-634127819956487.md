You just don't know how to articulate it.\n\nYou will discuss your shared experiences in your own ways, but you just live with them. You don't know enough to even see the problems... but you know they are there, and if you mention your concerns to Micro$oft, they will simply deny it, or call you \"mentally ill\".
