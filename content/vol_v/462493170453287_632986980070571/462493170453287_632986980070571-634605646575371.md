   "message": "Adam, this is simple. \n\nI just practically quoted you. Is my interpretation CORRECT, or am I lying? \n\nWhich of the 7 points, you believe I gave a false interpretation? \n\nWhat is it that you believe I am \"struggling with\", Adam?\n\nMaybe you know things that I don't know, and I'm missing something. So you may use this opportunity to teach the rest of the group the VALUE that you believe provide to this group. \n\nAnswer the simple questions. Logic over emotions (or bullshit), Adam Thomas. That NEVER fails.",
