   "message": "It is as simple as creating a friend = corporate person.\nHe is now your buddy, you say to him, hey would you look after this for me pleasE. He says sure, you say ok, but there are some rules = trust agreement, he says ok I will write them over here, so I remember them = corporate charter, your buddy then takes care of everything for the Slave.  The slave earns his keep as a officer of the corporation. the slave is now owned privately because you have bought him with a lien.  \nThe PUBLIC NOTICE = A BILL OF EXCHANGE, IF ANYONE VIOLATES THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE BILL OF EXCHANGE, YOU CAN SEND THEM A BILL AND EVENTUALLY BANKRUPT THE FUCKERS.  YOU ARE BANKRUPTING THE LEGAL PERSON AND SEIZING ALL OF HIS ASSETS AND LIQUIDATING THEM FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE TRUST AND THOSE IN IT.",
