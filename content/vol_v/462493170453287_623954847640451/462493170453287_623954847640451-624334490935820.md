Still recognized, no universal postal union, no United nations, No accounting to others jurisdiction, as it is a private matter. If done in proper form, in trust, in private.\nAre my thoughts on this administrative process, now.\nAs far a s clout goes, they are recognized in legal jurisdictions.\nBut as with the bill of exchange act, you will have to remind them. It is part of a much bigger club house, that I really do not want to deal with.  \nSome of my thoughts, please correct me, If I am mistaken in this, Fapster� \n:-)",
