   "message": "^^^^^^^ the dean clifford vid on trusts above, in all seriousness, explains trusts�\n It is one of the first I saw on trusts and in it 2+2=4�\nCorporations can just be bought off the shelf. no thinking needed� \nThe articles can be made to what ever the fuck you say�\nIt is a simple thing� that is hidden behind complexity and legalese in their world, in our private land, you define things and they will hold up, because it is an independent competent jurisdiction, run by a buddy.\nThat is recognized by their clubhouse, they have to respect it, or their whole system collapses�",
