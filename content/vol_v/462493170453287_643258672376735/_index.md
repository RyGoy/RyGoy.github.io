   "message": "Melbourne court rules random police checks 'not lawful'.\n\n\"Magistrate Duncan Reynolds ruled \"there is no common law power vested in police giving them the unfettered right to stop or detain a person and seek\nidentification details.\" Magistrate's ruling is consistent with DPP v Hamilton,\nSupreme Court of Victoria 2011: Justice Kaye: \"It is an ancient principle of the Common Law that a person not under arrest has no obligation to stop for police, or answer their questions. And there is no statute that removes that right.\"",
