   "message": "\"It's like Jesus himself posted on /r/catholic,\" quipped a Redditor.\n\nThe mysterious person behind the digital currency Bitcoin may still be a mystery. Dorian S. Nakamoto, the Japanese-American man in California fingered by Newsweek as the creator of Bitcoin, tells the Associated Press �he has nothing to do with it.� Though he does have a background doing financial software work according to the AP, he says he hadn�t heard of Bitcoin until 3 weeks ago, and that his comment that he was �no longer involved in that and cannot discuss it� was misunderstood. He says he was referring to classified engineering work in his past. Meanwhile, a long-dormant online account for Satoshi Nakamoto on the P2P Foundation website where Nakamoto originally discussed and posted about the Bitcoin project, came to life for the first time since 2009.\n\n�I am not Dorian Nakamoto,� Satoshi Nakamoto added as a reply on a February 11, 2009 post announcing Bitcoin.\n\nI am not dorian nakamoto p2p\n\n�It�s like Jesus himself posted on [Catholicism discussion board],� commented a Redditor.\n\n�Then again�isn�t that what Dorian Nakamoto WOULD say (if he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto)?� tweeted David Chen.\n\nA representative from the P2P Foundation says on Reddit that the site is attempting to verify the post and plans to issue a statement.\n\nWhile there�s now new doubt about whether Dorian Nakamoto is in fact Satoshi Nakamoto, I stand by my argument of this morning that whoever Bitcoin�s creator is, revealing his (or her) true identity is a necessary and important act of journalism. In the meantime, today�s back and forth on this story � including a L.A. car chase � has been as much of a rollercoaster, as one Redditor notes, as investing in Bitcoin.\n\nSource: extracted/ forbes.com",
