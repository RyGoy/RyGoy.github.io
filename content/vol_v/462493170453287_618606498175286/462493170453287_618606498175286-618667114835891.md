   "message": "That's a Cop fishing.\n\nDerek actually thinks that idiot is going to show him a \"magic clubhouse rule\" that will fix everything.\n\nCory \"pants-on-fire\" Black (when he wasn't calling me names) kept citing clubhouse rules and that JOINDER is ok, because (presumably) the \"magic\" clubhouse rule will suddenly make them obey their own laws.\n\nWhen we've finished our bank we are going to buy him big fat legal books FILLED with clubhouse rules... purchased with money we conjure into existence.\n\nHe gets ALL the Clubhouse rules he can whack off to, and all of YOU get Genuine Rock-and-roll CA$Hish! You won't have FREEDOM but you WILL loosen the chains.\n\nEverybody wins.\n\nBut that is coming? Pete Daoust is leading the charge. Follow his example. Follow my instructions. It really is that simple.\n\nWARNING: Once this little initiative starts producing, all the Derek Morans of the world are going to come running back here trying to get you to \"catch them up\" on what they missed. Tell them the Admiral said NO. Then buy them a book of clubhouse rules. They made their choice.\n\nNOTHING I show you is hidden. Let them figure it out on their own. I want a living wage to be your reward for NOT being an idiot.",
