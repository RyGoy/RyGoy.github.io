   "message": "Ok still learning myself...and to an extent it is on the private side since you have a duly authorized trustee corporation dealing with affairs of the name....I'm thinking you bill them ....when they don't respond in a certain amount of days...then you send them an opportunity to cure....then an affidavit of obligation...then you lien and post publically.....\n\nI'm thinking who ever has signed throughout this whole process would be on your list for this?\n\nWhat im not clear on is whether you would need to go through an admin process to get a default against each of the players before you bill them. My thoughts are you need to let them know that it is trust law now...you also may want to if you havent already in your notice recognize that the corp will be dealing with ALL in relation to the name both past outstanding issues and or alll any future ones\n\nI'm not positive on this maybe some others could chime in..in case im totally out to lunch",
