   "message": "Eamonn, there are MANY people in this country who make their living off of welfare. These people do not think about what happens behind the scenes. They see this as \" I will get another exemption on my taxes and receive other benefits and have NO expenses for this person.\" And as far as government is concerned, they are going to overlook it until the benefit no longer applies to the government.",
