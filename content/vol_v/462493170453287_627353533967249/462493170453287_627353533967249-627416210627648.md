   "message": "That question is curious in that it makes certain odd assumptions.  First, if I understand the question, that being soft and furry is a preferable state to being honest and authentic.

The third is the presumption that if any of these things were true, I would have previously withheld the information, but would willingly disclose it if asked.  Scott was, and is, an awesome guy.  I wouldn't change a thing.",
