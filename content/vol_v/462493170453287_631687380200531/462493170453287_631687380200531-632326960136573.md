   "message": "In my updated letter I allow them to keep the interest accumulated on this principal as an \"administration\" fee. I even considered adding a one time additional sum and was considering adding a addendum that specifies that my offer to allow them to keep interest (or sum) is void if I have to lien them after 30 days. What do you think about putting that in the l;etter... the possibility of commercial lien if not resolved in 30 days with a  bank draft?",
