   "message": "In my 2 yrs of learning, I've never actually seen a deed for a property... Below is the deed to my mother's house... The town council are the freehold owners while a government issued person that my mother controlled at the time is the LEASEhold owner...\n\nI dealt with a probate officer yesterday and she said that the holding position can be changed from leasehold to freehold as the property has no mortgage...\n\nMy question is, if a freehold was applied for, would it be registered in a new government issued person's id? My educated guess is yes... It's all commerce, and one needs a person to engage in it... \n\nIf a freehold was to be obtained could it be registered with a taken name? \n\nApplication : FREEHOLD \nName and surname : FUCK YOU\n                               THAT'S WHY\n\n:P",
