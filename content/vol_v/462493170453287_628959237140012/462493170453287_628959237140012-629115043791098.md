   "message": "Chip Douglas : It seems obvious since the registrar created/signed the Birth Certificate, but I asked that question too. I also asked them, regarding a stamp they put on the Live Birth Record which mentions a LOT # and a COLLECTOR # : What is due to me ? How much of it ? Where is it ? How can I get it ? I wish to claim it !\n\nThey also told me they cannot give legal advice and I should contact a lawyer with any question regarding legal stuff. I said there doesn't seem to be a dispute and they certainly will not force me to contract a lawyer (I did challenge a few lawyers, some of them are friends of mine, and somehow they now wanna avoid discussing stuff with me :( ), I deserve answers because THEY created all that shit OVER MY BACK WITHOUT MY CONSENT so as a (unwilling) party to that contract they must disclose the info. At which point they stopped replying, so I sent them a default notice last week, and an affidavit stating a few facts I can prove...\n\nShould have seen the face of the notary when I presented her the whole paperwork and had to explain everything to her... Like she realized everything she knew was wrong !???",
