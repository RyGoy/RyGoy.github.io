   "message": "The document stated \"we wish to have the account settled. We hereby demand you send us a BILL for the balance owing for the PERSONS' ACCOUNT. We promise to administrate all debts attached to any BILLS we receive from you.\"  I will refrain from  using the word \"settled\" in subsequent documents.
