   "message": "Well, its a response to Eamonn O Brien's comment, he said that if I walk in a bank to settle a loan with just cash, they will turn it into money of account, a check, that they will give back to ME, thinking I'm surety, because I need to SIGN it. When in the CASH, my PERSON is NOT surety for those bills. You get it now?\n\nHow can a bank force my PERSON to turn cash into money of account? I don't see guns there.",
