   "message": "Thanks Pete, I will ask  if he (signatory party)  could help us complete the Bill he sent.  I agree about the use of the \"paying\" word, that is his words, I wrote them explaining that we are wishing to administrate a Bill for the account if we are provided with one.  With your knowledge of what qualifies a Bill of Exchange, would you consider the posted document a Bill of Exchange?  We received a \"statement\" along with the posted document, and his language clearly, again, is an offer for us to be surety.  I will, again, correct our intent with a wish for us to receive instruction on how to properly complete the Bill.",
