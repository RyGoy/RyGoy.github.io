   "message": "You're still missing the point. You all claim to want to \"stop being sheep\", and break out of your social programming, but then you go and transfer the same twisted ideals of the world you want so desperately to escape into here. \n\nCase in point: \"he was a special, no child left behind!\".\n\nYou may think that was humorous, David, but that too simply shows your complete lack of understanding of ANYTHING that has been said in this thread. You say you want to be free, but you're still happily running on your little hamster wheel. \n\nYou want to be free? Then start paying attention and CHANGE the way you think!\n\nPersonally, I don't know that any of you really want \"freedom\"...you're just looking for a better set of masters.",
