   "message": "Do what you want David Johansen, it's your life...if you attach value to what Adam Thomas offers re posts he makes or the Buck-o-five process and wish to compensate him for it somehow, then that is your decision to make.\n\nTara made an interesting point, that everyone in here shares interesting & at times valuable information...why reward one & not others?  \n\nShe also noted that the order re acquiring and funding a dogecoin wallet occurred while Adam was not in the group.\n\nNow, if any new member joined today, what would be the purpose of obliging each of us to fund a dogecoin wallet for this new member, whoever they may  be, especially if they have not contributed to the knowledge base or learning process?\n\nThat is the principle of rewarding an absence of value or lack of value.  That is what happens in the school system when every kid gets a pass mark...it doesn't raise standards but rewards substandard behaviour.\n\nThat is a big part of what we wish to address in government, lifelong rewards for substandard performance, or at the very least step outside of that system.  Tara just pointed out that hypocrisy, that I was also a party to.\n\nIF, there was a coherent, well referenced, explanation of the clubhouse or other rules as to why & how the buck o five works, that process would have value to me, because it provides a source of remedy.  I would be willing to reward that.  However, I haven't found it and if someone/anyone can fast track that learning, then the same offer stands.\n\nHowever, I'm leaning toward the attitude that they don't give a shit anymore about their own rules, so the only remedy is not to play, to stop being an enabler and/or be a small part of collapsing the system as it currently stands.\n\nThe fact that the Admiral supplies so much information freely (regardless as to whether it serves his agenda or not), also has value to me.  If/as/when the time comes that he wishes to make use of some value that I may be able to offer, it will be a fair exchange as far as I can tell.\n\nAfter all, if we're already programmed, I'd appreciate a set of corrective lenses so that I may see a little farther & more clearly.\n\nIf I've missed the point, I apologise.",
