   "message": "Killing people is OK, and I never had much of a problem with it (It's not like there's a shortage), but it's a young man/woman's game. I know LOTS of people who would actually enjoy it.\n\nMy father deserves at least that. I'll kill him myself if it comes down to it, but my heart really isn't in it. It should be done by someone passionate about their work.",
