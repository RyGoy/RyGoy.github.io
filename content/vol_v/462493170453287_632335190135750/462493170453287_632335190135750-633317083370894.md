   "message": "I'm not sure what your point is, David Johansen.  It might be a compliment, a dressing-down, or high irony.  No matter.  I like Pete Daoust, and I think he's smarter than almost everyone here.  \n\nI sometimes point out things I observe when I think they might be counter-productive.  People are free to make what they wish of the observations.\n\nI don't think anyone here has ever seen me \"take someone apart\".  If that was what you made of the comment, however, it might be best not to reference me in conversations.",
