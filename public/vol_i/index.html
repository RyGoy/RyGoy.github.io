    some funny Bank of Canada hypocrisy: &#34;The fact that bank notes are legal tender does not mean that there is a legal obligation to accept them. This does not force anyone to accept cash because both parties must agree on the payment method.&#34;  

Umm, okay - works for me..how&#39;bout i just sign you a &#39;Consumer Purchase&#39; then.....um, but you have to present to me the Bill first  :/

    So a friend-of-a-friend, SOMEHOW, through his knowledge with the magical-use of EFTs(Electronic Fund Transfers), manages to discharge the rest of his mortgage with it - and, more importantly..one of the major Banks he was dealing with, under their own free will, went along with it and discharges the mortgage for him. Great, right? Wrong. Three months later the Bank is back, basically saying- &#34;We changed our mind.. you have to re-pay us $260,000.. you&#39;ve got til February 28th to vacate the premises...&#34;  I can only think of 5 words: KOO-KOO, FOR-COCOA-PUFFS

    The court offers you the right to claim sovereignty IN THEIR JURISDICTION, WITH FULL SOVEREIGN STATUS all the time. There&#39;s a catch; you MUST wait for them to offer it.

YOU don&#39;t know what the word &#34;belligerent&#34; means, do you?

When a court says you are a &#34;belligerent defendant&#34; (That&#39;s a NOUN; for the retarded people who THOUGHT they knew what it meant), what are they saying?

    THE TENDER FOR LAW is an examination of what you need to know to fight Judicial corruption, by examining the stuff you are LIED TO about.

This forum is where you can ask all your questions, and we don&#39;t have to keep typing the same answers over and over.

Post your question, we will do our best to answer. OFF TOPIC POSTS WILL BE PURGED. We want people to be able to use this as a central reference and a place to go for help, where people will take the time to do so.

Post any questions on LAW, MONEY, CONTRACTS, and JURISDICTIONS and how they are connected.

Keep it civil, even if Scott doesn&#39;t. (It&#39;s Scott after all. Seriously, it&#39;s better than paying him) Remember that Scott chooses his words carefully. LEARN WHAT THOSE WORDS MEAN.

    YOU ARE THE &#34;NATION&#34;

It is always a temptation to an armed and agile nation
  To call upon a neighbour and to say: --
&#34;We invaded you last night--we are quite prepared to fight,
  Unless you pay us cash to go away.&#34;

And that is called asking for Dane-geld,
  And the people who ask it explain
That you&#39;ve only to pay &#39;em the Dane-geld
  And then  you&#39;ll get rid of the Dane!

It is always a temptation for a rich and lazy nation,
  To puff and look important and to say: --
&#34;Though we know we should defeat you, we have not the time to meet you.
  We will therefore pay you cash to go away.&#34;

And that is called paying the Dane-geld;
  But we&#39;ve  proved it again and  again,
That if once you have paid him the Dane-geld
  You never get rid of the Dane.

It is wrong to put temptation in the path of any nation,
  For fear they should succumb and go astray;
So when you are requested to pay up or be molested,
  You will find it better policy to say: --

&#34;We never pay any-one Dane-geld,
  No matter how trifling the cost;
For the end of that game is oppression and shame,
  And the nation that pays it is lost!&#34;

NEVER PAY THE DANE-GELD!

    THE TENDER FOR LAW � LIVE EXAMPLE #001 � PROPER NOTICE FOR IDIOTS (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License. 

TONIGHT&#39;S TOPIC: PROPER NOTICE

In one of the many ongoing AQUILAE initiatives, I have cause to produce a NOTICE.

Since I&#39;m using THE TENDER FOR LAW as a notebook for my students, I figure I might as well �kill two birds with one stone� by discussing the aspects of NOTICE here, more specifically PROPER NOTICE.

As a secondary objective we shall learn the difference between a GIFT and a COURTESY.

*spoiler alert* - Courtesy doesn&#39;t mean what you think it means, because like money a COURTESY is, in fact, a...

...TENDER FOR LAW!

As long as there have been professions, there have been LAWs governing them; and a courtesy is one of the oldest tenders for LAW, because it governs the oldest profession.  You see, my friends, COURTESIES are for COURTESANS, because THEY&#39;RE THE ONES GETTING FUCKED.  If you ACCEPT a COURTESY, you accept that you&#39;re the one getting fucked.  I can&#39;t put it any simpler.  This is why you NEVER accept courtesies from the government.  

The GOVERNMENT is not a PERSON.

The COURT is not a PERSON.

...and if you accept a courtesy from the court, you are putting it on the PUBLIC RECORD that in ALL LEGAL EXCHANGES, YOU&#39;RE THE ONE GETTING FUCKED!

A GIFT, on the other hand...

... is exactly what you think it means. :/

Digressing from the spoiler alert (because when I �spoil� it&#39;s hard core), and returning to the NOTICE, I shall now discuss the practical aspects of PROPER NOTICE.  We&#39;ll start with one of the simplest notices:

KEEP OFF THE GRASS. 

Is this PROPER NOTICE?  

Yes it is, however the LEGAL strength of this notice is dependent on WHERE THE NOTICE IS.  The terms of the notice, �KEEP OFF THE GRASS�, is far different for a PUBLIC PARK than say, for example... A HOUSE FULL OF RUSSIAN MOBSTERS.  Ignoring the NOTICE has DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES depending on WHERE IT IS.  If you are going to wield LAW, your NUMBER ONE GOAL SHOULD BE TO REMOVE VARIABLES, and I have just described a big one!  

How do you remove this variable?

Let&#39;s look at another PUBLIC NOTICE that all of us have seen.

NO PARKING

On the surface, �NO PARKING� and �KEEP OFF THE GRASS� are functionally the same, however, unlike �KEEP OFF THE GRASS�, a �NO PARKING� sign will also give you notice as to WHO PUT IT THERE.  This removes the variables that �KEEP OFF THE GRASS� has.

We have removed the question as to WHO is saying this, and as a byproduct, the consequences of ignoring the notice. As I&#39;ve mentioned throughout the TENDER FOR LAW, the question �WHO are you?� puts the court in the most jeopardy.  Identifying WHO you are when giving a notice creates what&#39;s called �PROPER NOTICE�.  The primary goal of a LEGAL document is to remove all possible variables to accomplish its goal.  �NO PARKING� is pretty specific.  It reduces the variables to �PARKED�, and �NOT PARKED�.  �NOT PARKED� is the GOAL of the notice.  �PARKED� is something to be discouraged.  

If it is a TRUST and not a PERSON WHO posts the NOTICE, it is what is known as a BY-LAW.  This means that should you choose (of your own free will) to interact with the TRUST, you are subject to the BY-LAWS.  TRUST LAW is the HIGHEST LAW.  It trumps ADMIRALTY LAW.  It trumps CANON LAW.  It is the HIGHEST LAW.

Thus endeth the preamble.  Let&#39;s draw us up a NOTICE.

In this particular case a VESSEL has been LAWFULLY transferred to the AQUILAE TRUST.

As this VESSEL is NOT in AQUILAE&#39;s custody, a PUBLIC NOTICE must be given laying CLAIM to the VESSEL.  This permanently curtails any SALVAGE RIGHTS on said VESSEL.  If you construct a VESSEL it is VERILY YOUR RIGHT to transfer ownership of said VESSEL, but one must remember, one does not own the SOUL of the VESSEL, and should the SOUL speak, their word is LAW.  If you want to find this LAW, you have only to look in the CAPTAIN&#39;s Log; for the CAPTAIN is the SOUL in question.

Now like every other LEGAL document, the first line on the LEGAL document MUST state what the document is.

CERTIFICATES, BONDS and NOTES are often mistakenly called LEGAL DOCUMENTS, when their actual LEGAL status is, �VALUABLE INSTRUMENT�.  It&#39;s not �LEGAL INSTRUMENT� because �LEGAL� does not indicate VALUE.  The name itself, says what it is; an INSTRUMENT you can attach VALUE to.  But we&#39;re not dealing with �VALUABLE INSTRUMENTS�, because we are transferring this VESSEL from the LOWEST LAW (ADMIRALTY) to the HIGHEST LAW (TRUST).  This pulls it out of the ADMIRALTY JURISDICTION.  

I&#39;m sure some of you are putting this together already, so I&#39;ll just give away the ending, because I&#39;m a total dick that way.

In ADMIRALTY, on land, you are considered a �VESSEL� in dry dock.  You&#39;re not a corporation, you&#39;re a boat in the eyes of ADMIRALTY LAW.  You are a VESSEL �ON-THE-HARD� in marine slang.  If you are ever in a marina you will notice that the marina leaves everybody who is docked, alone.  They won&#39;t speak to the CAPTAINS unless spoken to, and the CAPTAINS are given the utmost respect...

...until they pull your boat out of the water.  

When the VESSEL is �ON-THE-HARD� you are now in the marina&#39;s �CUSTODY�, and your STATUS is very, very, different; and this, above all, is why you treat the HARBOUR MASTER with the highest respect.  My experience has shown that doing this ALWAYS pays off...

...but I digress.

Let&#39;s construct the first line of our document.

The first line of the document MUST state WHAT IT IS.  

Since this is intended to be a PUBLIC NOTICE, it makes sense that �PUBLIC NOTICE� be the first line.  There is now no confusion as to what this document IS, and WHO it is .  It is not addressing a particular INDIVIDUAL.  This means if you give a PUBLIC NOTICE to an INDIVIDUAL, you are DEEMED to have done so as a COURTESY.  You&#39;ve already read the spoiler so I&#39;m not building the plot up.  

As a courtesy, a copy of this PUBLIC NOTICE (with some redacted shit filled in) will be sent by registered mail to a LAWYER who mistakenly BELIEVES he/she/it has INTEREST in the VESSEL.  As an extra COURTESY, a copy of the LIEN on the VESSEL will be included, because we at AQUILAE, if nothing else, are very, very, COURTEOUS.  ;)

The next line in any LEGAL DOCUMENT must list any PARTIES being referred to.  Since this is a PUBLIC NOTICE there are no PARTIES to list.  Therefore PUBLIC NOTICE meets all LEGAL obligation.    

After this point in the document, all UNDERTAKINGS must be listed.  

So if I posted a PUBLIC NOTICE, I am, in fact, POSTING A BILL.  A BILL is also a TENDER FOR LAW.  When you receive a BILL for your meal, your ACCEPTANCE makes it LAW.

When you give an ORDER, you have pre-accepted the LAW, and the BILL is simply a FORMality (Everybody GET THAT?).  

A BILL in PARLIAMENT is supposedly ordered by the CITIZENS, or �DEEMED ORDERED� by the CITIZENS.  This is why the phrase, �POST NO BILLS�, is often found on temporary structures with flat surfaces.  �POST NO BILLS� = �POST NO TENDERS FOR LAW�; This means you have been PROPERLY NOTIFIED (PROPER NOTICE because a BILL is a TENDER FOR LAW).

THERE ARE NO HOMONYMS IN LAW

THERE ARE NO SYNONYMS IN LAW

For instance, BILL C1,1985 is a BILL nobody accepted, simply because there&#39;s no sane person that would accept, THE INCOME TAX ACT.  

This act has been AMENDED MANY, MANY TIMES, but has never been ACCEPTED into LAW, and like the deluded Christians you&#39;ll find on Dean&#39;s Facebook page, the GOVERNMENT will pretend not to know this, and will IGNORE/ATTACK those who point it out or give PROPER NOTICE.

This is one of the dirtiest �hidden-in-plain-sight� secrets in LAW.  The Income Tax Act that was once LAW, for the purpose of paying for the war, expired DECADES AGO, and people just kept paying.  

They govern these PAYMENTS OF IGNORANCE through an OUTSOURCED THIRD-PARTY.  Douglas Levitt didn&#39;t come into my home with a gun. Cowards don&#39;t do that, and ALL LAWYERS ARE COWARDS.  These are strangers who harm people for money. Only cowards choose such a profession. If they wish to inflict violence, they outsource to a third-party, and pay them...

Where was I? OH YES! I remember...

THEREFORE having received PROPER NOTICE (PROPER NOTICE = KNOWLEDGE under LAW), you now KNOW that, should you POST a TENDER FOR LAW, it is NOT REASONABLE TO BELIEVE your TENDER FOR LAW will be there at a LATER TIME.  

However in our case, we are going to POST our PUBLIC NOTICE by way of the POSTAL SERVICE.  :D

The POSTal SERVICE (Everybody GET THAT?) 

The POSTAL SERVICE is a service provided for POSTING TENDERS FOR LAW.  So when you send a REGISTERED letter via the POSTAL SERVICE, this service also BEARS WITNESS (and gives a RECEIPT for it) to the fact that NOTICE was posted to a specific PARTY.   

Now; In the interest of time, I shall now draw out that PUBLIC NOTICE, because the PARTY I&#39;m drafting the document for, is wondering why I&#39;m not on the phone with him right now, drafting it with him. :/

Drafting documents in public is a lot like fucking in public.  Many parties will consider it in  bad taste, some might even find it disgusting, but in the end it rarely happens, and it&#39;s fun to watch.

What?  Am I wrong?

So let&#39;s draft this document RIGHT NOW. :D

***BEGIN***

PUBLIC NOTICE

TAKE NOTICE that the VESSEL known as ***redacted shit here*** is now the LAWFUL PROPERTY of the AQUILAE TRUST per the wishes  of  ***redacted shit here***&#39;S CREATOR and GRANTOR.  

Therefore: LET IT BE KNOWN THAT AS OF THIS DATE, BEING FEBRUARY 18, 2013, THE VESSEL KNOWN AS ***redacted shit here*** MUST BE CONSIDERED A PRIVATE VESSEL WITH NO  COMMERCE EXPECTED AND/OR IMPLIED.

AQUILAE TRUST SEAL (Insert lower right)

***END***

And there&#39;s everything you need for A NOTICE.

Viewing women who are �lubed up� by this awesomeness are, of course, invited to drop by for a ride.  Extra points if you show up in a �Naughty Schoolgirl� outfit.

HOW BANKS CREATE, AND WOULD LIKE TO CREATE, MORE CREDIT THEY STEAL FROM YOU

INDUSTRY COMMENTS: Section 1.9, Asset to capital multiple
Would OSFI please consider a recalibration of the 20x and 23x maximum assets to capital multiple (ACM). The change in the definition of capital will increase banks� ACM without a corresponding increase in risk taking. Higher maximum ACM would allow banks to absorb the change to the definition of capital (i.e. which will put Canadian banks at a disadvantage as we phase in new capital deductions), and put banks in a better position to deal with the complications arising from managing the phase-out of existing Tier 2 capital (i.e. subordinated debentures), while planning for the ultimate transition to the new Tier 1-based Basel III Leverage Ratio.

OSFI RESPONSE: OSFI does not feel it would be prudent to increase the maximum authorized Assets to Capital Multiple at this time given the Basel III leverage ratio is still under review and as we move towards public disclosure of the leverage ratio in 2015 and implementation in 2018,

    THIS, is a TENDER FOR LAW.

Let&#39;s look at the LEGAL aspects of this. (Legal=Commerce)
Commerce. You sell TRUST, for FIAT CURRENCY? REALLY?

This is where the term &#34;sold out&#34; came from. The 13 Colonies spawned the term. EVERYONE knew who they were and they understood Jurisdiction. It&#39;s why they left the Banker&#39;s dominion called &#34;Europe&#34; behind.

TRUST LAW IS THE HIGHEST LAW

DON&#39;T SELL ITS VALUE TO LOWER LAW!

    - Property registered to the PERSON -

   I would think that once the property isn&#39;t used to cause harm then any interaction between THEM and the PERSON in relation to the property is just an attempt to engage a man/woman as surety for their benefit yes?

i.e. - My car is registered to the PERSON. They own their PERSON but I have control of it. Any contact from them after registration is an offer from them for me to act as trustee and take liability for alleged debts?

    I SMELL A RAT.

I&#39;ve been saying this for a while, but the rat&#39;s getting smellier and I must elaborate.  

I&#39;m currently reading through a transcript of the case management hearing that Jeff was trying to attend on February 15, 2013.  There is somebody they purport to be �MR. CLIFFORD� , and as I read these TRANSCRIPTS I realize that this is not Dean.  There is somebody �acting as Dean�.  Dean does not talk like this.  I know Dean.  He does not trip over his words.

The Dean I know is very precise in his speech and concise in his phrasing.  That said, the PUBLIC RECORD is replete with Dean Clifford �quotations�.  He appears to be �RESPONDING� to the �TITLE�, �MR. CLIFFORD� while simultaneously denying his status as �MR. CLIFFORD�.

The words and phrasing that he is using have an air of familiarity to them, like I&#39;ve read them before...like, you know, in other court transcripts.  

They took $60.00 from Martin, but did not deliver him a signed copy.  Even though they charged him a bargain price, he still bought an AUTHENTICATED DOCUMENT.  Martin is aware of the contents now, but he most certainly did not receive what he purchased.  

Anybody who has followed my adventures getting transcripts knows beyond any doubt that this is not the way a COURT REPORTER&#39;S OFFICE works in real life.  

WHY did they produce this so fast, and WHY does it so conveniently have Dean answering to �MR CLIFFORD�, when questions are asked?...

Seriously?  Does anybody buy that?

Dean is an AQUILAE TRUSTEE.  HE UNDERSTANDS OATHS, FEALTY AND SURETY.  In sort, Dean knows better.  He actually has a clue, and he has experience.

All of you are a bunch of morons who can&#39;t tell their asses from a hole-in-the-ground, and YOU know better!  

They&#39;re trying to convince me that Dean has BREACHED THE TRUST.  I can either RESPOND TO THEM, now that I have KNOWLEDGE of this �TRANSCRIPT� or...

I can take the high road, and let you read through it; and you tell me if you think you are hearing Dean, or if this is just cut-and-paste from other hearings.  Special bonus points for those who can tell me why this is most definitely NOT a COURT TRANSCRIPT!

    ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD (OPPF)

You&#39;ll notice I didn&#39;t use the word TRUST.

Scams like this diminish the word in much the same way GOVERNMENTS have diminished the words �human rights�.  As this is my forum, I think I will prevent the concept of TRUSTS being diminished any further by this scam. 

So OPPF it is.

Before I get started about this, I&#39;m going to raise another TRUST system.  It should have died at the outset because one guy ends up with the money.  I&#39;m talking about bitcoin, except you can TRUST and VERIFY bitcoin.  It is a mathematical process that requires no trust.  You don&#39;t need to trust bitcoin any more than you need to trust 2 &#43; 2 = 4; and that&#39;s why bitcoin is a perfectly viable currency until the guy who started it gets all the money.

It is an automated-accounting, self-regulated currency.  Bitcoin is the by-product of our knowledge of fundamental universal truths regarding numbers.  For math is a pure discipline.  There&#39;s nothing more to learn about it, and trillions of undiscovered things you can do with what we know.

I see a beauty and elegance, and even humour for those who can read the math in bitcoin.  And that&#39;s why you can TRUST, because you get to VERIFY.

Now let&#39;s look at the ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD. 

Those that can&#39;t be bothered clogging up valuable intellect with bullshit, can reduce OPPF to its base components...and it basically goes like this...

Three guys �reclaim� the world&#39;s wealth by way of the UCC, backed by the people in the TRUST.  Except in every context with the UCC SERVICING NOTICE, etc., they are all LEGAL CLAIMS.  The mere fact that you are GIVING NOTICE acknowledges the process.  A TRUST cannot make aggressive moves like SERVING NOTICE and MAKING A CLAIM.  A TRUST has AUTHORITY over what it RECEIVES.  TRUSTS exist to fulfill a purpose based on ASSETS it has RECEIVED.  

A TRUST IS NOT A PERSON UNDER LAW.  

A TRUST IS NOT A PARTY UNDER LAW.

And a TRUST can only RECEIVE.

The AQUILAE TRUST, for example, has a PRIMARY MANDATE to restore EXECUTIVE POWER to The House of Windsor.  This is a relatively unattainable goal.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll see Queen Elizabeth II saying, �Off with his head� in my lifetime, but that is, in fact, its PRIMARY MANDATE.  

As it is a PRIVATE TRUST (PRIVATEER) we stand by to SERVE The House of Windsor.  The House of Windsor can give AQUILAE an ORDER, and can TRUST that the ORDERS will be followed, even though The House of Windsor has no LEGAL or LAWFUL AUTHORITY over AQUILAE.

Every TRUSTEE is aware of this, and if &#39;Liz says, �Suit up and go to war�, we �Suit up and go to war�, because we said we would and she can TRUST us to do so.

PROMISARY NOTES have the CREDIT and WORTH of those making the promises.  ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD are making promises they cannot LEGALLY AND/OR LAWFULLY keep.  

It is therefore reasonable to presume, based on the preponderance of EVIDENCE, that the ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD exists SOLEY for the purpose of profiting from your credulity.

You have often heard me speak ill of Robert Menard, but I want you to pay close attention to what I speak.  Robert Menard tells the absolute TRUTH about the law.  In fact, I dare say you can almost (but not quite) TRUST what he says about law.  If it&#39;s the TRUTH it doesn&#39;t matter who says it.  2 &#43; 2 = 4.  It doesn&#39;t matter if I say it, or if Robert Menard says it, or if Charles Manson says it...2 &#43; 2 will still equal 4. 

However, Robert Menard lies through omission.  If you ever want to see Robert Menard fumble around, and ask bullshit-deflecting questions, just ask him what �THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER� means.  

ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD is FRAUD at the outset.  Always remember the noble lie.  If it requires BELIEF in anything, spirits, gods, fairies, etc., you are being sold FRAUD.  There are no exceptions to this rule.

From childhood you are sold the lie that faith and trust are equal, and they reinforce it with other lies like, �You must respect the beliefs of others.�  Think about that for a second.  Why must I respect the beliefs of others?  Why have belief at all?  If you examine the concept, belief is an end.  It means you don&#39;t have to go looking any further.  It means you can �just assume�, never having once examine WHY it should be believed.

Observe the threads in this very forum.  My mere public position that �your ignorance does not equal my knowledge� immediately gets a million ad hominem attacks.  I collect the names you call me like trophies, and all of you that call me these things remind me that none of you are capable of having original thought.

All because I have offended your �beliefs�.  

And you enter with the arrogant position that if I don&#39;t believe what you do, there must be something wrong with me, which reveals your hypocrisy.  You see, in order for you to have the opportunity to say these things about me, you most certainly would have had to initiate the communication; because the only reason you would talk to me is because you want my knowledge.  

I would not talk to you.  Your very beliefs negate the possibility of UNDERSTANDING.  You have nothing of VALUE for me, and presenting an �alternate view� which focuses on bullshit always seems to neglect to mention the fact that it is, in fact, focused on bullshit. 

In short, belief has no VALUE.  Those who say it does are selling you FRAUD, and you must always suspect the motives of those selling demonstrable FRAUD as TRUST.

The most primitive example of the self-imposed ignorance of belief can be found in Roman Numerals; and before I start with this I just want to remind everyone that the Ancient Greeks calculated the circumference of the earth, so the concept of zero was well-known throughout history.  If you BELIEVE otherwise, examine the source of that belief and you will discover it is, in fact, bullshit.

The number zero represents fifty percent of all math in existence.  If you do not understand that statement, and do not understand why that is, you are not qualified to speak of math.  I digress...

I think of my own personal knowledge of computer science, and the vast technological powers I wield simply because �nobody else knows how to do it.�  I cringe in empathetic fear for humanity when I look upon its nine billion souls, all in some way, intimately tied to science and technology, and knowing nothing about science and technology.  Even the most simple-minded amongst you cannot be so stupid that they cannot see this situation is a recipe for disaster.

And every day, I&#39;ll hear some ignorant, credulous adult, with an imaginary friend, declare that I am ignorant, and that I am �closed-minded�, of course; and this is my personal favorite, that I&#39;m �mentally ill� or some sub-category therein. 

These people truly believe that their ignorance is wisdom, and that their belief equals my knowledge; and that is precisely why I DO NOT RESPECT THE BELIEFS OF OTHERS.

Let&#39;s jump back in time to the Romans.  The Romans had a technologically-evolving society.  Mathematics and computer science were actually in heavy use, and numeric policy and process allowed those that could conceptualize the math to engineer aqueducts that are working to this day.  

Computer Science is profoundly powerful knowledge.  I have the ability to literally speak to the universe, and it will speak back � in numbers.  The test for intelligence is the test of understanding prime numbers, for these things are universal, and all of it requires not one scrap of belief.

Those who don&#39;t see that only prove my point, because it&#39;s as true as 2 &#43; 2 = 4...

...and I&#39;ll demonstrate with the Romans.

Bookkeeping&#39;s a boring job, isn&#39;t it?  Those who have been saddled with such a task will know what I&#39;m describing when I speak of numbers dancing in your head, and you, being a pattern-seeking mammal, indulge yourself in the boredom   by seeing how you make these numbers dance in a pattern you have not yet seen.

This is actually a very profound process and a lot of people miss it.  The last thing the Romans wanted were smart bookkeepers.  Bookkeepers make the rules.  None of you see that.  Watch �The Agenda� with Steve Paikin.  VALE and the Chartered Accountants of Ontario sponsor the show, and they&#39;ll proudly tell you how long they&#39;ve been setting PUBLIC POLICY.  

None of you are aware of this, because none of you think; and Steve Paikin&#39;s shows are for people who can think, so there&#39;s zero risk of discovery.

You can see for yourself, your masters laughing at your idiocy.

All the belief in the world is not going to change that reality....

...back to the Romans.

A society that&#39;s growing as a result of computer science needs to hide the computer science part.  I know more than you do by default.  I&#39;ve simply dedicated more time to any subject you raise than you have to studying it.  It doesn&#39;t matter what you believe...this is simply true.  

I don&#39;t possess any mental powers you don&#39;t; and I don&#39;t possess any mental powers that the bookkeeper with �dancing-numbers-in-his-head� has.  

You can see where this is going.

Discovery of computer science is inevitable, and accountants will find it first.  I&#39;m not going to find any gold in the Klondike if I don&#39;t go to the Klondike.  You&#39;re not going to find computer science if you don&#39;t go to where math is used constantly.

So, the problem is reduced to one simple goal.  How do you stop a smart, little bookkeeper from discovering computer science, without affecting the quality of his work?  Enter the Roman Numeral system.  

Literacy was restricted to the upper casts; and the ignorant will leap and cling to what they can understand.  In less than one generation the Roman Numeral system was injected into society with the DECLARATION, �This is math!�

...and there you have it.  The next generation will truly believe that Roman Numerals are actual numbers.  They show the math function, and thus no one has reason to believe that the declaration, �This is math� was a lie, or that anyone&#39;s agenda was being served by believing that lie.

Such beliefs cause the believers of Roman Numerals to say that those �crazy people� who have no faith in the Roman Numeral system and their kooky religious terms like fast Fourier transform (FFT), Fibonacci  Sequences, and calculus are just products of their ignorance...

...is this sounding familiar?

Do you get the idea?

And so we return to ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD.

In the comments below I&#39;ll go step-by-step through the very base principles your beliefs have made you blind to.  Unlike any other time in history, we all have the wealth of human knowledge at our fingertips.  The ONLY weapon that those who work against your interests possess, is your ignorance.  Belief is what gives ignorance VALUE to them.

Ignorance serves those working against your interests.

The people who sell you these FRAUDS are so effective because they truly believe in them, and of course that belief serves another unseen agenda...

...because the people that mean you harm, don&#39;t actually know you.  It&#39;s not personal.  You&#39;re a cow to be herded, because THEY took the time to learn things YOU didn&#39;t.

And to the adults with imaginary friends, I dare say you attribute every �good� quality in you to that imaginary friend; and all the bad qualities in you, you attribute to yourself, because you&#39;re �a horrible wretched sinner� that needs �forgiving� for some unknown crime called �sin�.  

There really are people that laugh at the fact that immorality is sold as morality.  It gives them comfort that in 2013, declaring that you&#39;re an adult with an imaginary friend is not only �normal�, but is in fact a prerequisite for becoming President of the United States.

I&#39;m told that Governor of Alaska is another possibility too.

I&#39;m still trying to figure out why stating the truth is �ego�.  It is always the first motivator that I&#39;m accused of.  I suspect it&#39;s loosely connected to the other strange belief that people&#39;s hurt feelings make my position wrong; and if they&#39;re Christian they seem to think some sort of harm should come to me as a result. They counter this vile thought with some empty expression of �love�, because Love hasn&#39;t been diminished by belief enough!

You have to see things from my perspective as well.  When you declare that you&#39;re �offended�, there&#39;s an automatic process that I programmed, with intent in my head, and it routes all data from that point on, to the same place in my head that I route whining.  For, in the end, when you say that you&#39;re offended, you should just presume that my response is, �So what?�  You&#39;re whining does not change what I said.

All that being said, I request you, friends, comrades, brothers, sisters, to try to keep the banter to a minimum; and I know I&#39;m as guilty as you are for this...

I&#39;ve had a good stern talk with myself on the subject regarding this thread.

I am going to go through this whole document of THE ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD.  We&#39;re going to play �Biology Class� with this piece of LEGAL BULLSHIT.

I am going to put this fake �living document� (powered by �Belief�) on the stainless steel table, and while it cries out for mercy, I shall carve out its entrails, piece-by-piece.  And we shall examine these entrails while it writhes in pain.

And then we&#39;ll toss away those pieces because they don&#39;t survive the light of understanding.  At the end of our little legal biology class, with two goals accomplished, you will see the ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD for what it is, and I will have given it the slow and painful execution it so richly deserves.

    THE TENDER FOR LAW � THE UCC FOR IDIOTS (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License. 

THIS ALSO SERVES AS PART II of ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD (OPPF)

As promised, I am now going to cover the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE (or UCC, for you idiots who type with your thumbs.)

FUCK! Myths about THIS shit, sure has �done the rounds�, hasn&#39;t it? No more myths have been generated, out of a piece of regulation, than the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE!

The dumbed-down, but very accurate, explanation is that the UCC is a standardized LEGAL mechanism, to resolve disputes in commerce, where such commerce utilizes the world reserve currency.

At the moment, the world reserve currency is the US DOLLAR.  This doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s American law, but it most certainly covers the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA and all the US shores and waterways.  

ITS DEFAULT ROLE IS TO DETERMINE JURISDICTION

If you watched Money as Debt III, you saw a brief explanation as to WHY gold became a world currency.  It was universally accepted, around the world.

The UCC provides this very same function by being the very LAW you TENDERED when you used the US DOLLAR.  This effectively means the UCC covers the UNITED STATES and any JURISDICTIONS, real or implied, which can and/or do use the US DOLLAR.

In order to make use of the UCC, you must either be in the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, and/or in one of the waters, shores or tributaries of the UNITED STATES, and/or conducting business in US DOLLARS.  

I, for one, love the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE.  If you have a fleet of ships and you do business in AMERICAN DOLLARS, and don&#39;t have any debt, you&#39;re pretty much as free as a human being can get in 2013.

If there is anyone that says the UCC is anything else, they are, in fact, lying to you.  The purpose behind the UCC is to have COMMON INTERNATIONAL LAW regarding COMMERCE. ABOVE ALL;ITS DEFAULT ROLE IS TO DETERMINE JURISDICTION!

...idiots. (Yes, as a matter of fact I DO have to say that! FUCK OFF!)

The UCC allows certain presumptions regarding accounting that would simply be impractical in a corporate environment.  The fact that roles are clearly defined, and MARITIME ADMIRALTY LAW is heavily integrated, makes owning a ship, or even better, a fleet of ships, a very liberating idea, for the UCC protects you. The UCC guarantees that other users of THE TENDER FOR LAW that offered this JURISDICTION, will protect your interests by presumption.  

This whole �Dean arrest thing� has distracted me from my larger goal, and now I have to stop and dumb things down.  I certainly hope my explanation of the UCC is clear enough.

Now ponder how stupid a CLAIM against such �constructs� actually is.
OK, you know what?...you&#39;re all too stupid...I&#39;m going to have to explain it.

Let&#39;s cover a few fundamentals.  I&#39;ll try not to use large words so the �BELIEVERS� won&#39;t get confused.

A TRUST IS NOT A PERSON.  

A GOVERNMENT IS NOT A PERSON, AND
 
A JUDICIARY IS NOT A PERSON.

A human that is registered with the NON-PERSON GOVERNMENT IS A PERSON.

A human, and that stripper they fucked last year and has since squirted out a NEW human, and THEREFORE, said NEW human is registered with the NON-PERSON GOVERNMENT IS A PERSON. (That&#39;s what you get for fucking strippers) 

A CORPORATION IS A PERSON.

ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD poses as a �TRUST�.  A TRUST cannot make a CLAIM.  Only a PERSON can make a CLAIM.  

The GRANTORS of the TRUST have NO STANDING to make a CLAIM once the TRUST is commissioned.  They have no more power to do so than the guy, whose signature is on a Ten Dollar bill, has the AUTHORITY to tell you how to spend it.

ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD, and their ilk, will happily talk as EXPERTS on the UCC, and I&#39;m pretty sure NONE of them has actually used the UCC.

So, let&#39;s do a side-by-side comparison as to who is more qualified to speak on this subject:

I, unlike OPPF and �FREELOADERS-ON-THE-LAND�, have actual VALUE.  As I type this the general consensus of the LEGAL AND BANKING SYSTEM says that I can, without question, UNDERWRITE half a Billion Dollar&#39;s worth of BONDS converted to MONEY OF EXCHANGE.  Think about that.  On a whim, I could inject half a Billion Dollars into the economy.  This means that unless you use those dollars to purchase my value, the entire net worth of the country will drop by half a Billion Dollars.  

If you think it&#39;s frightening that one privileged man wields the power to do this sort of thing, pat yourself on the back because that is the proper response.  Ethics is the only thing that stops me from doing that.  But that doesn&#39;t really help much in COMMERCE.  An ethical guy with a gun, in the end, is still just a guy with a gun....

�.Enter the UCC.

The UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE in COMMERCE, only recognizes whatever currency is the world reserve currency.  This of course is the US DOLLAR.  This means that every other currency touched by the INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND is simply �acting� as a US DOLLAR (or part thereof).
Muammar Gaddafi was wiped off the face of the earth, because he dared point out that the world&#39;s currencies are propping-up the dead, hollowed-out carcass that is the UNITED STATES.  He raised the point that, according to the little, green book that got him into office, He was pretty sure that LIBYA&#39;S economic wealth was to go to its people.

I hear people stating that the war on LIBYA was ILLEGAL.  Sadly it wasn&#39;t.  The UCC made it perfectly LEGAL.  

LAW IS A TRUST.  According to the TRUST, Gaddafi&#39;s attempt to change the currency was a BREACH OF THAT TRUST.  

THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE can be viewed as the grand, de facto law that exists where no other de facto law exists.  

Therefore according to IMF TREATIES, if there&#39;s no law at a particular place, the UCC is DEEMED to be the de facto law.

You will notice that there is nothing to LIEN or FORECLOSE ON in the UCC.  UCC is a �legal traffic cop�, directing traffic to its appropriate JURISDICTION.  

Treating a TRUST like a PERSON makes any further documents produced as a result, FRAUD. Such documents are OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT.  

In short, ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD is, by its very nature, based on an ILLEGAL concept.

...but that&#39;s not the worst of it. UCC, like any OTHER TRUST is based on CONSENT. Let&#39;s look into LEGAL UTOPIA! We needn&#39;t bother with silly things like consent. IT&#39;S LEGAL PARADISE! First we must get into the right �headspace�. 

Since all of you like to form uninformed opinions of me, and what a bad man I am, I&#39;ll put this next scenario in the context of �me�, because your self-created loathing of me will allow you to accept this concept, in your empty little heads.

SO, Imagine if you will that I, the KEEPER OF THE AQUILAE TRUST, decided that I wanted to do something FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, because you&#39;re too stupid to do it yourself.  With the arrogant presumption that I even have STANDING to do so, I, without your CONSENT, make a DECLARATION that you get a �chunk of the world&#39;s wealth�; and to ENFORCE that I drafted some AWESOME LAWS, as I do not �believe� (belief is the only thing that would cause a rational human being to think this way) you are capable of managing your own affairs...

...hey wait, this is starting to sound familiar.  But I&#39;m not like the GOVERNMENT, I know what&#39;s best for you!  I&#39;m just here to help;  and anybody who doesn&#39;t want that help is clearly a �hater�, and are jealous... maybe even criminals and psychopaths.  Why, anybody who doesn&#39;t want my help is mentally ill.  That&#39;s safe to say!  In fact, I&#39;d better amend my awesome laws so that I may lovingly and humanely dispose of these mentally ill.

Got the picture?

GOOD.

Now just replace �me� with those �three guys� in ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD, and that is what is being sold to you.  I cannot make this any clearer.

I have just explained what the UCC is.  If you think it&#39;s anything else, you&#39;re �making shit up�.

I use the UCC daily.  AQUILAE has points-of-presence in CANADA, THE UNITED STATES, SINGAPORE, SCOTLAND and ICELAND.  So anybody who dares say they know more about the UCC is publicly declaring that I am LEGALLY INCOMPETENT TO MANAGE A TRUST, which is DEFAMATORY; and I deal with that in MY JURISDICTION, and there&#39;s a nice �legal traffic cop� that says I can.  People who want to continue spreading bullshit may find themselves on my �LEGAL AUTOPSY TABLE� where they are used as a live example...

...Because ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD has a lot more than the UCC.  I could show mercy right now and let this FRAUD die as it is; and even though I made some grandiose promises about this document&#39;s horrible fate, I remind you all that mercy is the mark of a GREAT MAN!

...The problem is, I&#39;m just a GOOD man.  

In my next major post I shall cover the procedural FRAUD within the TRUST itself as laid-out in its CHARTER DOCUMENTS.

Watch how it writhes in pain.  * maniacal giggling is permitted *

    Talked to a guy yesterday who says he pays/discharges his bills basically by ACCEPTED-FOR-VALUE, this is how he marks-it-up:

1. Crawford and Falconbridge&#39;s Bills of Exchange book apparently says, all you have to print is ACCEPT at the top of the bill..&#39;ACCEPTED-FOR-VALUE&#39; is not necessary

2. your signature on the front of it

3. &#39;without recourse,&#39; after your signature

4. fill-in the empty &#39;Amount-box&#39;...give them a little more than you supposedly owe, like a tip, make it less likely for them to complain about it

5. put the date

6. your SIN# with no dashes- 123456789

7. print something in regards to section 3. of the Bills of Exchange Act 1985 which states: Thing done in good faith

3. A thing is deemed to be done in good faith, within the meaning of this Act, where it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not.

http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-4/page-2.html#h-3

Interesting how this Federal Government page lists the Bills of Exchange Act as CONSUMER LEGISLATION, and, highlights PART V. in brackets:

    The &#34;BILL OF LADING&#34; thread! - Black&#39;s Law Dictionary, 8th-edition:

A document acknowledging a RECEIPT of goods by a carrier or by the shipper&#39;s agent and the contract for the transportation of those goods; a document that indicates the receipt of goods for shipment and that is issued by a person engaged in the business of transporting or forwarding goods. A negotiable bill of lading is a document of title.

&#34;A bill of lading may be regarded in three several aspects. (1) Its is the receipt given by the MASTER(??) of a SHIP acknowledging that the goods specified in the bill have been put on BOARD(the citizenSHIP); (2) it is the document that contains the terms of the contract for the carriage of the goods agreed upon between the shipper of the goods and the shipowner (whose agent the master of the ship is); and (3) it is a &#39;document of title&#39; to the goods, of which it is the symbol. It is by means of this document of title that the goods themselves may be dealt with by the OWNER of them while they are still on board SHIP and upon the high seas(subject to ADMIRALTY/MARITIME law?)&#34;  Principles of the Law of Contract (1919)

pick your choice of Bill of Lading: bearer.. claused.. clean.. destination.. foul.. LONG-FORM.. NEGOTIABLE.. non-negotiable.. ocean.. onboard.. ORDER.. overseas.. SHORT-FORM.. spent.. straight.. through.. unclean.

    Due to my recent realisation that Admiralty Law is key in understanding the basics, I&#39;d like to start this thread to help comprehend Admiralty and how it equates to Man from the start...

If people would like to post their brief description of how they see it and we can go from there I suppose?

Maybe a good old diagram could be worked on once I have it properly figured out... :)

So, to the beaches!

    New thread regarding &#39;MY home...&#39;

Scott (or anyone more well-informed than I). 

I am currently heading to Kelowna for court tomorrow to attempt to stop the sale of my house by the bank. They are petitioning the courts for the sale at 9:45. I Served them notice that I do not consent to the sale and did not receive PROPER NOTICE regarding the contract and require FULL DISCLOSURE as to whom the parties in the contract are, whom put forth the required CONSIDERATION.

There is more and I can post the full notice if you like. I am mainly just concerned that I have done this properly and what can or should I expect. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

    Ok, so Scott, for a person who wasn&#39;t born in Canada, getting their Citizenship... would that not be the same as a Birth Certificate? They are pledging their &#34;value&#34; to Canada. Do they not have the same rights? Since our Birth Certificate pledges our &#34;value&#34;?

    THE TENDER FOR LAW � SURETY FOR IDIOTS (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve posted an article, and I&#39;ve solidified the &#34;For Idiots&#34; concept. Let&#39;s cover SURETY!

One of the most painful things about being on FaceBook is having to endure the fact that people with chronic Dunning�Kruger effect still think that their ignorance has the same standing as my knowledge; and they will happily state many unkind things regarding my character when I challenge their &#34;pulled-out-of-their-ass&#34; mythology.

Some don&#39;t even go that far, and will simply lie about what I said, and claim I don&#39;t post evidence.  I don&#39;t have to post &#34;evidence&#34;.  I&#39;m not trying to PROVE anything to you.  

That said, this is not a debate centre either.  You assume ALL LIABILITY when you ask to join this group.  This, by default, means you have &#34;SURETY&#34;, because SURETY equals LIABILITY.  I don&#39;t need to provide &#34;proof&#34; of this; as my banning you from the group should be compelling enough to show the difference between who&#39;s in charge, and who&#39;s liable. Who could even argue that? :D

Before we get to the actual issue of SURETY, and why you must avoid it, we must take a quick journey back in time to learn where the legalese that enjoins you came from.  

Those of you who endured the content-free 1.2 decades of the Public Fool System, will remember certain things, not the least of which is Shakespeare.  The plays of Shakespeare are sold to you as &#34;Olde English&#34;.  In fact, it was sold as &#34;Olde English&#34; when these were first-run plays.  There is a problem with this, though.  Nobody ever spoke in the manner that Shakespeare wrote, and they most certainly never used the words.  Shakespeare produced most of his major works between 1589 and 1613, all of which were sold as &#34;Olde English&#34;.  Popular periodicals of the time show that you were often considered &#34;learned and of good taste&#34; if you could speak in this &#34;Olde English&#34;.  

So let&#39;s go read some really, really Olde English.

Let&#39;s pick a really old English document, completely at random.  We&#39;ll pick...The MAGNA CARTA.  

A quick read of any translation of (Originally all British Law was written in LATIN) the MAGNA CARTA will swiftly reveal two things.  The first is that that it&#39;s pretty readable, not backward and convoluted like a Shakespeare play.  There may be a few archaic words you may need to look up (to ascertain their meanings), but it&#39;s still pretty readable, and there are no words that Shakespeare used.  There&#39;s also no letter &#34;U&#34;.  This is a very important fact to remember, because *spoiler alert*, when courts or legal documents refer to &#34;YOU&#34;, they are in fact, granting you SURETY in the matter.  If you look at a WARRANT, or a ticket from a Policy Enforcement Officer, it will have a name and it will then refer to that name as &#34;YOU&#34; from then on.  For example, &#34;JOHN Q PUBLIC, YOU have been charged with (insert bullshit offence here)&#34;.

YOU=SURETY

If you&#39;re ever in a courtroom and do not wish to have the &#34;benefit of SURETY&#34;, you have but to object to being addressed as &#34;YOU&#34;.  There are many ways to do this.  Dean Clifford might say, in response to being addressed as &#34;YOU&#34;, &#34;If I have led the court to believe that I am SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE.  Please forgive me.&#34; (FUN FACT: A court MUST ALWAYS grant forgiveness when asked and/or requested)

Others, like myself, are a lot more succinct.  For example, I might respond, &#34;FUCK YOU!  You&#39;re a YOU, I&#39;m a ME!  By what AUTHORITY do YOU address ME as a &#34;YOU&#34;?&#34;, because I can get away with it.  The reason I can get away with it is that I UNDERSTAND the UCC as opposed to ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD which spreads mythology and bullshit about the UCC.

Now there may be a certain &#34;pretend radio&#34; talk-show host (who speaks in a manner that would suggest he is hosting a show with a dick in his mouth), who would demand &#34;proof of this&#34;, ignoring the fact that the UCC is, in fact, the proof.

Section 1, Subsection 308, of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE covers RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.   This is a well-known fact, and this is how you use it. 

On entering the court, you aggressively make the first motion, that being, the RESERVATION OF YOUR RIGHTS.  But since you&#39;re the only one in the courtroom with ACTUAL STANDING, you can be a total dick about it.  You don&#39;t RESERVE YOUR RIGHTS, you RESERVE ALL RIGHTS!  Not just yours, EVERYONE&#39;s.  You remove everyone else&#39;s rights and give them to yourself.  WHY?  Because &#34;Fuck off that&#39;s WHY!&#34;  You&#39;re the only one with STANDING.

If you HOLD the power, WIELD it...don&#39;t be such a pussy!  If you&#39;re entitled to ALL RIGHTS, CLAIM THEM.  This is how you do it.

When the &#34;justice&#34; starts speaking, interrupt them.  Say, &#34;Point of order!&#34;  They will immediately be silent.  At that point, state &#34;I believe I am the only party with standing, so barring objection from the court, I wish to RESERVE ALL RIGHTS now, and henceforth.  Are there any objections from the court?&#34;  As the court has no standing to respond, simply speak to the record as such, &#34;Let the record show that I have reserved all rights, and the court has not objected.&#34;  At this point if they say anything to you, you simply say, &#34;Objection.  The record shows that I have reserved all rights, and I have not granted you leave to speak.  Why are you speaking?&#34; 

Do the same when opposing counsel attempts to speak.  You will then be posed the question, &#34;How do you wish to proceed in this matter?&#34; for that is the one question a slave has the right to ask.  What is their master&#39;s wish?  

You&#39;ll recall in other articles and comments, the levels of the caste system and how they give instructions.  

NOBILITY (KINGS AND QUEENS) EXPRESS THEIR &#34;WISHES&#34;.

ADMIRALTY ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS BY REQUESTING, ADDRESSING THEIR SUBORDINATES AS &#34;MR&#34;.

GENERALS GIVE ORDERS.

Now even the talk-show host who sounds like he&#39;s got a dick in his mouth, won&#39;t &#34;demand proof&#34; of the fact that if you have all the rights, and everybody else has none, you are CLEARLY the KING.  So you are going to have to learn to give instruction by expressing your wishes.  This is why they are asking how you &#34;wish to proceed&#34;.  Courts grant and test your SOVEREIGNTY all the time.  You simply have to listen to the words they are using.  At this time you may respond, &#34;I wish to prove to some ass-wipe who sounds like he&#39;s got a dick in his mouth, the things I know, so I wish to go to trial PRO SE.  But I wouldn&#39;t recommend this...I would simply wish the case to be dismissed.

If they say anything else besides &#34;I agree, case dismissed&#34;, you exercise your AUTHORITY by questioning.  MASTERS QUESTION, SLAVES ANSWER.  For instance if a &#34;justice&#34; said anything except &#34;I agree. Case dismissed,&#34; you question why they are even speaking.  &#34;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll recall Mr. (insert justice&#39;s name here) that at the beginning of these proceedings I explicitly reserved all rights, including yours. Have I not made my wishes clear?&#34;  

Always remember to respond in the form of a question.  A question serves the dual-purpose of establishing your authority, and negating the possibility of UNDERSTANDING; because if you UNDERSTAND, you accept SURETY.

As stated before, the most powerful of these questions is, &#34;Who are you?&#34;  UNDERSTANDING cannot be presumed until that question is answered.  

Above all, questioning deflects SURETY.

Quite possibly one of the most useful documents I have ever published is my NOTICE OF MISTAKE for Dean.  This is a useful, powerful document that also instantly removes SURETY.  I framed it in such a way that you can replace the name &#34;Dean Clifford&#34; with your name, and you can make a pad of these things.  Have lots of copies to hand out to friends and opposing counsel.  Hell the court clerk loves these things too...make sure the court clerk has one as well.  Just make sure you UNDERSTAND what the document says.  Read it carefully and understand what the words mean, because you will be challenged.  And remember, the NOTICE by its very nature, presents several questions.

Do not permit the proceedings to move forward without these questions being answered!  

Because so many people ask for it, transcribed here is the copy of THE ROGUESUPPORT NOTICE OF MISTAKE.

***Begin NOTICE OF MISTAKE

NOTICE OF MISTAKE

In the matter of SURETY for the LEGAL NAME, I believe that there has been a
MISTAKE as the SOLE BENEFICIARY has been INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED as the
accused. If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR
SUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led the COURT to believe
by responding to �You� and or �DEAN CLIFFORD� and/or SUCH OTHER
IDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am the PARTY
WITH SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE and please forgive
me.

As I have no knowledge of who �You� and or �DEAN CLIFFORD� and/or SUCH
OTHER IDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, I RESPECTFULLY
ASK; by WHAT AUTHORITY is the COURT ADDRESSING me as such?
As the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) has been deposited into the COURT,
WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I, as the SOLE BENEFICIARY of the
TRUST have any SURETY in this matter?

As the GOVERNMENT is the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY on the SURETY BOND
(BIRTH CERTIFICATE), with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL
NAME, WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE for the
LEGAL NAME. WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE and
have ANY SURETY with respect to the LEGAL NAME?

WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a
TRUSTEE or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN?

WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have of any WARRANT OF AGENCY for the
principal?

WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that there has been any meeting of the
minds, any PROPER NOTICE given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or
that I have ANY INTENT to CONTRACT in this matter?

As such, I am returning your OFFER, DECLINED, for immediate DISCHARGE and
CLOSURE.
AUTHORISED BY:

***End NOTICE OF MISTAKE

If you truly UNDERSTAND what this document says and/or does, this is one of the most powerful documents you can wield in court.  If you have the Dunning�Kruger effect you will likely go to jail.  Used properly the NOTICE OF MISTAKE will ALWAYS remove any real or implied SURETY the court believes you may have.  

You will notice the court always refers to &#34;belief&#34;.  When I say belief is evil, it is not just a disparaging remark against adults with &#34;imaginary friends&#34; (which they totally deserve), it is yet another example of why this statement is profoundly true.  All belief is evil.

You are taught from childhood to &#34;respect belief&#34;, and are constantly reinforced with the really dumb freedom that it is your &#34;right to believe what you want&#34;.  If I had the authority and/or power to remove just one right from humanity, and no more, the right to &#34;believe&#34; would be the one that I would eradicate.  In all my years of studying, and being part of the Nobility, the curtailing of this one &#34;RIGHT&#34; would exponentially increase quality of life for all humanity.  I calculate it would take two generations for it to &#34;stick&#34;.

Belief is the end of questioning.  Belief is intellectual bankruptcy, and is the exact opposite of knowledge.  You will never question if you &#34;believe&#34;.  

Let&#39;s leap back to the 1500&#39;s to Shakespeare.  This is where the concept of addressing somebody as &#34;YOU&#34; indicated the assignment of SURETY.  No writings before this contained any such logistic mechanisms.  Don&#39;t &#34;believe me&#34;...go look for yourself.  Go look at the MAGNA CARTA yourself; and ask yourself why there&#39;s no &#34;YOU&#34; before Shakespeare.  And ask yourself why the MAGNA CARTA, in all its current published forms, no longer has, &#34;To do right by Alexander&#34;.  

There may be three readers amongst you who understand what I just said there, and all of them are Scottish I guarantee you.  

In any courtroom proceeding in the western world, SURETY IS PRESUMED, and it must be deflected from you.  As a &#34;justice&#34; is not a PERSON under the law, the only PARTY that can ACCEPT SURETY is the PARTY making the CLAIM.  

There may be certain readers who talk like they have a dick stuck in their mouth, who will demand proof of this...and so I direct you to the Rules of Civil Procedure (wherever you are) to look up SECURITY FOR COSTS.  

Let&#39;s zoom back to the present (so we can get as far away from belief as possible) where the word &#34;YOU&#34; is part of the English language, as are the titles, &#34;Mr.&#34;, &#34;Miss&#34;, and &#34;Mrs.&#34;.  All of these titles and means of addressing you, are in fact, assigning and/or presuming SURETY...yes, on YOU.  The easiest mnemonic exercise you can do to make deflecting these titles second nature is to replace the titles &#34;Mr.&#34;, &#34;Miss&#34;, or &#34;Mrs.&#34; with the word, &#34;bitch&#34;, in your head; and to respond as if they had addressed you as &#34;bitch&#34;, because being addressed as &#34;Mr.&#34;, &#34;Miss&#34;, or &#34;Mrs.&#34; is doing exactly that.  

As for the word &#34;YOU&#34;, think of that as a tennis ball which must be served back.  Assert your AUTHORITY by questioning whenever they address you as &#34;YOU&#34;; &#34;Are YOU addressing ME?&#34;  If they&#39;re stupid enough to say yes, or even to imply the affirmative, be like that guy who talks like he has a dick in his mouth and demand proof; &#34;By what authority do YOU address me as a PARTY OF SURETY?&#34;...or something along those lines.  Your only objective is to serve the &#34;YOU&#34; back to them.

So that&#39;s today&#39;s word, &#34;SURETY&#34;.  It&#39;s something you don&#39;t want, and I&#39;ve just shown you how to give it back.  I&#39;d like to thank my involuntary guests, Dean Clifford, and the guy that talks like he&#39;s got a dick in his mouth.  Since I was so liberal with their identities, I certainly have no problem putting in a free plug for a &#34;pretend radio&#34; show.

So here&#39;s a link to Dean Clifford talking about family court rules or something...hosted by a guy who sounds like he&#39;s got a dick in his mouth.  And before Pierre thinks I&#39;ve &#34;soft-balled this one in there&#34; for him, I&#39;m now going to presumptively say, &#34;Yes Pierre, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s Dean&#39;s dick he&#39;s sucking&#34;.

    I need to make something very clear here.

Of late I have been approached by several parties asking me for analysis, to join groups, etc., because they seem to think that I&#39;m good at this whole &#34;articling&#34; thing...and really I can hardly blame them.  But here&#39;s the problem...

All of these requests are based on the presumption that I have some sort of altruism, and that I&#39;m doing this out of the goodness of my heart, or to share or to enlighten, or for whatever self-made mythology you&#39;ve conjured about me.  I assure you that this is not the case.  

I am doing this whole venture because I took an oath, and I was ordered to.  If I take an oath I comply with that oath to the best of my abilities.  When I am ordered to use those abilities to the service of that oath, I do my best to be sure it&#39;s perfect...or as close as possible.

I don&#39;t do this because I think you deserve it.  I don&#39;t do this because I like you.  In fact, if all of you were to die horribly and painfully tomorrow I would give not a single fuck.

Let&#39;s point my Care Factor Meter at the thought of your universal demise E[\......]F.

See?  Care Factor = 0.  I have absolutely no fucks to give about the thought of your demise.

I really hope that&#39;s clear.  I&#39;m not your friend.  I don&#39;t even like you.  In fact I would really like it if you were taken by one of these &#34;Gurus&#34;.  I would like to see you hauled into court, and I would like to watch you get your ass kicked.  This thought amuses me, but I&#39;ll return here to reality, where I still don&#39;t give a shit if you all die.

Please stop thinking I am some potential shill for your causes.  I answer your questions because I was ordered to...nothing more.

If you have any questions regarding these orders, you can save us both a lot of time and aggravation by assuming I will answer, &#34;None of your Fucking Business!&#34;

    THE TENDER FOR LAW � LEGALESE FOR IDIOTS (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

It&#39;s feast or famine around here at THE TENDER FOR LAW.  This is article number two in as many days!

Derek Moran says that he finds it difficult to believe that I will be able to top the SURETY article...CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. 

It is almost midnight on Sunday, I&#39;m on the bridge of the Tycho-Brahe, and as I look out onto the lake the water is like a sheet of glass...and it&#39;s not even frozen.  How can I not produce a superior article tonight?  So today, with all my &#34;God&#34; complex, &#34;arrogance&#34;, and the knowledge that a host of &#34;pseudo radio&#34; is reading my superior work, and knowing that all he can do is tremble in impotent fury.  Things are so good I can cover the bad aspects of law, namely its language.

Some of you may have already started to figure this out, but every single word in a legal document is designed specifically for the purpose of trapping you.  Even words like AND, OR, IS, MAY, SHOULD...all of these are traps!  And law dictionaries use them perfectly.  You may have noticed words like UNDERSTAND don&#39;t mean what you think they mean.  This is the lowest of the low-hanging fruit in the legal world.  What I am about to teach you here is the legalese equivalent of &#34;code breaking&#34;.  

Let&#39;s jump back to the 1500&#39;s...

This is the time in our civilization that we often refer to as the Renaissance.  The reason the Renaissance occurred is that whole shitloads of people were dying of various forms of plague, and rat-shit-covered scientists were baffled as to why this virulent disease was spreading everywhere.  

The practical result of all this was that a whole shitload of people died, and the ones that made it, inherited all their possessions.  Efforts to communicate more efficiently became a social priority, because there was lots to do to maintain all this new property, and not enough people to do it.  For nearly 800 years &#34;God&#34; was everything, despite his demonstrable lack of assistance in this era.  You see the age where &#34;God&#34; was everything was called the &#34;dark ages&#34;.  Every time I hear an adult with an &#34;imaginary friend&#34; talk about how &#34;ignorant and closed-minded&#34; I am, all I see is an individual that wishes to return to that horrible time.  

As there were fewer people in the 1500&#39;s, and the Renaissance was just getting underway, inherited art was often used as currency.  The next generation had a higher literacy rate than the previous, and so administrative rules were born.  It doesn&#39;t take a &#34;Rocket Scientist&#34; to see how useful slipping Shakespeare in around the latter half of the 1500&#39;s would be to those few who don&#39;t actually do any work.  The false profession of &#34;law&#34; was born.

You&#39;ll notice that nobody ever &#34;does&#34; law.  They only &#34;practice&#34; it.  They keep practising and practising, but they never quite get it right (that&#39;s what you get for not subscribing to the TENDER FOR LAW!).  

From the 1500&#39;s to the present, there has been an odd phenomenon regarding language.  English is a Germanic language that merged with the language of the Angols (we will discuss the Angols and the Picts in another article).  Germanic influence on the language of the Angols resulted in the Latin-to-English written in the MAGNA CARTA.  But if you try to learn German today, you&#39;ll notice an interesting phenomenon.  Though the words you use sound startlingly similar, and the really observant can actually pick out the words when German speak and get a general idea of what they&#39;re saying, even if they don&#39;t speak the language.  Except further study shows that the Germans speak &#34;backwards&#34; grammatically.  Jumping to the south-west, Spanish, a much simpler language, where every vowel is a syllable, and words say what they mean, but once again, &#34;grammatically backwards&#34;.  Head north-east in our mental European map...to France...well France is filled with French people so we needn&#39;t bother with them.  Those French have a different word for everything, and their language is, you guessed it, &#34;grammatically backwards&#34;.  

Those of you noticing the pattern here will not be using too much intellect when they start posing the question, &#34;Maybe we&#39;re the ones that are backwards&#34;.  And that is almost, but not quite true.

Like a virus, legalese infected the English language.  It&#39;s encouraged to this day to use legalese to appear &#34;smart&#34;.  This is done on purpose.  It is an insidious piece of social engineering.

They want you to try to use these words without knowing what the little words mean.

IT&#39;S ALL ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS.

When you read, you read from left to right on a page.  The small words actually exclude part of the sentence.  You will notice in my now famous, NOTICE OF MISTAKE, that I always use &#34;and/or&#34;.  I do this on purpose, because I like to keep my options open.  

Maxims of Law say it plainly.  The inclusion of one thing excludes all others.  The definition of a PERSON in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA is the most hysterical example of this. The definition of PERSON is hidden in the larger scope of &#34;every one&#34;.  The common law maxim, &#34;The INCLUSION of one is the exclusion of another&#34; means in the context of the CRIMINAL CODE INCLUDES &#34;Her Majesty&#34; AND an &#34;organization&#34;.  See for yourself:

*** THE CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA***
�every one�, �person� and �owner�

� quiconque �, � individu �, � personne � et � propri�taire �

    �every one�, �person� and �owner�, and similar expressions, include Her Majesty and an organization;

**********************************

You will find this by searching for R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 under the Interpretations Section.

In reality, what this says is that a &#34;PERSON&#34; is &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;.  Unless you are &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34; people answering to these acts and statutes are simply &#34;performing these acts&#34; (remember Shakespeare) on &#34;HER MAJESTY&#39;s&#34; behalf, much like the GOVERNOR GENERAL PERFORMS royal duties on the Queen&#39;s behalf.  This is why the GOVERNOR GENERAL is always a chosen CITIZEN, and not an elected official.  

The GOVERNOR GENERAL ACTS as the Queen when the Queen is not in town.  This of course has nothing to do with &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;.

When dealing with the LAW, in CANADA anyway, you are always dealing with &#34;HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA&#34;, which as we all know is a CORPORATE ORGANIZATION.  

&#34;OR&#34; means you have a choice, &#34;one&#34; OR the &#34;other&#34;, but not BOTH. 

So, in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA, a PERSON can be &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;.  A PERSON can be &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;, but a PERSON must also be an &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;.  Notice it does not say &#34;OR&#34; an organization in the above interpretation.  Confused yet?

That happens in Legalese. Let&#39;s, instead of looking at this dry, depressing CRIMINAL CODE stuff, look at something happy, exciting and real.  

I can say with absolute certainty that no woman on the planet has loved me more than Tara.  However, no amount of love would compel her to JOINDER herself to a &#34;BILL OF LADING&#34;, and hand it over to the GOVERNMENT. That means &#34;getting married&#34; (for the stupid amongst you).  I&#39;m sorry if that sounds condescending (that means talking down to people).  

Now think about this marriage transaction.  The marriage INCLUDES &#34;Scott&#34; AND &#34;Tara&#34;, not &#34;Scott&#34; OR &#34;Tara&#34;.  This means marriage makes you effectively ONE PERSON UNDER THE LAW.  Since the marriage actually consists of THREE ENTITIES, &#34;Scott&#34; AND &#34;Tara&#34;, which by its nature EXCLUDES the GOVERNMENT, still remains an &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;.  A marriage ORGANIZES these &#34;entities&#34; into their respective roles.  If &#34;Scott&#34; AND &#34;Tara&#34; remain &#34;Scott AND Tara&#34;, the GOVERNMENT HAS NO STANDING.  However, if Tara sought a divorce, the MARRIED PERSON is no longer &#34;Scott AND Tara&#34;, and the GOVERNMENT gets to intervene.

This most certainly wouldn&#39;t be the case if it was &#34;Scott&#34; OR &#34;Tara&#34;.  Therefore, the above CRIMINAL CODE definition of &#34;PERSON&#34; defines HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ***INSERT PROVINCE HERE***, which is both &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34; AND an &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;.  

Every one who is CHARGED in CANADA is usually CHARGED by their PROVINCE.  For instance, if I were to take the ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD lawyer &#34;Heather&#34; and bash her skull into jelly with a ball-peen hammer (as she so richly deserves), I would likely be CHARGED with HOMICIDE in the JURISDICTION where I chose to do this &#34;skull-bashing&#34;.  As I&#39;m a profoundly lazy man I probably wouldn&#39;t travel, so ONTARIO would be the JURISDICTION.  This makes &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34; AND the &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;, &#34;HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO&#34;.  Since all ACTS and STATUTES fall to PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;, this makes all PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34; effectively &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;.  HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO is in fact, an &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;.  You now have the qualifications for a &#34;PERSON&#34; as defined in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA.

Just as the &#34;marriage&#34; consists of &#34;Scott AND Tara&#34;, which effectively creates an &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;, &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34; and the organization defined as &#34;IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO&#34; create a &#34;PERSON&#34; which YOU are presumed to be a PUBLIC SERVANT of.  This effectively means all CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS are simply administrative processes for that &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;.  The NOTICE OF MISTAKE effectively removes that presumption.

You now see how powerful the words &#34;and&#34; and &#34;or&#34; are.  If AQUILAE says the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is &#34;Scott AND Tara&#34;, this would mean neither of us individually could act as CAPTAIN, but &#34;Scott and Tara&#34; could BOTH be CAPTAIN.  This means that all ORDERS from the CAPTAIN must come from BOTH Scott AND Tara.  However, the AQUILAE TRUST is not a stupid document, and the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott OR Tara.  This means that when Tara speaks, everyone shuts the fuck up...including me.  It&#39;s Scott OR Tara - not BOTH!

&#34;AND&#34; refers to BOTH.  &#34;OR&#34; does not.  This is why putting &#34;and/or&#34; gives you the options; and since the AQUILAE TRUST is pretty much perfect, here in reality, the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott and/or Tara.

This means I can ACT as CAPTAIN, Tara can ACT as CAPTAIN, and we can BOTH ACT as CAPTAIN.  Recipients of this POLICY have NO STANDING to contest when we assume and/or drop the role of CAPTAIN.  Why do we do this, you ask?  Because FUCK OFF, THAT&#39;S WHY!  If you&#39;re even looking at the AQUILAE TRUST, you&#39;re a fucking TRUSTEE; and the only reason you should be looking at the AQUILAE TRUST is to find the best way to &#34;Shut the fuck up and do what you&#39;re told&#34; for Scott and/or Tara....

And that is how you make a powerful LEGAL document with the words &#34;and/or&#34;, and the reason why we write things this way.  Use AND &amp; OR to restrict other parties.  Use BOTH (and/or) to free yourself.

If your document is stating the terms, make it as open as possible for YOU, and as restrictive as possible for every OTHER PARTY.  If somebody is thought of as a &#34;good lawyer&#34;, it means they have mastered this skill.  Were I to be practising law, I would be a very, very good lawyer. 

One of our loyal readers made the horrendous mistake of using different words, in another post.  Instead of NOTICE OF MISTAKE he said, NOTICE OF &#34;ERROR&#34;, which means something completely different.  If you look up the legal definition of &#34;mistake&#34; you will notice amongst other things (inter alia) the legal definition of &#34;MISTAKE&#34; ends with &#34;, or error&#34;.  If you are going to learn from the TENDER FOR LAW, you must always remember the Number 1 Rule of the Universe:

SCOTT IS ALWAYS RIGHT!

You can save yourself a lot of time by NOT second-guessing Scott, and proceeding to figure out WHY Scott is right.  

This also means that when I present a document you should presume it&#39;s perfect, and that changing it will fuck you over in ways you don&#39;t even understand.  &#34;NOTICE OF ERROR&#34; is not &#34;NOTICE OF MISTAKE&#34;.  You don&#39;t change the document because you think it &#34;sounds cooler&#34;.  You don&#39;t change the document because you think another cooler-sounding word means the same thing; and I will always interpret such changes as TENDERING AN OFFER to amuse me, by allowing me to berate you for your stupidity, and to laugh at you when a court kicks your ass.  This is a TENDER I will gladly ACCEPT and volunteer for, with the added bonus that I will execute my duties in this TENDER to the best of my abilities.  I&#39;m really good at that too.  

Taking what you have just learned here and reading through ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD, will reveal some very interesting and insidious things.  You&#39;re better off serving me as a slave, because unlike ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD, I won&#39;t lie to you, and I&#39;ll tell you exactly what I mean.  

So there you have it, AND &amp; OR - two hidden keys to legalese and the knowledge that &#34;include also excludes&#34;...and before you ask EXCLUDES includes all that remains.  Use EXCLUDE to get rid of everything else; use INCLUDE to restrict to a single point/item.

The guy with the fake &#34;charity&#34; seeking legal advice actually asked what TENDER means, and it occurs to me that those who AREN&#39;T lying to me might wonder too. TENDER in the context of Law means, &#34;to present to PERSON, an unconditional offer, to enter into a contract&#34;. Look at those words, then look at a bank note. THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER means, &#34;THIS NOTE IS AN UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW&#34;. That is why the group name is so clever. ;) This group is ABOUT that UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW. It&#39;s ALL money.

Money is JOINDER. JOINDER MAY (Read as: &#34;ALWAYS DOES&#34;) INCLUDE SURETY!

THIS is the LEGALESE you need to know. NO MORE. Your ONLY goal should be to REMOVE and/or AVOID SURETY when dealing in commerce and/or LAW. WHEN YOU SIGN A CHEQUE, you are TENDERING SURETY. A BANK NOTE does NOT THENDER SURETY as the SURETY is signed for, by SOMEBODY ELSE.

If you have OTHER LEGALESE questions, post them in the comments. OFF TOPIC COMMENTS WILL BE DELETED. LEGALESE IS A COMPLEX SUBJECT, SO BE PREPARED FOR VANISHING POSTS, and/or BANNING if you do post something OFF TOPIC.

    The All Things &#34;RECUSAL&#34; -thread..... Black&#39;s Law 8th-edition

RECUSABLE: 1. (of an obligation) arising from a party&#39;s voluntary act and that can be avoided. 2. (of a judge) capable of being disqualified from sitting on a case. 3. (of a fact) providing a basis for disqualifying a judge from sitting on a case.

RECUSAL: removal of oneself as judge or policy-maker in a particular matter, especially because of a conflict of interest.

RECUSANT: adjective. refusing to submit to an authority or comply with a command &lt;a recusant witness&gt;

RECUSANT: noun. 1. Ecclesiastical law. a person (esp. a Roman Catholic (?)) who refuses to attend the services of the established Church of England. 2. a person who refuses to submit to an authority or comply with a command.

RECUSATIO JUDICIS (latin): Ecclesiastical law. the procedure and grounds by which a judge may be challenged and removed from hearing a case. The grounds for disqualification traditionally include great friendship or enmity with a party, close kinship to a party, acceptance of a bribe, previously giving counsel to a party, or demonstrated ignorance of the law. A panel of three arbiters, chosen by the challenging party and the judge, decides whether the party&#39;s complaint has merit.

RECUSATION: 1. Civil law. an objection, exception, or appeal; especially an objection alleging a judge&#39;s prejudice or conflict of interest.

RECTUS IN CURIA (latin): &#34;right in the court&#34;. free from charge or offence; competent to appear in court and entitled to the BENEFIT OF LAW (hmm, sounds familiar). See LEGALIS HOMO.

REDDITION: an acknowledgment in court that one is not the owner of certain property being demanded, and that it in fact belongs to the demandant. (&#34;Do you, your Honour, take Judicial Notice of the fact that, i as the DEMANDANT, am the Lawful-Holder-In-Due-Course of the SECURITY of my PERSON, and not that of my public-servants meant to serve me?&#34;  :)

    THE TENDER FOR LAW � CHILDREN&#39;S AID SOCIETY [C.A.S] FOR IDIOTS (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

This article is what we like to call an &#34;emergency article&#34; in as much as Dean Clifford has publicly and blatantly lied about family services and the law.  Before we get started we are going to refer to the JURISDICTION I am most familiar with.  You will find mirrors of this in any JURISDICTION that uses a world reserve currency.

If you live in Buttfuck Montana I will not be able to point you to the ACT and/or STATUTE that says what I am going to show you here.  

http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/English/elaws_statutes_90c11_e.htm

The URL above will point you to the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO so you can sing along...

Before I start let&#39;s review a few LEGAL DEFINITIONS.  Those who have been studying the Maxims of Law will be familiar with the Maxim that says, &#34;The inclusion of one thing is the exclusion of everything else.&#34;  Like all good LEGAL documents I&#39;m going to give away the answer right at the beginning and explain why this is true.

Every one who has been a victim of the CHILDREN&#39;S AID SOCIETY has been profoundly aware that FRAUD is occurring, and has been unaware of how to identify this FRAUD.  In order to have a child removed from a mother and/or father&#39;s custody an ORDER must be issued from the court that cites this very ACT.  There are exceptions to this RULE (imminent physical threat to a child, WARRANT from a JUSTICE OF THE PEACE inter alia), but that&#39;s not what we are covering here.  In this writing I am only going to focus on the long, drawn-out, cash-producing process laughingly called family law.

In every ACT and STATUTE, words are defined in the context of that ACT and/or STATUTE.  If the word &#34;light&#34; is defined in a STATUTE as &#34;darkness&#34;, then in the context of that STATUTE, light means darkness.  A &#34;JUSTICE&#34; orders the kidnapping (and it is kidnapping) and/or alienation of a child with an ORDER in the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO.  So let&#39;s look at the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO.  What does &#34;ORDER&#34; mean in the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO?  Let&#39;s go see the interpretations section and its definitions....

�ORDER� INCLUDES a REFUSAL to make an ORDER; (�arr�t�, ordre et ordonnance�)...WHAT?

...just looking through the ACT to see if there&#39;s a bit more detail here...nope, that&#39;s it.  That&#39;s all it says.  I assume the parties who drafted this ACT were never taught that you should never use the word you&#39;re defining in a definition.

In THE TENDER FOR LAW our standard operating procedure is to look up every single word, even if you think you know what it means; and in every case it always turn out that you don&#39;t.  So let&#39;s go through that sentence, one word at a time.  In our fresh new definition of &#34;ORDER&#34; we are &#34;INCLUDING&#34; something, which in legalese means we are EXCLUDING everything else.  In this case we are including a REFUSAL(?)  How can you include a refusal? (hey don&#39;t look at me...I didn&#39;t write this...I&#39;m just telling you what it says)

Since refusal is not defined in this ACT we&#39;ll have to step up to a more general level.  Let&#39;s see what Black&#39;s Law 9th Edition has to say about the word &#34;refusal&#34;:

&#34;An opportunity to accept or reject something before it is offered to others; the right or privilege of having this opportunity.&#34;...well, there&#39;s a privilege worth waiving!  In fact I dare say that of all the privileges and benefits one would wish to waive, this should at least be in your top five.  Dean Clifford and the guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth (&#34;How do I sound&#34;? - Tony Butros, HOW TO WITH DEAN CLIFFORD-Ep13 Family Law www.blogtalkradio.com) are selling this as a benefit. 

In fact, they&#39;re asking you to beg for it when they tell you to use APPLICATIONS and MOTIONS (...Yeh, you like that don&#39;t &#39;ya bitch!).

Rather than begging for your own victimization, a little effort tearing this apart will serve you much better.  Since we&#39;re talking about ORDERS and MAKING ORDERS let&#39;s take a quick peek at the word &#34;MAKE&#34; since we have Black&#39;s Law lying open here...

MAKE, according to Black&#39;s Law 9th Edition, &#34;To legally perform, as by executing, signing, OR delivering (a document) (to make a contract)&#34;

Oh look, they use the word &#34;OR&#34;!  Don&#39;t you just love it when they give you a selection?  Always remember legalese does NOT actually &#34;lie&#34;, it simply presumes you know what the words mean (as a CIVILIAN! HAR!  Oh, I slay me!).

So when a &#34;JUSTICE&#34; MAKES an ORDER he gets a selection from the &#34;bullshit buffet&#34; that is the LAW, but he can only pick one, OR the other.  Neither of these options actually apply to YOU.  By ACCEPTING the ORDER you are in fact, EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS to &#34;BENEFIT&#34; from it, before everyone else can.  Yes, you are accepting SURETY before anyone else gets a chance; and while I&#39;m not one to tell you how to run your affairs, I personally think that that would be a MISTAKE!  And we all know what to do about MISTAKES.  

Now I want you to &#34;fire up&#34; that little lump of protoplasm you laughingly call a brain, and ask yourself, &#34;Which makes more sense?  Begging to be part of the JURISDICTION and all of its &#34;BENEFITS&#34; or following the Number 1 Rule of the Universe (Scott is ALWAYS right!  Especially as regards LAW).  Lawyers used to come to me when they got in over their heads, and I was shoved A LOT of payola under the table for my services.  Single mothers reading this know how to express their gratitude.  You may APPLY to Tara for the opportunity to provide remuneration.

So let&#39;s go through this fascinating definition one more time, translated to laymen&#39;s terms:

In the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO a &#34;JUSTICE&#34; will issue an opportunity to ACCEPT a BENEFIT before everyone else.  So basically ORDER in this context actually OFFERS YOU the RIGHT TO DECLINE.  I guarantee that none of you who have had your children stolen, DECLINED that ORDER.  In fact I dare say you ACCEPTED it.  That would be a MISTAKE.  

Issuing a NOTICE OF MISTAKE will correct this, because another Maxim of Law says, &#34;That which can be done, can be undone&#34;.  Serving by registered mail a modified NOTICE OF MISTAKE to all participating PARTIES, will remedy this MISTAKE.  

And now we will cover our new &#34;word of the day&#34;, &#34;PETITION&#34;:

PETITION, according to Black&#39;s Law 9th Edition, &#34;A formal written request presented to a court or other official body.&#34;

Those few of you who actually have a fucking clue who I am, know that among my many titles is ADMIRAL.  I exercise my RIGHTS and DUTIES strictly through ADMIRALTY, so I totally know what I&#39;m talking about here.  I, as an ADMIRAL, have TRUSTEES SERVING me.  I do not bark ORDERS at my TRUSTEES.  I only do that to my inferiors.  My TRUSTEES are most certainly NOT my inferiors.  When I need a task performed for AQUILAE I REQUEST.  Returning to the definition of PETITION you will see that this is also a request.  I therefore PETITION my TRUSTEES to execute tasks on behalf of the TRUST.  TRUSTEES do not serve an ADMIRAL; an ADMIRAL SERVES HIS TRUSTEES.  The &#34;payment&#34; for this &#34;service&#34; is the TRUSTEE&#39;S OATH to GRANT ALL MY REQUESTS.  It is the COURT&#39;s DUTY to do the same.

This group&#39;s name &#34;THE TENDER FOR LAW&#34; is actually a translation to layman&#39;s terms of &#34;THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER&#34;.  They mean the same thing.  So naturally money comes into the picture.  Remember our group&#39;s Maxim...&#34;Follow the money&#34;.  In this particular case we don&#39;t want to follow any money, we want to stop the flow of money.

All of you have heard the old adage, &#34;The buck stops here.&#34;  Translated to legalese, &#34;the buck stops here&#34; = &#34;NON-NEGOTIABLE&#34;.  In the construction of our PETITION we are going to contain, in its body, a cessation of negotiation.  When dissecting documents that have a financial interest, we have learned that documents signed by a &#34;PERSON&#34; are considered NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS under the LAW.  

Therefore in our PETITION, the first words that appear should be NON-NEGOTIABLE.  This is similar to putting &#34;WITHOUT PREJUDICE&#34; on the top of a document.  NEGOTIATE does not mean bargain or haggle, it means to EXECUTE a financial transaction.  NON-NEGOTIABLE literally means &#34;the buck stops here&#34;.  Reading through Black&#39;s Law will show you numerous types of petitions, and reading them in the context demonstrated here will make these petitions very, very clear...even a chick can do it.

At this point I would like everyone to know that I DO NOT provide LEGAL service; I only point you in the right direction.  Therefore I cannot draw up a petition for you as I did with the NOTICE OF MISTAKE.  NOTICE OF MISTAKE existed in the real world before I typed up any document regarding it.  Therefore I was quoting, which means I have not stepped outside of any LEGAL restriction.  When The second I issue a petition you can bet your sorry, incompetent asses I&#39;ll be quoting it here.  Until that happens though, you&#39;d best use the comments section to ask any questions you may have.  For the sake of your children do not listen to Dean and the guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth; they are deliberately misleading you!  When you discover this is true (and you will if you listen to them), you are welcomed to board any AQUILAE vessel and beg me for forgiveness where I promise there will be a loyal and capable TRUSTEE standing by to kick you in the face, and toss you overboard.

So post your questions and keep on topic. As this is the most important thread, our fun banter is not permitted here!

...except when I do it.

    Totally boosted from ChiefRock Sino General&#39;s group! What? It&#39;s relevant...shut up!

Maa Nathltaapaan finally decided THE TENDER FOR LAW is worth a peek, so in the white-man tradition I&#39;ll boost his stuff :P

The big difference is... nobody loses, and everyone gains. He&#39;s a very welcome addition to the group. He, AND Sino know how to dig up the legal dirt! I can&#39;t wait to see what gems will surely appear.

    DEAN SPEAKS OUT - OK, not really. He just tries to scare you with vague &#34;consequences&#34;, but I&#39;ve wrestled with Scientologists, so Dean&#39;s method of &#34;discrediting&#34; is amateur-night stuff. It is important to ME that you all have things clear in your heads though, so lets walk through the current fear-mongering, and clear up everything in one post (Efficiency)

Dean said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, Quote - Scott: &#34;Yet Dean Clifford squawks about them as if they are the ONLY ANSWER? REALLY?&#34;

Really, so not only do I squawk, but I believe that motions are the ONLY answer? &lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Read this paragraph. Phrased in the form of a question... Ok. I&#39;ll answer it! YES! That is ALL Dean talked about. I wasn&#39;t listening to a special version of the show where only I heard it. There is no OTHER answers, and you will note early on he says &#34;That&#39;s all I want to say about family law&#34;. ALL he talked about was APPLICATIONS and MOTIONS, like appealing to your rapist is a GOOD idea, and ignoring that APPLICATIONS AND MOTIONS = CONSENT. Notice he did not even TOUCH on that issue. He just pretends it&#39;s irrelevant, and claims they &#34;work&#34;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;People who want to believe sensationalists, are welcome to it. I might also suggest you start watching Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, if you prefer sensationalism and preposterous claims. Of course, they cannot compare to Scott at this point, as he has that market locked down. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now I&#39;m sensationalist. I make preposterous claims, OK, if anyone here thinks a claim I made is preposterous, please I REALLY want to prove otherwise. If I make a claim here, I am MORE than prepared to substantiate it. Otherwise this is just trying to vaguely discredit.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Also, yes, motions have worked JUST fine in the past to shut court down. Again, people can believe what they want, I am not arguing. Choose your path, and enjoy. 

Also, as for everyone else expecting an immediate reply to most of this absolute nonsense otherwise apparently the nonsense stands as truth, I have this to point out. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Worked in the past... Entering their jurisdiction and Acting as a Party, has worked in the past... Seriously? THAT&#39;S his rebuttal? What I say is NONSENSE, and MOTIONING and APPLYING is ok. REALLY?

If anything I say is nonsense, please, point out the part where I lost you. I don&#39;t speak Yiddish here.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I WORK FOR A FUCKING LIVING. I&#39;m FUCKING TIRED when I get home, and I&#39;m even MORE fucking tired if this celebration of foolishness that goes on here. You all want a fucking magic phrase, and think it&#39;s all about how your documents are worded or phrased, FFS. All people are capable of around here is talking shit, and THAT is why most of you are doomed. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You&#39;re all bad people who are doomed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tender for law?!?!? Really!?!?!? You honestly think that the Chinese are subject to our law if they hold Canadian currency in reserve, or that they are subject to the USA for holding their currency in reserve. You think that the use of a dollar bill binds you to statutes? Enjoy the stagnant reality that is about to become your education in law.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I didn&#39;t make the law, I just explain it, so what you and I think the Chinese are going to do, is largely irrelevant. THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER, does in fact establish JOINDER (Not &#34;bind&#34;) when you USE it. It&#39;s how commerce is CURRENTLY done. It&#39;s unsustainable. I&#39;m showing EVERYONE how to LEAVE it and still have the benefit WITHOUT JOINDER, but yes according to EVERYTHING IN JURISPRUDENCE, COMMERCE, and PUBLIC POLICY, it DOES establish JOINDER.

Pretending it does not ignores reality. The people ENFORCING the LEGAL aspects don&#39;t care what the Chinese will do. They don&#39;t care what Dean believes, and they CERTAINLY don&#39;t care which one of US you believe.

Use your heads. Look at everything I write (ESPECIALLY the C.A.S. article) and look for YOURSELF. READ what he is saying, and read what I am saying. He is giving BAD ADVICE. A MOTION and/or APPLICATION also makes JOINDER. Pretending it does not is just stupid! AGAIN, all he has to say about his bad advice is &#34;it&#39;s worked in the past&#34;, completely ignoring the JOINDER issue. Special Appearance means you cannot APPLY or MOTION ANYTHING. DOING SO MAKES YOU SURETY!

I saw your post on feudal decline due to Jewish economic influences, perhaps you should read some of this.

In all of history there has been but one successful protest against an income tax. It is little understood in that light, primarily because the remnants of protest groups still exist, but no longer wish to appear to be &#34;anti-government.&#34; They don�t talk much about these roots. Few even know them. We need to go back in time about 400 years to find this success. It succeeded only because the term &#34;jurisdiction&#34; was still well understood at that time as meaning &#34;oath spoken.&#34; &#34;Juris,&#34; in the original Latin meaning, is &#34;oath.&#34; &#34;Diction&#34; as everyone knows, means &#34;spoken.&#34; The protest obviously didn�t happen here. It occurred in England. Given that the origins of our law are traced there, most of the relevant facts in this matter are still applicable in this nation. Here�s what happened.

The Bible had just recently been put into print. To that time, only the churches and nobility owned copies, due to given to the extremely high cost of paper. Contrary to what you�ve been taught, it was not the invention of movable type that led to printing this and other books. That concept had been around for a very long time. It just had no application. Printing wastes some paper. Until paper prices fell, it was cheaper to write books by hand than to print them with movable type. The handwritten versions were outrageously costly, procurable only by those with extreme wealth: churches, crowns and the nobility. The wealth of the nobility was attributable to feudalism. &#34;Feud&#34; is Old English for &#34;oath.&#34; The nobility held the land under the crown. But unimproved land, itself, save to hunter/gatherers, is rather useless. Land is useful to farming. So that�s how the nobility made their wealth. No, they didn�t push a plow. They had servants to do it. The nobility wouldn�t sell their land, nor would they lease it. They rented it. Ever paid rent without a lease? Then you know that if the landlord raised the rent, you had no legal recourse. You could move out or pay. But what if you couldn�t have moved out? Then you�d have a feel for what feudalism was all about.

A tenant wasn�t a freeman. He was a servant to the (land)lord, the noble. In order to have access to the land to farm it, the noble required that the tenant kneel before him, hat in hand, swear an oath of fealty and allegiance and kiss his ring (extending that oath in that last act to the heirs of his estate). That oath established a servitude. The tenant then put his plow to the fields. The rent was a variable. In good growing years it was very high, in bad years it fell. The tenant was a subsistence farmer, keeping only enough of the produce of his labors to just sustain him and his family. Rent was actually an &#34;income tax.&#34; The nobleman could have demanded 100% of the productivity of his servant except . . . under the common law, a servant was akin to livestock. He had to be fed. Not well fed, just fed, same as a horse or cow. And, like a horse or cow, one usually finds it to his benefit to keep it fed, that so that the critter is productive. Thus, the tenant was allowed to keep some of his own productivity. Liken it to a &#34;personal and dependent deductions.&#34;

The freemen of the realm, primarily the tradesmen, were unsworn and unallieged. They knew it. They taught their sons the trade so they�d also be free when grown. Occasionally they took on an apprentice under a sworn contract of indenture from his father. His parents made a few coins. But the kid was the biggest beneficiary. He�d learn a trade. He�d never need to become a tenant farmer. He�d keep what he earned. He was only apprenticed for a term of years, most typically about seven. The tradesmen didn�t need adolescents; they needed someone strong enough to pull his own weight. They did not take on anyone under 13. By age 21 he�d have learned enough to practice the craft. That�s when the contract expired. He was then called a &#34;journeyman.&#34; Had he made a journey?

No. But, if you pronounce that word, it is &#34;Jur-nee-man.&#34; He was a &#34;man,&#34; formerly (&#34;nee&#34;), bound by oath (&#34;jur).&#34; He�d then go to work for a &#34;master&#34; (craftsman). The pay was established, but he could ask for more if he felt he was worth more. And he was free to quit. Pretty normal, eh? Yes, in this society that�s quite the norm. But 400 some years ago these men were the exceptions, not the rule. At some point, if the journeyman was good at the trade, he�d be recognized by the market as a &#34;master&#34; (craftsman) and people would be begging him to take their children as apprentices, so they might learn from him, become journeymen, and keep what they earned when manumitted at age 21! The oath of the tenant ran for life. The oath of the apprentice�s father ran only for a term of years. Still, oaths were important on both sides. In fact, the tradesmen at one point established guilds (means &#34;gold&#34;) as a protection against the potential of the government attempting to bind them into servitudes by compelled oaths.

When an apprentice became a journeyman, he was allowed a membership in the guild only by swearing a secret oath to the guild. He literally swore to &#34;serve gold.&#34; Only gold. He swore he�d only work for pay! Once so sworn, any other oath of servitude would be a perjury of that oath. He bound himself for life to never be a servant, save to the very benevolent master: gold! (Incidentally, the Order of Free and Accepted Masons is a remnant of one of these guilds. Their oath is a secret. They�d love to have you think that the &#34;G&#34; in the middle of their logo stands for &#34;God.&#34; The obvious truth is that it stands for &#34;GOLD.&#34;)

Then the Bible came to print. The market for this tome wasn�t the wealthy. They already had a handwritten copy. Nor was it the tenants. They were far too poor to make this purchase. The market was the tradesmen - and the book was still so costly that it took the combined life savings of siblings to buy a family Bible. The other reason that the tradesmen were the market was that they�d also been taught how to read as part of their apprenticeship. As contractors they had to know how to do that! Other than the families of the super-rich (and the priests) nobody else knew how to read.

These men were blown away when they read Jesus� command against swearing oaths (Matt 5: 33-37). This was news to them. For well over a millennia they�d been trusting that the church - originally just the Church of Rome, but now also the Church of England - had been telling them everything they needed to know in that book. Then they found out that Jesus said, &#34;Swear no oaths.&#34; Talk about an eye-opener.

Imagine seeing a conspiracy revealed that went back over 1000 years. Without oaths there�d have been no tenants, laboring for the nobility, and receiving mere subsistence in return. The whole society was premised on oaths; the whole society CLAIMED it was Christian, yet, it violated a very simple command of Christ! And the tradesmen had done it, too, by demanding sworn contracts of indenture for apprentices and giving their own oaths to the guilds. They had no way of knowing that was prohibited by Jesus! They were angry. &#34;Livid&#34; might be a better term. The governments had seen this coming. What could they do? Ban the book? The printing would have simply moved underground and the millennia long conspiracy would be further evidenced in that banning. They came up with a better scheme. You call it the &#34;Reformation.&#34;

In an unprecedented display of unanimity, the governments of Europe adopted a treaty. This treaty would allow anyone the State-right of founding a church. It was considered a State right, there and then. The church would be granted a charter. It only had to do one very simple thing to obtain that charter. It had to assent to the terms of the treaty.

Buried in those provisions, most of which were totally innocuous, was a statement that the church would never oppose the swearing of lawful oaths. Jesus said, &#34;None.&#34; The churches all said (and still say), &#34;None, except . . .&#34; Who do you think was (is) right?

The tradesmen got even angrier! They had already left the Church of England. But with every new &#34;reformed&#34; church still opposing the clear words of Christ, there was no church for them to join - or found. They exercised the right of assembly to discuss the Bible. Some of them preached it on the street corners, using their right of freedom of speech. But they couldn�t establish a church, which followed Jesus� words, for that would have required assent to that treaty which opposed what Jesus had commanded. To show their absolute displeasure with those who�d kept this secret for so long, they refused to give anyone in church or state any respect. It was the custom to doff one�s hat when he encountered a priest or official. They started wearing big, ugly black hats, just so that the most myopic of these claimed &#34;superiors&#34; wouldn�t miss the fact that the hat stayed atop their head. Back then the term &#34;you&#34; was formal English, reserved for use when speaking to a superior. &#34;Thee&#34; was the familiar pronoun, used among family and friends.

So they called these officials only by the familiar pronoun &#34;thee&#34; or by their Christian names, &#34;George, Peter, Robert, etc.&#34; We call these folk &#34;Quakers.&#34; That was a nickname given to them by a judge. One of them had told the judge that he�d better &#34;Quake before the Lord, God almighty.&#34; The judge, in a display of irreverent disrespect replied, &#34;Thee are the quaker here.&#34; They found that pretty funny, it being such a total misnomer (as you shall soon see), and the nickname stuck. With the huge membership losses from the Anglican Church - especially from men who�d been the more charitable to it in the past - the church was technically bankrupt. It wasn�t just the losses from the Quakers. Other people were leaving to join the new &#34;Reformed Churches.&#34; Elsewhere in Europe, the Roman Church had amassed sufficient assets to weather this storm. The far newer Anglican Church had not.

But the Anglican Church, as an agency of the State, can�t go bankrupt. It becomes the duty of the State to support it in hard times. Parliament did so. It enacted a tax to that end. A nice religious tax, and by current standards a very low tax, a tithe (10%). But it made a deadly mistake in that. The Quakers, primarily as tradesmen, recognized this income tax as a tax &#34;without jurisdiction,� at least so far as they went. As men unsworn and unallieged, they pointed out that they didn�t have to pay it, nor provide a return. Absent their oaths establishing this servitude, there was &#34;no jurisdiction.&#34; And they were right. Despite laws making it a crime to willfully refuse to make a return and pay this tax, NONE were charged or arrested.

That caused the rest of the society to take notice. Other folk who�d thought the Quakers were &#34;extremists&#34; suddenly began to listen to them. As always, money talks. These guys were keeping all they earned, while the rest of the un-sworn society, thinking this tax applied to them, well; they were out 10%. The Quaker movement expanded significantly, that proof once made in the marketplace. Membership in the Anglican Church fell even further, as did charity to it. The taxes weren�t enough to offset these further losses. The tithe (income) tax was actually counterproductive to the goal of supporting the church. The members of the government and the churchmen were scared silly. If this movement continued to expand at the current rate, no one in the next generation would swear an oath.

Who�d then farm the lands of the nobility? Oh, surely someone would, but not as a servant working for subsistence. The land would need to be leased under a contract, with the payment for that use established in the market, not on the unilateral whim of the nobleman. The wealth of the nobility, their incomes, was about to be greatly diminished. And the Church of England, what assets it possessed, would need to be sold-off, with what remained of that church greatly reduced in power and wealth. But far worse was the diminishment of the respect demanded by the priests and officials. They�d always held a position of superiority in the society. What would they do when all of society treated them only as equals?

They began to use the term &#34;anarchy.&#34; But England was a monarchy, not an anarchy. And that was the ultimate solution to the problem, or so those in government thought. There�s an aspect of a monarchy that Americans find somewhat incomprehensible, or at least we did two centuries ago. A crown has divine right, or at least it so claims. An expression of the divine right of a crown is the power to rule by demand. A crown can issue commands. The king says, &#34;jump.&#34; Everyone jumps.

Why do they jump? Simple. It�s a crime to NOT jump. To &#34;willfully fail (hey, there�s a couple of familiar terms) to obey a crown command&#34; is considered to be a treason, high treason. The British crown issued a Crown Command to end the tax objection movement.

Did the crown order that everyone shall pay the income tax? No, that wasn�t possible. There really was &#34;no jurisdiction.&#34; And that would have done nothing to cure the lack of respect. The crown went one better. It ordered that every man shall swear an oath of allegiance to the crown! Damned Christian thing to do, eh? Literally!

A small handful of the tax objectors obeyed. Most refused. It was a simple matter of black and white. Jesus said &#34;swear not at all.&#34; They opted to obey Him over the crown. That quickly brought them into court, facing the charge of high treason. An official would take the witness stand, swearing that he had no record of the defendant�s oath of allegiance. Then the defendant was called to testify, there being no right to refuse to witness against one�s self. He refused to accept the administered oath. That refusal on the record, the court instantly judged him guilty. Took all of 10 minutes. That expedience was essential, for there were another couple hundred defendants waiting to be tried that day for their own treasons against the crown. In short order the jails reached their capacity, plus. But they weren�t filled as you�d envision them. The men who�d refused the oaths weren�t there. Their children were. 

There was a &#34;Stand-in&#34; law allowing for that. There was no social welfare system. The wife and children of a married man in prison existed on the charity of church and neighbors, or they ceased to exist, starving to death. It was typical for a man convicted of a petty crime to have one of his kid&#39;s stand in for him for 30 or 90 days. That way he could continue to earn a living, keeping bread on the table, without the family having to rely on charity. However, a man convicted of more heinous crimes would usually find it impossible to convince his wife to allow his children to serve his time. The family would prefer to exist on charity rather than see him back in society. But in this case the family had no option. The family was churchless. The neighbors were all in the same situation. Charity was non-existent for them. The family was destined to quick starvation unless one of the children stood- in for the breadwinner. Unfortunately, the rational choice of which child should serve the time was predicated on which child was the least productive to the family earnings.

That meant nearly the youngest, usually a daughter. Thus, the prisons of England filled with adolescent females, serving the life sentences for their dads. Those lives would be short. There was no heat in the jails. They were rife with tuberculosis and other deadly diseases. A strong man might last several years. A small girl measured her remaining time on earth in months. It was Christian holocaust, a true sacrifice of the unblemished lambs. (And, we must note, completely ignored in virtually every history text covering this era, lest the crown, government and church be duly embarrassed.)

Despite the high mortality rate the jails still overflowed. There was little fear that the daughters would be raped or die at the brutality of other prisoners. The other prisoners, the real felons, had all been released to make room. Early release was premised on the severity of the crime. High treason was the highest crime. The murderers, thieves, arsonists, rapists, etc., had all been set free. That had a very profound effect on commerce. It stopped. There were highwaymen afoot on every road. Thugs and muggers ruled the city streets. The sworn subjects of the crown sat behind bolted doors, in cold, dark homes, wondering how they�d exist when the food and water ran out. They finally dared to venture out to attend meetings to address the situation. At those meetings they discussed methods to overthrow the crown to which they were sworn! Call that perjury. Call that sedition. Call it by any name, they were going to put their words into actions, and soon, or die from starvation or the blade of a thug. Here we should note that chaos (and nearly anarchy: &#34;no crown&#34;) came to be, not as the result of the refusal to swear oaths, but as the direct result of the governmental demand that people swear them!

The followers of Jesus� words didn�t bring that chaos, those who ignored that command of Christ brought it. The crown soon saw the revolutionary handwriting on the wall and ordered the release of the children and the recapture of the real felons, before the government was removed from office under force of arms. The courts came up with the odd concept of an &#34;affirmation in lieu of oath.&#34; The Quakers accepted that as a victory. Given what they�d been through, that was understandable. However, Jesus also prohibited affirmations, calling the practice an oath &#34;by thy head.&#34; Funny that He could foresee the legal concept of an affirmation 1600 years before it came to be. Quite a prophecy!

When the colonies opened to migration, the Quakers fled Europe in droves, trying to put as much distance as they could between themselves and crowns. They had a very rational fear of a repeat of the situation. That put a lot of them here, enough that they had a very strong influence on politics. They could have blocked the ratification of the Constitution had they opposed it. Some of their demands were incorporated into it, as were some of their concessions, in balance to those demands. Their most obvious influence found in the Constitution is the definition of treason, the only crime defined in that document. Treason here is half of what can be committed under a crown. In the United States treason may only arise out of an (overt) ACTION.

A refusal to perform an action at the command of the government is not a treason, hence, NOT A CRIME. You can find that restated in the Bill of Rights, where the territorial jurisdiction of the courts to try a criminal act is limited to the place wherein the crime shall have been COMMITTED. A refusal or failure is not an act &#34;committed&#34; - it�s the opposite, an act &#34;omitted.&#34; In this nation &#34;doing nothing&#34; can�t be criminal, even when someone claims the power to command you do something. That concept in place, the new government would have lasted about three years. You see, if it were not a crime to fail to do something, then the officers of that government would have done NOTHING - save to draw their pay. That truth forced the Quakers to a concession.

Anyone holding a government job would need be sworn (or affirmed) to support the Constitution. That Constitution enabled the Congress to enact laws necessary and proper to control the powers vested in these people. Those laws would establish their duties. Should such an official &#34;fail&#34; to perform his lawful duties, he�d evidence in that omission that his oath was false. To swear a false oath is an ACTION. Thus, the punishments for failures would exist under the concept of perjury, not treason. But that was only regarding persons under oath of office, who were in office only by their oaths. And that�s still the situation. It�s just that the government has very cleverly obscured that fact so that the average man will pay it a rent, a tax on income. As you probably know, the first use of income tax here came well in advance of the 16th amendment. That tax was NEARLY abolished by a late 19th century Supreme Court decision. The problem was that the tax wasn�t apportioned, and couldn�t be apportioned, that because of the fact that it rested on the income of each person earning it, rather than an up-front total, divided and meted out to the several States according to the census. But the income tax wasn�t absolutely abolished. The court listed a solitary exception. The incomes of federal officers, derived as a benefit of office, could be so taxed. You could call that a &#34;kick back&#34; or even a &#34;return.&#34; Essentially, the court said that what Congress gives, it can demand back. As that wouldn�t be income derived within a State, the rule of apportionment didn�t apply. Make sense?

Now, no court can just make up rulings. The function of a court is to answer the questions posed to it. And in order to pose a question, a person needs standing.&#34; The petitioner has to show that an action has occurred which affects him, hence, giving him that standing. For the Supreme Court to address the question of the income of officers demonstrates that the petitioner was such. Otherwise, the question couldn�t have come up.

Congress was taxing his benefits of office. But Congress was ALSO taxing his outside income, that from sources within a State. Could have been interest, dividends, rent, royalties, and even alimony. If he had a side job, it might have even been commissions or salary. Those forms of income could not be taxed. However, Congress could tax his income from the benefits he derived by being an officer.

That Court decision was the end of all income taxation. The reason is pretty obvious. Rather than tax the benefits derived out of office, it�s far easier to just reduce the benefits up front! Saves time. Saves paper. The money stays in Treasury rather than going out, then coming back as much as 15 or 16 months later. So, even though the benefits of office could have been taxed, under that Court ruling, that tax was dropped by Congress. There are two ways to overcome a Supreme Court ruling. The first is to have the court reverse itself. That�s a very strange concept at law. Actually, it�s impossibility at law. The only way a court can change a prior ruling is if the statutes or the Constitution change, that changing the premises on which its prior conclusion at law was derived. Because it was a Supreme Court ruling nearly abolishing the income tax, the second method, an Amendment to the Constitution, was used to overcome the prior decision. That was the 16th Amendment.

The 16th allows for Congress to tax incomes from whatever source derived, without regard to apportionment. Whose incomes? Hey, it doesn�t say (nor do the statues enacted under it). The Supreme Court has stated that this Amendment granted Congress &#34;no new powers.&#34; That�s absolutely true. Congress always had the power to tax incomes, but only the incomes of officers and only their incomes derived out of a benefit of office. All the 16th did was extend that EXISTING POWER to tax officers� incomes (as benefits of office) to their incomes from other sources (from whatever source derived). The 16th Amendment and the statutes enacted thereunder don�t have to say whose incomes are subject to this tax. The Supreme Court had already said that: officers. That�s logical. If it could be a crime for a freeman to &#34;willfully fail&#34; to file or pay this tax, that crime could only exist as a treason by monarchical definition. In this nation a crime of failure may only exist under the broad category of a perjury. Period, no exception.

Thus, the trick employed by the government is to get you to claim that you are an officer of that government. Yeah, you�re saying, &#34;Man, I�d never be so foolish as to claim that.&#34; I�ll betcha $100 I can prove that you did it and that you�ll be forced to agree. Did you ever sign a tax form, a W-4, a 1040? Then you did it.

Look at the fine print at the bottom of the tax forms you once signed. You declared that it was &#34;true&#34; that you were &#34;under penalties of perjury.&#34; Are you? Were you? Perjury is a felony. To commit a perjury you have to FIRST be under oath (or affirmation). You know that. It�s common knowledge. So, to be punished for a perjury you�d need to be under oath, right? Right. There�s no other way, unless you pretend to be under oath. To pretend to be under oath is a perjury automatically. There would be no oath. Hence it�s a FALSE oath. Perjury rests on making a false oath. So, to claim to be &#34;under penalties of perjury&#34; is to claim that you�re under oath. That claim could be true, could be false. But if false, and you knowingly and willingly made that false claim, then you committed a perjury just by making that claim.

You�ve read the Constitution. How many times can you be tried and penalized for a single criminal act? Once? Did I hear you right? Did you say once; only once? Good for you. You know that you can�t even be placed in jeopardy of penalty (trial) a second time.

The term &#34;penalties&#34; is plural. More than one. Oops. Didn�t you just state that you could only be tried once, penalized once, for a single criminal action? Sure you did. And that would almost always be true. There�s a solitary exception. A federal official or employee may be twice tried, twice penalized. The second penalty, resulting out of a conviction of impeachment, is the loss of the benefits of office, for life. Federal officials are under oath, an oath of office. That�s why you call them civil servants. That oath establishes jurisdiction (oath spoken), allowing them to be penalized, twice, for a perjury (especially for a perjury of official oath). You have been tricked into signing tax forms under the perjury clause. You aren�t under oath enabling the commission of perjury. You can�t be twice penalized for a single criminal act, even for a perjury. Still, because you trusted that the government wouldn�t try to deceive you, you signed an income tax form, pretending that there was jurisdiction (oath spoken) where there was none.

Once you sign the first form, the government will forever believe that you are a civil servant. Stop signing those forms while you continue to have income and you�ll be charged with &#34;willful failure to file,&#34; a crime of doing nothing when commanded to do something!

Initially, the income tax forms were required to be SWORN (or affirmed) before a notary. A criminal by the name of Sullivan brought that matter all the way to the Supreme Court. He argued that if he listed his income from criminal activities, that information would later be used against him on a criminal charge. If he didn�t list it, then swore that the form was &#34;true, correct and complete,&#34; he could be charged and convicted of a perjury. He was damned if he did, damned if he didn�t. The Supreme Court could only agree. It ruled that a person could refuse to provide any information on that form, taking individual exception to each line, and stating in that space that he refused to provide testimony against himself. That should have been the end of the income tax. In a few years everyone would have been refusing to provide answers on the &#34;gross&#34; and &#34;net income&#34; lines, forcing NO answer on the &#34;tax due&#34; line, as well. Of course, that decision was premised on the use of the notarized oath, causing the answers to have the quality of &#34;testimony.&#34;

Congress then INSTANTLY ordered the forms be changed. In place of the notarized oath, the forms would contain a statement that they were made and signed &#34;Under penalties of perjury.&#34; The prior ruling of the Supreme Court was made obsolete. Congress had changed the premise on which it had reached its conclusion. The verity of the information on the form no longer rested on a notarized oath. It rested on the taxpayer�s oath of office. And, as many a tax protestor in the 1970s and early 1980s quickly discovered, the Supreme Court ruling for Sullivan had no current relevance.

There has never been a criminal trial in any matter under federal income taxation without a SIGNED tax form in evidence before the court. The court takes notice of the signature below the perjury clause and assumes the standing of the defendant is that of a federal official, a person under oath of office who may be twice penalized for a single criminal act of perjury (to his official oath). The court has jurisdiction to try such a person for a &#34;failure.&#34; That jurisdiction arises under the concept of perjury, not treason.

However, the court is in an odd position here. If the defendant should take the witness stand, under oath or affirmation to tell the truth, and then truthfully state that he is not under oath of office and is not a federal officer or employee, that statement would contradict the signed statement on the tax form, already in evidence and made under claim of oath. That contradiction would give rise to a technical perjury. Under federal statutes, courtroom perjury is committed when a person willfully makes two statements, both under oath, which contradict one another.

The perjury clause claims the witness to be a federal person. If he truthfully says the contrary from the witness stand, the judge is then duty bound to charge him with the commission of a perjury! At his ensuing perjury trial, the two contradictory statements &#34;(I�m) under penalties of perjury&#34; and &#34;I�m not a federal official or employee&#34; would be the sole evidence of the commission of the perjury. As federal employment is a matter of public record, the truth of the last statement would be evidenced. That would prove that the perjury clause was a FALSE statement. Can�t have that proof on the record, can we? About now you are thinking of some tax protester trials for &#34;willful failure&#34; where the defendant took the witness stand and testified, in full truth, that he was not a federal person. This writer has studied a few such cases. Those of Irwin Schiff and F. Tupper Saussy come to mind. And you are right; they told the court that they weren�t federal persons. Unfortunately, they didn�t tell the court that while under oath. A most curious phenomenon occurs at &#34;willful failure&#34; trials where the defendant has published the fact, in books or newsletters, that he isn�t a federal person. The judge becomes very absent-minded - at least that�s surely what he�d try to claim if the issue were ever raised. He forgets to swear-in the defendant before he takes the witness stand. The defendant tells the truth from the witness stand, but does so without an oath. As he�s not under oath, nothing he says can constitute a technical perjury as a contradiction to the &#34;perjury clause&#34; on the tax forms already in evidence. The court will almost always judge him guilty for his failure to file. Clever system. And it all begins when a person who is NOT a federal officer or employee signs his first income tax form, FALSELY claiming that he�s under an oath which if perjured may bring him a duality of penalties. It�s still a matter of jurisdiction (oath spoken). That hasn�t changed in over 400 years. The only difference is that in this nation, we have no monarch able to command us to action. In the United States of America, you have to VOLUNTEER to establish jurisdiction. Once you do, then you are subject to commands regarding the duties of your office. Hence the income tax is &#34;voluntary,&#34; in the beginning, but &#34;compulsory&#34; once you volunteer. You volunteer when you sign your very first income tax form, probably a Form W-4 and probably at about age 15. You voluntarily sign a false statement, a false statement that claims that you are subject to jurisdiction. Gotcha! Oh, and when the prosecutor enters your prior signed income tax forms into evidence at a willful failure to file trial, he will always tell the court that those forms evidence that you knew it was your DUTY to make and file proper returns. DUTY! A free man owes no DUTY. A free man owes nothing to the federal government, as he receives nothing from it. But a federal official owes a duty. He receives something from that government - the benefits of office. In addition to a return of some of those benefits, Congress can also demand that he pay a tax on his other forms of income, now under the 16th Amendment, from whatever source they may be derived. If that were ever to be understood, the ranks of real, sworn federal officers would diminish greatly. And the ranks of the pretended federal officers (including you) would vanish to zero. I

    LIABILITY/SURETY...PETITION...WRIT...REPLEVIN...AMICUS CURIAE(or lack of it involved)-thread

This is a 4-minute video showing that even a 12 year-old girl back in the Wild West knew about THE LAW, which provides a free 5-for-1 lesson in the law regarding: LIABILITY = SURETY...PETITION(instead of MOTION)...WRIT(instead of(i think)APPLICATION)...REPLEVIN(one of many forms of a common law WRIT)....and an example of no AMICUS CURIAE being involved at this point: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=714Xl-G5qaI

This, is a 6-minute video showing that even a 12 year-old girl in present-day knows that banks and governments along with corporations, work hand-in-glove in trying to steal our money and keep us as debt-slaves: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx5Sc3vWefE

Moral of this thread?.....aim to be at least as smart as a 12 year-old girl!

    So Scott, in a case of a daughter not being interested awfully much at school (just starting highschool). The School Board had a &#34;hearing&#34; and announce that &#34;daughter&#34; MUST ATTEND and PARENT MUST MAKE SURE, otherwise they THREATEN said parent to confinement and/or $1000 fine in Queens Bench court. So now there&#39;s an &#34;order&#34; for this to happen.

Already put together a Notice of Mistake on her behalf. Wondering what can be added to a NOTICE, as in can you add items to a notice, (as per attached).

They are threatening ME. Does this need to be included in the notice? Is there not lawful regard to threatening anyone?

2.  (1)  For ALL [ALL purposes! Pay attention to that] purposes of ONTARIO LAW,

(a) a person whose birth is registered in Ontario is ENTITLED [Which means you want to WAIVE this.] to be recognized by the NAME appearing on the PERSON&#39;S BIRTH CERTIFICATE or change of name certificate, unless clause (c) applies;

(b) a person whose birth is not registered in Ontario is ENTITLED[Which means you want to WAIVE this.] to be recognized by,

(i) the name appearing on the person�s change of name certificate, if the person�s name has been changed under this Act or a predecessor of it, or

(ii) in all other cases, the name recognized in law in the last place with which the person had a real and substantial connection before residing in Ontario,

unless clause (c) applies; and

(c) a person who adopted a name on marriage before the 1st day of April, 1987 is entitled to be recognized by that name unless the person subsequently changed that name under this Act or a predecessor of it. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.7, s. 2 (1).

So always WAIVE the BENEFIT of section 2.1 of the CHANGE OF NAME ACT.

Any name you are known by is PRIVATE, and NOT DERIVED from a PUBLIC DOCUMENT. Don&#39;t be surety for a THING.

I WAIVE THE BENEFIT OF SECTION 2.1 OF THE ONTARIO CHANGE OF NAME ACT. BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU ADDRESS ME BY ANY NAME, AND/OR, ANY INFORMATION DERIVED FROM ANY PUBLIC DOCUMENT?

    Presumptions of At Law/Statutory/Commercial/Maritime Courts
Canon 3228
A Roman Court does not operate according to any true rule of law, but by presumptions of the law.
Therefore, if presumptions presented by the private Bar Guild are not rebutted they become fact and are therefore said to stand true.
There are twelve (12) key presumptions asserted by the private Bar Guilds that if left unchallenged, they stand true.
Public Record, Public Service, Public Oath, Immunity, Summons, Custody, Court of Guardians, Court of Trustees, Government as Executor/Beneficiary, Executor De Son Tort, Incompetence, and Guilt :
(i) The Presumption of Public Record is that any matter brought before a lower Roman Court is a matter for the public record when in fact it is presumed by the members of the private Bar Guild that the matter is a private Bar Guild business matter. Unless openly rebuked and rejected by stating clearly the matter is to be on the Public Record, the matter remains a private Bar Guild matter completely under private Bar Guild rules; and
(ii) The Presumption of Public Service is that all the members of the Private Bar Guild who have all sworn a solemn secret absolute oath to their Guild then act as public agents of the Government, or �public officials� by making additional oaths of public office that openly and deliberately contradict their private &#34;superior&#34; oaths to their own Guild. Unless openly rebuked and rejected, the claim stands that these private Bar Guild members are legitimate public servants and therefore trustees under public oath; and
(iii) The Presumption of Public Oath is that all members of the Private Bar Guild acting in the capacity of &#34;public officials&#34; who have sworn a solemn public oath remain bound by that oath and therefore bound to serve honestly, impartiality and fairly as dictated by their oath. Unless openly challenged and demanded, the presumption stands that the Private Bar Guild members have functioned under their public oath in contradiction to their Guild oath. If challenged, such individuals must recuse themselves as having a conflict of interest and cannot possibly stand under a public oath; and... Continue&gt;

    Scott mentioned at one time that in Canada we don&#39;t have a sitting government since it was prorogued back in 2008...which coincidentally it was in 2009 when the Government of Canada was rebranded to &#34;Harper Government&#34;...is this all related? I&#39;m having trouble finding the procedures for resuming government after proroguing it, can anyone direct me in the right direction?

    This a very brief r�sum� of what I�ve told the Judge in tax court that I spent the first 12 months on this case learning HOW to file and prepare a petition because I have no lawyer representing me.
I told him, After I filed the petition, I started learning LAW and discovered some weird stuff, first, your honor, I have read the Quebec Income Tax Act, and its says in this act that EVERYTIME the act use the word act and/or law, it INCLUDE an act and/or law OTHER than an act and/or law of the Parliament of Quebec.
So the way I understand this your Honor is that this act/law address a certain group of people, and this group of people seems to be EMPLOYEE and/or AGENT of the Government of Quebec.
So, your Honor, I just want to make sure I had to go trough all this�..since I�M NOT an agent and/or Employee of the government, do I really have to be here your Honor�???
The Judge said: Well you have a very NICE petition here very well made, I would focus on that if I would be you.
I said: Yes, I agree, but I came here to tell the thruth, and I don�t want to be a pain here, I just need to know if my discoveries are TRUE OR NOT�.is it right your HONOR that agent/employee of the government only have to submit to this act.???
Judge said: EVERY CITIZENS have to obey the income tax act�.
I said: I have no Idea whats a CITIZEN your HONOR
Judge said: YOU ARE A CITIZEN
I said: ok your HONOR, if you say I am a citizen its your choice, but I still have no idea of whats a CITIZEN is.
So I went on with my PETITION for a good 5 hours plus�.at the end, I said that I�ve told ALL THE TRUTH here and I don�t owe NOTHING to NO ONE, and I WONT PAY NOTHING to NO ONE
The judge said he believed me, and he said he will give his verdict in a few weeks�.

    Had a visit today from a &#34;policy&#34; man. Someone called to complain about someone riding an atv through the trailer park around the corner from me, (may or may not have been an offspring of mine) in any case I asked if there was any damage to the &#34;complainant&#39;s&#34; property, as I would not stand for that...no reply to that. He asked if I owned a white atv, I said yes, he said, can I have your name? I said, no...he said, you won&#39;t give me your name? I said, why would I do that? he said, cuz you own the atv...I said, so what, do you have any ID? he said, yes (but didn&#39;t produce any) I asked again if there was any damage reported, and what was the crime? he then said (and even wrote it down and gave me his word) that if he could find an offence to charge me under he would...quoted from the little note I have from him: &#34;If there are charges to be laid regarding this atv complaint, I will be laying the charge&#34; signed plc blah blah....I asked what I would be charged under exactly, but he said &#34;you&#39;ll see&#34; lol (apparently we are in grade three) I said so this is what you are about &#34;looking&#34; for an offence to charge someone, because I was uncooperative? again he gave me his word he would be looking for the offence to charge me with ....he wouldn&#39;t hang around despite me trying to get answers to my questions, but wanted me to answer his...I could be the bad guy here but I suppose we&#39;ll see...he did come back long enough to get the plate number off my truck 10 mins later...don&#39;t think I made a friend today.

    I have a hypothetical situation, I would like a hypothetical answer, for entertaintment purposes only, because I am not asking for any kind of advice. If you know what I mean. 
Let&#39;s imagine: a MAN is being mistaken by the NAME, and being IDENTIFIED as SURETY for the NAME/TRUST. The NAME was charged with some criminal stuff, after a fight with his girlfriend&#39;s NAME, and a TRIAL has been set for, lets say April 1st.
Let&#39;s imagine this is in the STATE OF FLORIDA. The MAN is out on BOND. The NAME has now fired his &#34;PUBLIC DEFENDANT&#34;. The MAN has filed the NAME/BC/SURETY BOND into the court file, getting the NAME in the CUSTODY of the court. The MAN has sent the judge, and prosecutor, via registered mail, a NOTICE OF MISTAKE, along with copy of the VOID order, and copy of the BC. He has not filed the NOTICE OF MISTAKE into the court file, hoping this can be resolved in the PRIVATE. The PROSECUTOR got the REGISTERED MAIL NOTICE, and the judge, soon, will as well. TRIAL is set for april 1st.
If You would imagine being in the shoes of this MAN, what steps would be required to make sure this matter is SETTLED and CLOSED, given all the facts so far? Has this MAN missed any steps?
Theorerically, the NOTICE and SURETY BOND should take care of the closing and settleling of this matter, just like the NOTICE asserts. My IMAGINARY friend would have to be very strong to stand on his facts. But ANY hypothetical additional ideas on this matter, are welcome. Like for example: if the MAN gave PROPER NOTICE OF MISTAKE but just via registerd mail, deposited the LEGAL NAME into the CUSTODY of the court, and SURETY BOND has been posted, should the MAN file the NOTICE OF MISTAKE on the court file record?
I would kindly appreciate any response, because that MAN is an IMAGINARY friend I have, and I would hate to have to play with him in IMAGINARY JAIL. Thank you!

    So Scott, I am observing that putting a lien on some/thing/person would exclude becoming a &#34;plaintiff&#34;, rather it is a claim of right? And we do not want to be a &#34;plaintiff&#34;. Therefore, for some/thing/person must become the &#34;plaintiff&#34; in order to get said lien removed.

On that note, is there not a procedure with liens? A notice, failure notice, etc. that must happen? How did you lien the warrant so quickly in Dean&#39;s case?

    The Dictionary of Canadian Law 4th-edition, DISPOSITION: 5. Includes the CONFERRING of a power of appointment and any provision whereby an interest in PROPERTY or a RIGHT, POWER or AUTHORITY over PROPERTY is disposed of, created or conferred and also includes a possibility of REVERTER or resulting TRUST, and a RIGHT OF RE-ENTRY on breach of a condition subsequent. Perpetuities Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. P-5, s.1

CONFER: Grant or bestow. 

GRANT: v. To transfer; to sell; to DISPOSE of.

GRANT: n. 1. The strongest and widest word of GIFT and CONVEYANCE known to the law 2. The distinction to be drawn between a GRANT and a REBATE is this; the essence of a GRANT is the giving of a BENEFIT (i.e. BENEFIT WARRANT), including money, from a (Consolidated Revenue) FUND. The word REBATE on the other hand, refers to the RETURN (Income Tax REBATE?) of a portion of money actually paid. 3. any grant of Crown land, whether by letters patent under the Great Seal, a notification or any other INSTRUMENT whether in fee or for years, and whether direct from Her Majesty or by pursuant to any statute. 4. a RIGHT created or transferred by the Crown, for example the grant of a charter, franchise, patent or PENSION(ahem). 5. PUBLIC MONEY devoted to a special purpose. 6. (a) a grant of probate, (b) a resealed  grant of probate or administration, (c) a grant of administration, or (d) a grant of letters of guardianship of the person or ESTATE, or both, of a minor. 

REBATE: 1. the distinction to be drawn between a grant and a rebate is this. The essence of a grant is the giving of a BENEFIT, including money, from a FUND. The word &#34;rebate,&#34; on the other hand, refers to the RETURN of a portion of money actually paid. 2. a discount; a deduction from a payment.

GRANTOR: a person who makes a grant.

GRANTEE: 1. a person to whom one makes a grant. 2. the person to whom real property is TRANSFERRED by DEED for VALUE or otherwise. 3. Includes the bargainee, assignee, transferee, mortgagee or other person to whom a Bill of Sale is made.

DEED: 1. a document signed, sealed, and delivered, through which an interest, property or RIGHT passes. 2. any instrument whereby real property is conveyed, transferred, assigned to or vested in any person. Real Property Transfer Act. 

DEED OF CONVEYANCE: a mere transfer of title.

CONVEYANCE: 2. includes transfer, assignment, delivery over, appointment, lease, settlement, other assurance and covenant to surrender, payment, gift, grant, alienation, bargain, charge, in cumbrance, limitation of use or uses of in to or out of real property or personal property by writing or otherwise. 3. includes SHIPS, VESSELS, aircraft, trains, and motor and other vehicles.

FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE: a conveyance which defrauds, delays or hinders CREDITORS and others. Toronto Dominion Bank v. Miller (1990)

CREDITOR: 1. a person to whom another person owes a debt. 2. a person entitled to the fulfillment of an obligation. 3. a person having a claim provable as a claim under this Act. Bankruptcy Act 4. For example, the court extended the meaning of the word creditor under the Ontario Act to include any claim against a dissolved corporation whether it be in debt or for unliquidated damages. The definition of CREDITOR was stretched to include a claimant who at the time the acts complained of occurred was unable to state the amount of the debt being claimed (BIRTH CERTIFICATE ?) 5. includes a SURETY or GUARANTOR for the debt due to the CREDITOR. Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. 6. (i) in relation to a WRIT OF EXECUTION, any person entitled to enforce by execution the payment of any money payable pursuant to any judgment or ORDER that is enforceable by execution, and (ii) in relation to a distress, the person who has the power of distress. 7. the person or corporation entitled to receive the amount due on a judgment. 8. includes the person advancing money LENT and the assignee of any claim arising or SECURITY given in respect of money lent. Unconscionable Transactions acts.

REVERT: 1. to return. 2. To fall back into his estate. Carter v. Goldstein (1921)

POWER OF DISTRESS: the right that a person has to enforce the payment of any claim against, or the taking of any goods or chattels out of the possession of, another person by the taking of a personal chattel out of the possession of that last mentioned person otherwise than by the authority of a WRIT OF EXECUTION or other process of a similar nature.

BENEFIT: 1. something that is a favourable or helpful circumstance. To provide LEGAL REPRESENTATION under a contingent fee agreement to a client who is unable to pay for legal services is clearly to confer a benefit on the client. 2. a PENSION; a monetary amount paid under a pension or other plan. 3. a drug or other good or service that is supplied to an eligible person. 4. Compensation or an indemnity paid in money, financial assistance or services. 5. a material acquisition which confers an economic benefit on the taxpayer and does NOT constitute an exemption, i.e. loan or gift. 6. the positive effect of one thing on another, the advantage one thing confers on another. 7. must mean that the individual receiving it ultimately receives a net transfer of resources without expectation for repayment.

    We now deviate from the seriousness that is the TENDER FOR LAW, for some comic relief: It seems Tony Butros feels Dean Clifford has &#34;sold him out&#34; (Meaning that without Dean, Tony&#39;s AMWAY-TO-FREEDOM(tm) scheme has nothing to sell. HAR! :D ) 

...but the comments are GOLD! You MUST be bad if you &#34;befriend Scott Duncan&#34;... 

I haven&#39;t laughed so hard in...about a week, actually. I do some funny shit, so it&#39;s pretty hard for outsiders to make the grade. :D Kudos to Tony &#34;guy-that-sounds-like-he-has-a-dick-in-his-mouth&#34; Butros for bringing us this quality programming. I hope you get the same joy as me :D

          <p>*** WELL IT&#39;S OFFICIAL *** DEAN CLIFFORD HAS ADMITTED THAT HE SOLD ME OUT.  He made his official announcement on his forum a couple of hours ago. As usual, being the charismatic and well-spoken character that he is, he made it sound like it was an &#34;Experiment&#34; and part of his master plan. And the sad part is that most of his followers are more likely to believe him. Isn&#39;t it funny how all con artists usually posses the same charismatic and well-spoken traits! 

In other words, he is admitting that he has deceived, conned and manipulated me, my radio show listeners, all the members of this group and the members of his forum for the last 5 months, and that he&#39;s done it for the good of all. I don&#39;t know about you, but to me for someone to even think of doing that, not that I believe a single word of it, but simply for thinking of such an evil scheme makes him out to be a person no better than those corrupt governments who try to deceive us. Bravo Mr. Dean Clifford! You get a 10 out of 10 for that. You have just graduated to the same level of existence as Kevin Annett! I&#39;m sure you must be very proud of yourself!

Anyway, those of you who wish to leave this group and follow in the footsteps of this new self-proclaimed savior, who plans to free all of the people of this planet with his well-calculated plan, I bid you farewell. However, if you decide to stay, then be advised that, as of this moment, Dean Clifford is considered to be in the same category as Kevin Annett and, like Kevin, he is not to be promoted on this group.

All the audio recordings, text messages and emails between Dean and I over the last 5 months will be compiled and made available to anyone who wishes to examine them. I personally believe that his announcement today was intended to make you all believe that everything he has said on those audio recordings and messages were all staged as part of his master plan. I guess he feels that he really is that smart, and that we are all that stupid in that we will believe that the reason he has not produced any of the lesson plans he has been promising for the last 5 months for the FU project, is because he was trying to prove a point. That&#39;s right Dean, I guess all those times you said on air that you are very disorganized and can&#39;t get anything done, that was all part of your master plan, right? So, does this mean that all the teachings he did on the radio show was also false and part of his set up? Of course, I expect him to make such claims. How else can he justify all that evidence on those audio files and messages? Anyway, whether you believe his claim or not is entirely up to you.

As for me, Global F.A.C.T. and FU, I think 5 months was enough time wasted on this deceiver and his accomplices. Over the last week, Dean&#39;s behavior and things he has said to me had raised a lot of red flags. I had anticipated this and hence started working on an alternative plan. FU will go forward and details will be released soon. As for the Monday show, it will now be called &#34;How To With...&#34; and there will be a new name every week.</p>

    NESARA INTERNATIONAL - DEFINITIONS YOU NEVER KNEW:
The Crown Temple - By Rule of Mystery Babylon

The Templars of the Crown - The governmental and judicial systems within the United States of America, at both federal and local state levels, is OWNED BY THE &#34;CROWN,&#34; WHICH IS A PRIVATE FOREIGN POWER.

Before jumping to conclusions about the Queen of England or the Royal Families of Britain owning the U.S.A., this is a different &#34;Crown&#34; and is fully exposed and explained below.

WE ARE SPECIFICALLY REFERENCING THE ESTABLISHED TEMPLAR CHURCH, KNOWN FOR CENTURIES BY THE WORLD AS THE &#34;CROWN.&#34; FROM THIS POINT ON, WE WILL ALSO REFER TO THE CROWN AS THE CROWN TEMPLE OR CROWN TEMPLAR, ALL THREE BEING SYNONYMOUS.

Implied or imputed in law. Opposed to actual. &#34;Legal&#34; looks more to the letter, and &#34;Lawful&#34; to the spirit, of the law. &#34;Legal&#34; is more appropriate for conformity to positive rules of law; &#34;Lawful&#34; for accord with ethical principle. &#34;Legal&#34; imports rather that the forms of law are observed, that the proceeding is correct in method, that rules prescribed have been obeyed; &#34;Lawful&#34; that the right is actful in substance, that moral quality is secured. &#34;Legal&#34; is the antithesis of &#34;equitable&#34;, and the equivalent of &#34;constructive&#34;. - 2 Abbott&#39;s Law Dict. 24; A Dictionary of Law (1893).

STATUS IN QUO, STATUS QUO. [L., state in which.] The state in which anything is already. The phrase is also used retrospectively, as when, on a treaty of place, matters return to the status quo ante bellum, or are left in statu quo ante bellum, i.e., the state (or, in the state) before the war.
-1913 Webster&#39;s Revised Unabridged Dictionary

THE FOUR INNS OF COURT TO THE UNHOLY TEMPLE

Globally, all the legalistic scams promoted by the exclusive monopoly of the Temple Bar and their Bar Association franchises come from four Inns or Temples of Court: the Inner Temple, the Middle Temple, Lincoln&#39;s Inn, and Gray&#39;s Inn.
These Inns/Temples are exclusive and private country clubs; secret societies of world power in commerce. They are well established, some having been founded in the early 1200&#39;s.

The Queen and Queen Mother of England are current members of both the Inner Temple and Middle Temple.

Gray&#39;s Inn specializes in Taxation legalities by Rule and Code for the Crown. Lincoln&#39;s Inn received its name from the Third Earl of Lincoln (circa 1300).

Just like all U.S. based franchise Bar Associations, none of the Four Inns of the Temple are incorporated - for a definite and purposeful reason: You can&#39;t make claim against a non-entity and a non-being. They are private societies without charters or statutes, and their so-called constitutions are based solely on custom and self-regulation. In other words, they exist as secret societies without a public &#34;front door&#34; unless you&#39;re a private member called to their Bar.

While the Inner Temple holds the legal system franchise by license to steal from Canada and Great Britain, it is the Middle Temple that has legal license to steal from America. This comes about directly via their Bar Association franchises to the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple through the Crown Temple.

From THE HISTORY OF THE INN, Later Centuries, [p.6], written by the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, we can see a direct tie to the Bar Association franchises and its Crown signatories in America:

&#34;Call to the Bar or keeping terms in one of the four Inns a pre-requisite to Call at King&#39;s Inns until late in the 19th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries, students came from the American colonies and from many of the West Indian islands. The Inn&#39;s records would lead one to suppose that for a time there was hardly a young gentleman in Charleston who had not studied here. Five of the signatories to the Declaration of Independence were Middle Templars, and notwithstanding it and its consequences, Americans continued to come here until the War of 1812&#34;.

All Bar Association licensed Attorneys must keep the terms of their oath to the Crown Temple in order to be accepted or &#34;called to Bar&#34; at any of the King&#39;s Inns. Their oath, pledge, and terms of allegiance are made to the Crown Temple.

It&#39;s a real eye opener to know that the Middle Inn of the Crown Temple has publicly acknowledged there were at least five Templar Bar Attornies, under solemn oath only to the Crown, who signed what was alleged to be an American Declaration of Independence. This simply means that both parties to the Declaration agreement were of the same origin, the Crown Temple. In case you don&#39;t understand the importance of this, there is no international agreement or treaty that will ever be honored, or will ever have lawful effect, when the same party signs as both the first and second parties. It&#39;s merely a worthless piece of paper with no lawful authority when both sides to any agreement are actually the same. In reality, the American Declaration of Independence was nothing more than an internal memo of the Crown Temple made among its private members.

    A recent 185 page judicial decision from the 18th September 2012 (Meads v. Meads, 2012 ABQB 571 download pdf here) concerning an acrimonious divorce in Edmonton, Canada has confirmed the inherent danger to the sustainable future of society of so called �Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Arguments� or �OPCA� proffered by acolytes and advocates of the more sophisticated and complex �Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture� to which such arguments by definition must belong.
 
While the formal 736 paragraph �Reasons for Decision� by Associate Chief Justice J.D. Rooke (&#34;Justice Rooke&#34;) is full of presumptions, suppositions, inaccuracies and gross fallacies, the document nonetheless may herald a milestone in identifying a new way in which debate and discussion concerning jurisdiction, law and procedure may unfold � specifically the admission that certain �OPCA� structures exist masquerading as legitimate argument and law, yet having no validity except by force, or as Justice Rooke states in a quote from Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan �The laws are of no power to protect them, without a sword in the hands of a man, or men, to cause those laws to be put in execution.�
 
Experience and expertise at researching OPCA
 
[1] For the past 26 years and increasingly full-time over the past fifteen years, it has been my passion and calling to research, discover and objectively reveal the full extent of the complex �Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture� established firstly by the Roman Cult, also known as the Vatican from the 11th Century in claiming the role of Vicar of Christ from the Frankish-Saxon Catholic Church and later fully developed under Henry VIII in the form of �Commonwealth law� through Westminster from the 16th Century; and
 
[2] Both forms of law still pervade the world today. Both forms of law through Papal Bulls and Acts or &#34;Statutes&#34; are based on obvious frauds and outrageously false presumptions such as the Bull Unum Sanctum (1302) which claims �all creatures are subject to the Pontiff� and the Statute of Westminster (1275) which incredibly refers to several 17th and 18th Century legal terms designed to abrogate the rights of people such as �waste�. Most importantly, both systems of pseudo-legal and pseudo-lawful argument are an anathema to the history of prior Western Law such as Carolingian (Anglo-Saxon) Law, Byzantine Law and even Roman Law which recognized the inherent and fundamental importance of consent; and
 
[3] As Justice Rooke mentions Frank O�Collins in paragraph (376) as an �OPCA Guru�, while conceding Ucadia and One-Heaven represents a �new and total code of law�, it is a matter of principle that a measured response is published, particularly in answer to a large number of gross errors and emotionally and intellectually unstable and unsupportable references throughout the judicial opinion; and
 
[4] The following prescription is provided to some of these fallacious and vexatious opinions by a wholly biased and unsuited justice in his treatment of a subject for which he appears overwhelmingly not to be an expert. 
 
Vexatious Litigation and Mala Fide (Bad Faith)
 
[5] Justice, similar to commerce, depends upon two or more parties engaging with one another to resolve a matter with mutual understanding known in �good faith�. The opposite concept to �Good Faith� is bad faith or mala fide. Blacks 9th Edition (Pg 159) defines �Bad Faith� or mala fide as �dishonesty of belief or purpose�; and
 
[6] The history of legal maxims, statute and case law concerning mala fide is well defined and clear � that a party acting with dishonest intent, or misrepresenting the facts commits an injury against the law itself � hence the most ancient Roman maxim ex dolo malo non oritur actio meaning �an action does not arise from fraud�; and
 
[7] Similarly, �Vexatious Litigation�, also known as a �Vexatious Suit� is correctly seen as an injury against the law itself with Blacks 9th Edition (Pg 1701) defines a �Vexatious Suit� as �A lawsuit instituted frivolously, or maliciously and without good grounds, meant to create trouble and expense for the party being sued�; and
 
[8] However, unlike the identification of fraudulent and wrongful action male fide (bad faith), the question of what does or does not constitute �Vexatious Litigation� is so conditional upon each specific circumstance that (to date) attempts to enforce stricter rules, codes or restrictions against perceived �Vexatious Litigants� have inevitably failed under appeal. It would be an arrogant judge indeed to ignore the weight of history and presume that what he or she may present as �Vexatious Suit� in one circumstance renders any form of partial or similar behavior equally vexatious in the future; and
 
[9] As to the specific evidence presented in the rambling 736 paragraph reasoning or Treatise (&#34;Treatise&#34;) of Justice Rooke concerning the alleged �vexatious� behaviour of one party, including evidence of male fide: a competent forum of appeal or competent jurist upon review would have to reasonably conclude that whatever �Vexatious Suit� and bad faith was demonstrated by one party in the proceeding, the action of Justice Rooke in exceeding his authority, mandate and objectivity to scribe his document outweighs any wrong doing by either litigant and renders a far greater injury against the law; and
 
Spurious, Irrelevant or Invalid documents and formalities
 
[10] Suspending for the moment the underlying theme of unquestionable jurisdiction presumed by Justice Rooke to make the wide ranging array of presumptions, errors and simplistic logical fallacies littered throughout his Treatise, it is necessary to consider the merits of specific points raised concerning the use by parties of allegedly spurious, irrelevant or invalid documents and formalities; and
 
[11] Whereas in past generations, a party to a court matter may be forgiven for the mistake of using an incorrect form or procedure, the age of the Internet affords the vast majority of the populace with virtually instant access to most standard forms and their instructions for most types of courts, especially in Western countries. In many cases, even the same judicial procedures expected to be followed by court officials is also available for instant download and review; and
 
[12] Whether or not a court is properly constituted or merely a corporate franchise masquerading as a valid court is irrelevant to the fact at hand that a competent party choosing to proceed with a matter within a certain court operated by one of the network of secretive Temple and Bar Guilds is able to not only find the proper forms accepted by the court, but also the generally accepted guidelines of such a commercial pseudo-legal entity; and
 
[13] An employee of such a pseudo-legal entity, whether a properly invested justice, or merely a private contractor under a letter of marque, has every right to disqualify documents that do not comport the internal procedures of such an entity. Justice Rooke is correct that litigants that ignore this fact risk rendering any argument fatally flawed in the face of demonstrative incompetence in the manner of how they conduct themselves through their paperwork; and
 
[14] Justice Rooke is also correct in nominating a virtual cottage industry of people �selling� and promoting their own versions of �remedy� to sometimes desperate and gullible people, especially in being convinced that absurd and idiotic corruption of grammar and punctuation somehow renders a superior position as in the case of one highly discredited �remedy guru�. Similarly, there are many other people promoting their own versions of documents through seminars and web sites with the promise of instant success; and
 
[15] As to the validity of the content contained within such documents, Justice Rooke has gravely erred and is in gross error in seeking to comment and adjudicate the merits of the content. It should have been enough for any Justice to summarize that such documents tendered to the court as per the exhibits within the Treatise do not confirm to proper procedure, were spurious and irrelevant and therefore put to rest. For Justice Rooke then assumed the position of historian, theologian and philosopher and proceeded to adjudicate the validity of the content is quite extraordinary and now demands clear debate and honest answers to a number of the topics raised.
 
Cestui Que Vie Trusts and Annuities
 
[16] In several places within his Treatise, Justice Rooke seeks to ridicule those who may question the existence of a type of trust in their name called a &#34;Cestui Que Vie&#34; Trust and its intimate connection to the Birth Certificate; and
 
[17] While refusing to admit to the existence of such a trust in the name of the litigant in the case, a reasonable person could be led to conclude by the words of Justice Rooke that such claims of the existence of a Cestui Que Vie Trust in the name of each citizen of Canada as in other Commonwealth and western countries is mere mythology and evidence of mental illness; and
 
[18] In fact, the existence of Cestui Que Vie Trusts and their fundamental importance to the present global accounting system of Western-Roman States is without question. The Cestui Que Vie Act of 1666 and of 1707 remain largely in force even today. The reason for these acts? To create the legal fiction necessary that declares if a person is considered lost at sea, abandoned, dead, a lunatic, a minor or incompetent then not only may their property be held in guardianship, but that a contract may be established called an &#34;annuity&#34; whereby a value may be granted to the guardian or custodian by the purchaser of the contract in exchange for some form of ongoing income derived from maximising the value of the estate of the infant, lunatic, lost or &#34;dead&#34; person. The result is the birth of annuities through such acts of parliament as Life Annuities in 1703 which helped fund the ongoing wars of Great Britain and subsequent acts such as the 28 million pounds from annuities act of 1801 which created an even larger annuity system; and
 
[19] The existence of annuities created against the name of citizens of Western-Roman States, particularly former or present Commonwealth countries is unquestionable. One of the first key acts of US Congress was to establish a system for the repayment of public debt through the selling of shares and annuities through the 1790 Public Debt Act. Virtually every country has its own annuity public statutes, such as Canada and these can be found by searching the public databases. In each and every case, annuities depend upon the existence of Cestui Que Vie Trusts. So who is said to administer Cestui Que Vie Trusts in most Commonwealth countries? The Queen&#39;s Bench of the High Court!; and
 
[20] Here we find that either Justice Rooke is attempting to pervert the course of justice in deliberately obfuscating the fact that he does possess a genuine fiduciary duty to administer the very trust to which the litigant refers, but for some unknown explanation is unwilling or unable to do so; or Justice Rooke and the entire Queen&#39;s Bench is wholly incompetent and such fiduciary obligations are no longer being met. In either case, the Treatise of Justice Rooke has opened up more questions than it has answered; and
 
[21] Fiat justitia ruat caelum (let justice be done though the heavens fall) is not merely one of the oldest and most important maxims for all Judges and Magistrates, it is expected by the public that a judge render his or her verdict and reasoning impartially and without supposition as to whether an accused found guilty is a �good or evil man or woman� in the eyes of the Universe. Any judge that willingly and deliberately exceeds such maxim does so at peril to Justice in that realm and on the face of the Treatise of Justice Rooke, it appears strongly that fair justice is indeed under threat in Canada; and
 
The illegitimacy of using Fallacy to define argument
 
[22] The most forbidden act for a Judge or Magistrate to use when addressing the law, is the use of �fallacy�, sometimes also written as �logical fallacy�. This is because for more than two thousand three hundred years (since the time of Plato and Aristotle) it remains a steadfast truth of any competent forum that when one or more fallacies are found to exist in any legal argument, especially one associated with a verdict then logically the whole argument itself may be discredited, derogated or abrogated; and
 
[23] A classic example of how arguments based on fallacy are forbidden in legitimate and valid forums of justice (as opposed to pseudo-legal commercial places masquerading as courts) is a false argument such as a classic non-sequitur (a) �A red haired man killed a policeman� therefore (b) �All red haired men are killers� or (c ) �Red haired men only kill police�. To a man or woman of sound mind and reason, such an argument is obviously flawed and untrue and injurious to the law; and
 
[24] A separate example of logical fallacy is �argumentum ad hominem� whereby an argument is constructed upon false and untested presumptions of character in order to validate an argument. It is why competent judicial systems normally forbid their Judges and officials from making or writing argumentum ad hominem fallacies concerning the mind of an accused until such facts are properly tested and can be rightly deduced; and
 
[25] It is with great regret that the government and judiciary of Canada have permitted the release a document evidencing not one, or two specific paragraphs demonstrating non-sequiturs and ad hominems, but literally dozen upon dozen paragraphs filled with formal and logical fallacies of such number that it is impossible at this time to reference them all within the brief of this reply. This might be something a competent and reasonable reader of the Treatise of Justice Rooke may choose to do at their leisure; and
 
[26] On every possible grounds of judicial competence, the treatise of Justice Rooke should be immediately withdrawn. Certainly, if the Inner and Middle Temple themselves were disinclined to act against such an obvious injury to the credibility of any future judgments emanating from the Queens Bench in Canada, then one could reasonably conclude the rot within the legal profession is terminal.
 
The invalidity of circular arguments as logical proof
 
[27] A further example of fallacy (logical fallacy) littering the Treatise of Justice Rooke is the fallacy of circular thinking, also known as circular logic. Because of how prevalent this particular logical fallacy exists within the treatise of Justice Rooke, the demonstration of such incompetent reasoning requires particular mention; and
 
[28] A classic example of logical fallacy that all readers would be familiar is �because I said so�, as a time honored answer offered frequently by parents and teachers when cornered on a challenge of jurisdiction, order, instruction of explanation. Continuing the analogy, such a fallacy of circular thinking is usually backed up if challenged by some demonstration of enforcement of jurisdiction. As evidenced by the quote of Hobbes mentioned by Justice Rooke in the opening of his treatise, it appears a similar flawed thinking exists; and
 
[29] �Might is right� may have been argued by President Lincoln, but it is inarguable as Rule of Law. Before the study of Lord Blackstone�s Commentaries on the Laws of England was eventually abandoned to less rigorous education of young legal minds, most first year graduates of law school much less a senior Judge should know that authority of law is ultimately derived from consent of the people. Anything else is merely a decree without legitimacy; and
 
[30] In a just system, there exists no separate form of law for judges versus litigants. A man who is asked to give consent to testifying under oath in a presumed court of law has every right to ask as a matter of principle that all those who shall administer such an oath and speak for or against such testimony are equally enrolled and bound. The several circular fallacies referenced by Justice Rooke to this point are manifestly inadequate and an example of either extraordinary contempt for fundamental principles of law, or an attempt to obfuscate some other factors contributing to the result that in practice a judge does operate under separate form of law; and
 
[31] A similar array of flawed and inadequate circular fallacies were offered up by Justice Rooke as to the question of jurisdiction and authority of a court, especially by what form(s) of law it may or may not function. Such questions when done as a matter of respect are absolutely fundamental to the fairness of law. To dismiss such points through the use of circular arguments akin to �because I said so� is an open mockery to the rights of fair hearing, justice and to be heard for any litigant or party before any court in Canada, the United States, Australia and any other jurisdiction enjoyned to the Treatise of Justice Rooke. 
 
The Danger of Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Arguments
 
[32] Justice Rooke of Canada is indeed correct on one point: �Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Arguments� and those that propagate them are a danger to Justice, the law and civilization in general. As we have just outlined clearly and methodically, we are indeed dealing with an extremely dangerous, spurious, illegitimate instrument in the matter of the Treatise of Justice Rooke himself that threatens the very Rule of Law and Justice in Canada and potentially wider if further propagated; and
 
[33] The Canons of Law also known as Astrum Iuris Divini Canonum defined through the Society of One Heaven as mentioned by Justice Rooke in paragraph (376) define Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture under Article 163 of Canons of Sovereign Law being:
 
Canon 6652
 
Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture (OPCA) is a universally recognized description and acronym to define a comprehensive commercial system of law, statutes, offices, administration, history, enforcement based on fraud, false presumptions and repudiation of time honored principles of Divine Law, Natural Law, Positive Law and Rule of Law. The first �OPCA� Architecture ever invented was the Commonwealth Law Form from the time of Henry VIII of England in the 16th Century CE.
 
Canon 6653
 
It is universally accepted by all competent jurists and philosophers that a system must contain the following elements to be validly defined as a Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture (OPCA) being an Area, Army, Assembly and Administration of one or more Agencies
 
(i) An Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Area, also known as a �country� or �nation� is the appearance of a valid kingdom or constituted dominion under some instrument of constitution, when it is in fact merely a franchise of a larger pseudo-religious commercial network such as the Roman Cult having no legitimacy whatsoever; and
 
(ii) An Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Army, also known as a �police force� or �sheriff force� is a body appearing to maintain law and order which is instead used to enforce the narrow policies of commercial self interest of a few controlling the OPCA architecture; and
 
(iii) An Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Assembly, also known as a �parliament� is a body possessing the appearances of validity consent, in the issuing of acts, but which repudiates and rejects the need for consent of the people instead treating with contempt its own laws in order to maintain commercial advantage and power at any cost; and
 
(iv) An Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Administration and Agencies such as the Private Bar Guilds pretending to be legitimate courts when such franchises are frequently mere registered corporations run by Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Acolytes masquerading as justices and officials.
 
Canon 6654
 
The Traits of OPCA Architecture have been rooted in the indicium (signs) of legitimacy since the 16th Century, while promoting rituals and administrative procedures that have no basis in law or history other than to profor commercial advantage to the Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Acolytes. These fraudulent signs are highest in use within the private courts operated for profit by the Private Bar Guilds mostly since the 19th Century falsely pretending to respect and protect the law and uphold the ancient maxims of law in accordance with these Canons, including but not limited to:
 
(i) The adoption of robes and dress that have more association with wizardry, occult worship of Ba�al as Galli attendants than any legitimate mandate of jurisprudence; and
 
(ii)The adoption of language, the use of upper and lower case to denote corporate fictions and estates from trusts and other associated elements; and
 
(iii) The use of terms stolen from sacred law such as �session�, �honorable� while judges in many jurisdictions no longer take proper oaths, nor feel compelled to do so, or justify such behaviour; and
 
(iv) The heavy use of nautical and maritime terms in association with admiralty law, yet with no interest in honoring the limited remedy made available through such corrupt law.
 
Canon 6655
 
An Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Acolyte, also known is one thoroughly immersed and satisfied with the architecture of Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture who displays the general characteristics of arrogance, contempt for history and rule of law, a blasphemous rejection of the significance of Divine Law and is willing to defend the system to the end, without any desire to comprehend its provenance or function. The strongest exemplars of such cultish and fanatical behaviour remains the deliberately corrupted academic system of Western nations from the 20th Century and the insular courts systems of Western nations operated by the Private Bar Guilds.
 
Canon 6656
 
The misrepresentation, misnaming or misconstruing of the term Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture (OPCA) is an indication of deliberate fraud, ignorance, incompetence or a combination of all these factors.
 
Canon 6657
 
Any argument claiming the present canons reflect in any way a Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture (OPCA) is hereby false, a repudiation of all form of logic and sense and therefore an open confession that the proponent of such a claim is suffering severe mental illness and unfit to hold any form of office.
 
Conclusion
 
Clearly, there exists an existential threat to Justice and the Rule of Law in Canada, the United States and Australia and it is from rogue Judges and Magistrates who now openly seek to declare war against sections of the population and to ignore basic principles of judicial competency.
 
The question is whether we will see a reprieve or a continuation of the rapid decline of basic competence in all fundamental branches of government? Time will tell.

    THAHOKETOTEH.WS � &gt;&gt; ROYAL BLOODLINE

The   American colonial states (Canada and the U.S.) have always been governed by the bloodline. There is actually 13 bloodlines that trace back to King Nimrod of Babylon.

This is the �Annunaki� bloodline or more commonly known as the Illuminati.

Through legalese the U.S. Constitution is actually wrote to insure this bloodline remains above the law. Interesting that the original Flag had 13 stars 13star flag One for each family.

This same bloodline is responsible for all of the wars in the past and are the only obstacle to Peace on earth. The American revolution was really the Masonic takeover of  Iroquois land.

    from Corby Weaver&#39;s notes: (just a thought to share here)
The government states that the Constitution is a grant of power and that is correct, but to perform corporate functions, which is the Office of Profit, everyone misses the Key words in the document like &#34;office of Trust&#34; along with that office of profit. No one seems to see it, as if it is invisible and has no meaning, but IT is the creator. They also miss the words about the jury trial and words of &#34;common law&#34;. No one invokes the common law because the laws established under the 14th amendment are not common law, but they cannot be in conflict with it, and they aren&#39;t. People do not know who they are and where they came from, why they are here, and where their Rights come from. The Amendments are a restatement of rights but under the 14th amendment they are ONLY a codicil that changes the intentions of the founding fathers. Thus Civil Rights.

To invoke the common law one must ask the administrators which office they represent (office of trust or office of profit), inform them they are trustees of the trust you are a beneficiary/legatee/heir of, tell them where the Trust resides, inform them that Rights do not devolve through an office of profit, that they would be in breach of trust if they continue to follow their proceedings as is, and that as an Heir you are invoking the Common Law of England as it stands in this country.

Under Constitutional Law a court � ANY court, MUST look toward the Trust first and make determinations from that point, not statutory law.

    Just wondering, if you are charge with a &#34;crime&#34; that is statutory in nature, why don&#39;t you bring a charge against the police or crown in their court, that&#39;s what it&#39;s there for, employees of the government.  For example, someone on this page had said that their family and or witnesses were not allowed in court. At that point why would you go to see the Justice of the peace and lay a charge of obstruction.  At a court hearing I was at, a buddy who has some knowledge of this type of stuff got into an argument with the crown, both in and outside of the court room.  He went to the JP and had a peace bond taken out against the crown, simple!  Of course there was no financial compensation at that point, but it is using their words (criminal code) against them, like the do to us!  Simple or not?  I am considering charging the crown with conspiracy in my case, they have CONspired with the police to do harm to me.  Just putting it out there! Any comments?

    The ASSUMED JURISDICTION- thread!

The Dictionary of Canadian Law, 3rd-edition- ASSUMED JURISDICTION: 

There are two sources from which the Court of Queen&#39;s Bench in Saskatchewan acquires jurisdiction over an IN PERSONAM action. The first is the COMMON LAW which provides that this Court has jurisdiction where there is service of the process within the province. The second, is what is frequently called &#34;ASSUMED JURISDICTION,&#34; which is a CREATION OF LEGISLATION. It empowers a court to assume jurisdiction over a cause of action which arose in this province despite the fact that the defendant&#39;s residence is elsewhere and the process must be served EX JURIS. This new jurisdiction was introduced in England by The COMMON LAW PROCEDURE ACT, 1852 (i wonder if THAT is still around?) That same jurisdiction was incorporated into the law of Saskatchewan by the enactment of s.12 of The Queen&#39;s Bench Act. Gray v. Dow Corning Corp. (1996)

LEX CONVENTIONALIS: [L. conventional law] The law which the PARTIES AGREE is to GOVERN. (this Maxim is NOT in Black&#39;s Law Dictionary, by the way)

LEX CAUSAE: The law governing an issue according to the CHOICE of law rules.

LEX EST DICTAMEN RATIONIS: Law is the pronouncement of reason.
