      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A friend asked me to write something about this, so I figured what better place to write about taxation than in this group.&#xA;What is taxation? If you use the property, isn&amp;rsquo;t it fair to pay for the usage? How can this be theft? I hope to answer these questions in the body here and in the comments if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, you have to understand that when your parents filled out an application for a Birth Certificate, the government has to reorganize itself to account for a new organization on its books. The government has both a liability to the organization and the organization has duties owed to the government. The government borrows against the future duties in order to fulfill its obligations. Wait, what did I just say? It borrows against the future of an organization to fulfill its&amp;rsquo; duties to the organization. Yes, it saddles the organization with debt to fulfill its debt. Currently, the National Debt of the United States is almost $20 trillion. (Which shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a thing here in reality, but it is) The government is borrowing using private banks as brokers against this organizations&amp;rsquo; future which represents you. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take a mathematician to see the fraudulent nature of this. Of course if there was disclosure, there would be no fraud, but did any of you ever get disclosure on this? I didn&amp;rsquo;t think so&amp;hellip;..anyway&amp;hellip;.. Because there is debt in transit, which is money, a security must be issued. This security is a Bill of Lading. While the cargo is in your possession, you are liable for it. The cargo is debt. (Unfortunately, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a simpler way to communicate this)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
