      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A friend asked me to write something about this, so I figured what better place to write about taxation than in this group.&#xA;What is taxation? If you use the property, isn&amp;rsquo;t it fair to pay for the usage? How can this be theft? I hope to answer these questions in the body here and in the comments if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, you have to understand that when your parents filled out an application for a Birth Certificate, the government has to reorganize itself to account for a new organization on its books. The government has both a liability to the organization and the organization has duties owed to the government. The government borrows against the future duties in order to fulfill its obligations. Wait, what did I just say? It borrows against the future of an organization to fulfill its&amp;rsquo; duties to the organization. Yes, it saddles the organization with debt to fulfill its debt. Currently, the National Debt of the United States is almost $20 trillion. (Which shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a thing here in reality, but it is) The government is borrowing using private banks as brokers against this organizations&amp;rsquo; future which represents you. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take a mathematician to see the fraudulent nature of this. Of course if there was disclosure, there would be no fraud, but did any of you ever get disclosure on this? I didn&amp;rsquo;t think so&amp;hellip;..anyway&amp;hellip;.. Because there is debt in transit, which is money, a security must be issued. This security is a Bill of Lading. While the cargo is in your possession, you are liable for it. The cargo is debt. (Unfortunately, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a simpler way to communicate this)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE TENDER FOR LAW – LIVE EXAMPLE #001 – PROPER NOTICE FOR IDIOTS (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.&#xA;TONIGHT’S TOPIC: PROPER NOTICE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In one of the many ongoing AQUILAE initiatives, I have cause to produce a NOTICE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I’m using THE TENDER FOR LAW as a notebook for my students, I figure I might as well “kill two birds with one stone” by discussing the aspects of NOTICE here, more specifically PROPER NOTICE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Originally posted on Facebook, Tuesday May 3, 2016]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have you read Aldous Huxley&amp;rsquo;s Brave New World (1932),  George Orwell&amp;rsquo;s Animal Farm (1945) and Nineteen Eighty Four (1949) , Ray Bradbury&amp;rsquo;s Fahrenheit 451 (1953), or seen the movies,  Brazil (1985) and Idiocracy (2006)?    What about books by Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov,  Alfred Bester,  Arthur C. Clarke,  Philip K. Dick,  William Gibson,  Frank Herbert, Robert A. Heinlein,  Larry Niven,  Jerry Pournelle,  Jules Verne, H. G. Wells?   Some of you have.   It&amp;rsquo;s likely your children have not.  We have to protect our children from independent thought,  wherever possible - or so I&amp;rsquo;m told.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
