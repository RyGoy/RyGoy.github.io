      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ive been hinting at something in here for months, so now I will go into detail using a totally metaphorical and totally not real example. üòÅ&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you are 18 and you are smarter than the rest of your high school buddies, so you opt to go to trade school rather than college. This is a GOOD DECISION! You figure that you can work as an apprentice during the day to collect your hours and go to school at night to satisfy the classroom requirements for the license that you hope to earn (yes, this is hilarious). Does everyone know how this very simple mechanism works? &amp;hellip;.good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After very little investigation, you are forced to accept the realization that you are not a PERSON, rather you HAVE a PERSON. This distinction is the first ‚Äúlie of ommission‚Äù that you will encounter in the world of the ‚ÄúLEGAL‚Äù. THE TENDER FOR LAW axiom ‚ÄúLEGAL=SURETY AND ACCOUNTING‚Äù makes navigating ‚Äúlaw‚Äù a lot simpler, and it‚Äôs very easy to spot the lies of ommission/ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It‚Äôs the ultimate artificial person.  To understand what this means you should refer to my earlier articles.  The Criminal Code of Canada states, inter alia [Source R.S., c. C-34, s. 2 ‚ÄúINTERPRETATION‚Äù]:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;‚Äúevery one‚Äù, ‚Äúperson‚Äù and ‚Äúowner‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;¬´ quiconque ¬ª, ¬´ individu ¬ª, ¬´ personne ¬ª et ¬´ propri√©taire ¬ª&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While embracing my love of ignorance &lt;strong&gt;I COULD NOT SEE&lt;/strong&gt; how this &lt;strong&gt;ABSTRACTION&lt;/strong&gt; was being used against me every day or how I could use it for my benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
