    STEALTH THEIST EXPOSED!

Ok, here&#39;s the thing; IF YOU &#34;FRIEND&#34; ME AND I ACCEPT, IT IS BECAUSE:

1) YOU ARE FEMALE
2) You want the experience of talking to a man who won&#39;t lie to you.
3) I might want to have sex with you on a later date.

OTHERWISE you can just read what&#39;s here.

Edna can now do neither

You see, when you &#34;friend&#34; me and I accept, I get all the crap you post on your timeline in MY newsfeed. If you don&#39;t like truth DON&#39;T FRIEND ME!

If you don&#39;t want me to comment on your timeline DON&#39;T FRIEND ME.

And as a special subnote: To the other idiot cunt who implied that I &#34;enjoy&#34; being the nobility - Suck my cock you uninformed ignorant cunt. I am the anti Christ, because &#34;christ&#34; is OUR invention, and the fact that I was born into it was NOT something I chose. Have all the delusions you like. Support the evil of the Noble lie, but don&#39;t EVER say I enjoy and/or support the nobility and its dogma. That&#39;s YOUR job.

...please continue to choke on my cock.

Happy Blasphemy day people!

    The formation of the Universal Postal Union in 1874 has another legal effect that is very important to the Universal-Legal-Technology. The Universal Postal Union unites member countries into a single, worldwide postal territory. 13[13] We have already learned that any litigant is going into international jurisdiction every time he goes to any court. Since the litigant needs to establish that his papers are official, he uses a dollar???? postage stamp on the face of the first page. The stamps also invoke postal statutes and the Universal Postal Union jurisdiction. Currently in the U. S., the stamp of choice is the �fox� (discontinued 22 April 2004 or earlier) U. S. dollar postage stamp. The stamp is not drawn in a box, making the forty-five-degree lines unnecessary. The litigant does, however, need to autograph across the stamp, then date the autograph, for two reasons: to comply with postal regulations concerning private mail carriers, and to make a continuance of evidence that the process (paper work) is mail. The continuation of evidence is less of a factor, since the definitions of �mail� and �delivery� can include a clerk at a grocery store handing a customer a receipt for groceries. One can see that Standaring had his shipping clerk wired with the Bill of Lading. 

The legal writers were forced to make the definitions wide enough to encompass the private rural carriers, and private advertisers that have placed advertisements on our doorsteps, or in our hands. I have thought about this issue a lot, and I did not find any other better alternative. Any loophole would have devastated many consumers, and caused a plethora of other laws to be enacted to cover the loophole. 

Additionally, on the back of the first page, we authenticate the authority of the Post-Office with an endorsement, and simultaneously authenticate our identity by placing a postage meter stamp, from a postage meter machine that we have purchased in advance, on the lower quarter of the back of the first page. All commercial papers have endorsements to authenticate their authenticity. Again, we autograph across the meter stamp, and date. The postage meter stamp is better than a regular stamp, and stamps are said to have rendered seals superfluous. 14[14] The purchase of a meter machine requires identification in case the meter machine is tampered with or is stolen. The meter number on the meter stamp can be traced back to the owner (litigant), and therefore authenticates the endorser better than any seal. 
  Scott Duncan-Is this what makes the &#34;Buck-O-5&#34; Method so powerful???? Please insert your Opinion on the Mythical to me- Process!!!!!! Excelsior!

    Seriously. Why do I waste my time?

The guy who was banned for declaring this group &#34;dishonest&#34;, messages me privately.

Why do these bitches always accuse me of &#34;cowardice&#34;? There is no &#34;fear&#34;. Only contempt.

Somebody Post the Dean Kory Crap in the comments...

Let&#39;s start carving the bullshit up into smaller pieces so EVERYONE KNOWS FOR SURE, that I am doing EXACTLY the right thing by banning them.

    Valuing the right thing... Not being in Jail...

The ability to Mind my own business through a Private TRUST.
      Walk away from a traffic/harassment stop with at least 2 warrants for arrest out at present, for bullshit. 
      Me was pulled over in SERENITY in the seedy part of town, looking for weed and hookers.
       Cop comes up to SERENITY, I read him my public notice about the Name Jason Fredrick Leblanc being TRUST Property, he cuts me off... doesn&#39;t let me finish... asks for insurance and registration which I do have... Under a separate TRUST agreement... He takes documents to Police cruiser, I write up invoice for unauthorized use of name... cop comes back with 2 tickets made out to the vehicles registered title holder... which will be new originaled and voided.... for failure to produce licence... 
     I try to hand him my invoice he sticks tickets in my hand...
     MY Phone and I did not get along ( battery was dead, car charger has issues, managed to catch last minute or so)... only caught the officer calling me by the Name on the ticket and handing me the tickets ( I will email vid to Scott, tech difficulties on this end, for verification and to post here if it is acceptable)... 
He did not use my name...
     The Cop attached surety to a person not even present at the time ( separate trust). He avoided the use of the name and made a point of calling me a different name.. I did not correct him as I knew I could New Original and VOID.
     I do not like the special beatings...
     What I did not know was the amount of officers present....
     As the cop turned off his emergency lights and drove away ... it was a parade... 3 paddy wagons.. 3 marked cop cars, a unmarked SUV and 2 more unmarked cars pulled out after him...

I did not let them attach attach surety to me... 
from what I have learned here... 
drove away and scored some weed...
Having tech issues with vid... have sent raw footage by email.
Jay.

    Has anyone ever heard of this Robert Michael of the House of Marques, who claims to represent the &#39;Chair of Saint Peter?&#39; It&#39;s only a 10 minute audio along with the transcript to it, in regards to the bankruptcy of Detroit. At first i thought this was going to be some sort of &#39;OPPT&#39; related-thing, then there was the quackery i thought this would involve regarding the Bible/God/Jesus with some guy claiming to represent the Chair of Saint Peter- whatever that is...but at the end of it- the Judge pretty much tells everybody- &#34;Listen up!...this guy is really onto something here&#34;

Is he onto something here?

    Just got an email informing me that the Venus project is still going hard and has a new website including a forum - I took a peek, looks pretty good to me!

THE VENUS PROJECT&#39;S NEW WEBSITE

We are very happy to present our new website. Included are many new photos, multiple News items on the home page (e.g. BBC slideshow of The Venus Project narrated by Jacque Fresco), TVP Education, and TVP TV. Get Involved with our Current Projects as a Supporter, a Volunteer, or take our Mentor classes. Everything has been updated; Archives, book and documentary lists, Viral Images, FAQ, Current State of Technology, and more. How wonderful that this was all accomplished though our network of volunteers who work tirelessly to inform others of The Venus Project, a sustainable alternative to our present conditions of politics, poverty and war.

          <p>The Venus Project calls for a redesign of our culture in which war, poverty, hunger and unnecessary human suffering are viewed not only as avoidable, but as totally unacceptable.</p>

    To put a dash of serious humor on the topic, an old Patriot friend of mine told me he&#39;d carry NO identification and when asked for ID by a cop he&#39;d reply, &#34;You&#39;re looking at it&#34; &#34;Why, you can&#39;t identify me&#34;? &#34;What is a piece of paper gonna do for identifying me when you are looking at the real McCoy?&#34;

  <div class="py-4 whitespace-pre-line">
    The word �person� in legal terminology is perceived as a general word which normally includes in its scope a variety of entities other than human beings. Seee.g. 1 U.S.C. sec 1. Church of Scientology v. U.S. Dept. of Justice (1979) 612F.2d 417, 425.

One of the very first of your state statutes will have a section listed entitled �Definitions. �Carefully study this section of the statutes and you will find a portion that reads similar to this excerpt:

In construing these statutes and each and every word, phrase, or part hereof, where the context will permit:

(1) The singular includes the plural and vice versa.

(2) Gender-specific language includes the other gender and neuter.

(3) The word �person� includes individuals, children, firms, associations, joint adventures, partnerships, estates, trusts, business trusts, syndicates, fiduciaries, corporations, and all other groups or combinations.

NOTE HOWEVER, THE DEFINITIONS STATUTE DOES NOT LIST MAN OR WOMAN � THEREFORE THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM ALL THE STATUTES !!!

    QUOTES ~ President Woodrow Wilson made regarding his decision allowing the Federal Reserve to exist.
A) (6 years after he signed into law the Federal Reserve act) �I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is now controlled by its system of credit. We are no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.
B) �A little group of willful men, representing no opinion but their own, have rendered the government of the US helpless.�
C) �If there are men in this country big enough to own the government of the United States, they are going to own it.�
D) �If monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of government. I do not expect monopoly to restrain itself.�

See a copy of a report on the federal Reserve: 
 Modern Money Mechanics Report on the Federal Reserve 
See the accompanying Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkehQ19dDKA
Also see these reports: http://cafr1.com/everwonder.html
 

�If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless in the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.� ~ Thomas Jefferson

    So Scott, you said to set things up as these &#34;countries&#34; have set things up. Then I would understand that CANADA is the corporation that HOLDS ASSETS and does not operate in commerce? The gov&#39;t is a TRUST which handles commerce on behalf of CANADA? 

Then all corporations / persons registered within that TRUST are PROPERTY of that TRUST and all commerce done therein are interest of this TRUST?

I am trying to figure out which entity acts in commerce on behalf of all. It is my understanding that an entity that HOLDS assets should not be involved in commerce at all.

My question being, do I have it all backwards? Would not the registered entity be the one involved in commerce and the TRUST does not?

    Problem-

Here in Denmark the registry for liens/claims is very difficult. Its run by the courts. 

To register a lien they charge you 1.5% of the lien value. Making it only possible to lien someone 

a) if you got a bunch of cash or 

b) can somehow convince a court to judge in favour of your private administrative process default....

Solution for debate-

As the lien and the consequential bad credit rating/report is really the only thing that will in most cases grab your adversaries attention and force him to negotiate. 

And given my present situation with the Danish registry I was thinking seeing as though commerce is international and my admin process specifically invokes international contract law/admiralty that I could simply register my claims online in my country of origin (Australia) where it&#39;s easier and costs virtually nothing. 

Then with that registry receipt  then inform/report the claim/debt to DNB and a bunch of other credit bureaus, then check back to see if my adversary still wants to hold out or negotiate a mutual release of lien ect...

    Just thinkin  out Loud.   If we own Nothing,Certificate of Title, Deed, etc, who holds the True Title(NOT the Property) is the Owner of the Thing!!! And we just pay for the UPkeep via Sweat Equity/Life Energy. So the BC is the Real Thing in this instance, and we through Ignorance Pledge for it! Is this the 1st Foundational thing to do is Lien the BC, to Control it, like a Gate Keeper!? Just seeking Eye Salve!!!;)

    hey Scott, any thoughts on the new supreme court judge Marc Nadon that has been chosen to the surprise of many. Do you think it&#39;s part of a &#39;secret agenda like many people are saying? I&#39;m not so sure frankly, but then again he&#39;s a surprise choice. And a lawyer is taking him to task saying that he should not be there.

    I can&#39;t find the thread where we were coming up with reasons the commonwealth died, but I had a thought  and will post it here. 

At the kyoto protocol talks, there were also talks about the Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST). I quote this from a different article on LOST... &#34;In order to protect and govern this common heritage, the Treaty creates what is in effect a new world government � a government of the sea. &#34; http://www.masterresource.org/2013/04/lost-treaty-walk-plank/

IF the definition of Canada Canadian waters&#39;&#39; includes the territorial sea of Canada and the internal waters of Canada;(interpretations act), would this be why the commonwealth was dead...as most are defined as water so they would have to abide by this new world government created from LOST?

    Small victory, is no victory at all. This judgement is nothing but smoke. Sure she won the case but for what reasons. I believe this is the justice system doling out a small victory for the sake of looking good. Had this not made the media she would be in jail.

The judge rejected the charter arguments, but said that Tobias&#39;s memory and some conflicting testimony left him with reasonable doubt as to her intent at the time of the refusal.

Tobias&#39;s lawyer, Peter Rosenthal, had argued that forcing her to complete the census would violate her freedoms of conscience and free expression.

&#34;He described our charter arguments as Hail Mary passes and he didn&#39;t catch it ...They were novel arguments but he found a more novel argument it seems in analyzing the [intent].&#34;

This shit get my goat. The Lawyer and Justice are aligned by oath, the simple remedy was to invoke 794.2 and 15 of the C.C.C. Giving the mam lawful excuse. A judge would have provided remedy but there are no judges anymore. Just smoke and mirrors.

  <div class="py-4 whitespace-pre-line">
    A friend has a situation where he rents a room in a home. The other tenant whose name is on the lease was told in court that my friend is ordered to move out of the home. There was nothing given in writing to any parties related to the order. My friend was told by the other tenant about the order (would that be hearsay?) . Apparently the order said he must be out today and stay away for 6 months. 

For this order to be valid, should he not receive it in writing as opposed to hearing it from a 3rd party? If there is nothing in writing how would he be able to rebut the offer made by the court? My thoughts are that the administrative process would be a valuable tool for him to use, but he has nothing but hearsay to respond to. 

I appreciate any feedback :)

    This Drivers License seems to be causing this Person CHRISTOPHER EVAN SCHULTE a good deal of administrative work.  Is the lack of another signature evidence for a PERFECTED CLAIM?  Can i go straight to a lien on the account making me Creditor?

    I get it Scott, Pooh-bah lies by omission by keeping you believing you are NOT ENTITLED/AUTHORITAH... Rather, keeping the focus on the Clubhouse Rules and following them instead of seeing THROUGH them. Which is what the Liars do...

As there may be much validity to examining the Clubhouse Rules, it is the underlying LOGICAL REALITY derived from these &#34;rules of massacre&#34; where you will SEE the truth.

This only goes to show how much we have learned how to LEARN...

And... Shakespeare sucks. You almost need to study HOW to read that shit.

Thank you, Scott

    What&#39;s with the chick posts?  

I&#39;m reading through a number of things people have deemed worthy of putting into print, and frankly I&#39;m amazed at how little has been learned.

These posts all have a commonality that, loosely translated, sounds like, &#34;I know a guy that knows a guy...no names...and this guy has a problem.  I&#39;m not going to provide much detail because anyone who is really anyone should be able to read between the lines and KNOW what I&#39;m trying to say.&#34; 

These posts continue by providing exactly no relevant information that would describe the problem or the circumstances that brought the problem into existence; but they are asking for your assistance in solving it - in some equally undefined way.  At least that&#39;s the impression I get as few people seem to be able to articulate a desired result.

This to me seems like &#34;chick speak.&#34;  The conversation all men (and some women) have had where the requester (yep, a chick) says there is a problem that you should innately comprehend, because &#34;if you don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not going to tell you.&#34;

If you are inviting conversation or advice you should provide the nature of the problem or event, the circumstances leading to the issue, and the desired result.  It should not take 50-100 comments by well-meaning, but also equally confused strangers, to get to even a semblance of the facts.

If you don&#39;t have the facts, don&#39;t post your idiot problem.  If you are viewing the idiot problem, don&#39;t spend your valuable time playing I-Spy with the original poster.  I don&#39;t care how much you love the poster.  I don&#39;t care whether you think the poster has intellectual superpowers or should be held in high regard.

For here&#39;s the thing.  In the Emperor&#39;s new clothedness of things, if you respond to a post with your oh-so-pointless advice (for how could it be otherwise if you don&#39;t know the nature of the problem), you have become an enabler.  You are lending your credibility, however insignificant, to the mix.  In this universe significant interest equals significant relevance.  Do you see how this works?

People love a problem.  It has become popular to entice others to ask a ridiculous number of questions to draw out the information.  But at what cost?

If you are the original poster, get your facts down.  If you can&#39;t write in real sentences, use point form.  

Why are you seeking advice?
What, specifically, is the problem?
What, briefly, led to the issue.
How has the issue manifested, and what are the negative ramifications?
What is the desired result?

Here&#39;s an example:

I will be departing on a cross-country hitchhiking adventure in two weeks and I have damaged my primary thumb.
I hit it with a hammer while I was putting up a nail to hang a picture.  There is soft tissue damage, and some mild bleeding, but no permanent damage.
Currently my thumb is bleeding and swelling which will negatively impact my ability to get a ride.
What is the most effective way to treat the injury so I can pursue my dream?

In this particular scenario the advice may encompass some probing questions about why you need to go on a hitchhiking adventure, what your goals are, or whether it might be preferable to take a bus.  But at least there is something specific for people to comment on. 

Are you here to learn how to think, or are you so eager for emotional support that you&#39;ll compel other equally unfulfilled people to feed your chick-shit shortcomings?  There are soap operas and therapy sessions for that.  At least if you pursue this option people will know you are just there to vent, and will not be enticed into trying to solve your unsolvable questions.

Think or shut the fuck up!  I hope that&#39;s clear enough. If it isn&#39;t, go whine to your therapist... or the girls from Sex and the City.

...idiots.

    Hey everyone, this is a new payroll/paycheck thread. First I would like to say that the deductions from my check make me furious. Every week over a thousand dollars is deducted for Federal tax, this makes me crazy as I know this money is being used to destroy the family unit and the good men and women of this nation. 

THIS MUST STOP, I have no intent, no matter how bad things get to collect the benefits of E.I. nor CPP. 

I have sent proper notice to the Commish of Revenue Canada, they went silent and stopped sending remittances and demands. As a matter of course and well past the notice of default I received the template letter telling me my claims were of no force and effect. At that point I filed a Statement of Claim in the Federal Court (silly me) (T-1395-12, under files tab is the judgement).

Since that day (Prothonotary Ruling) I&#39;ve not heard a peep from the CRA. Maybe I have them in a pickle, maybe not.

Flaherty has been clear, The CPP is not in trust for future gens, its being used to pay the current batch of dupes sip&#39;n sherry in Florida (if that is it&#39;s use). Whom do I lien to have that energy/equity/value flow to the trust. 

As sole authorized rep and beneficiary of the NAME I suspect 
MY CORPORATION should lien the name into the trust (or would that be the trustee). This would place the Trust &#34;first in time&#34; whereby the Corporation (Trustee?) can Notice all parties (the Commish of Revenue CRA/ADP/ Receiver General?) to direct my equity/energy/value, Fed Tax, CPP and E.I. back to the trust. 

I dont want to work this job as slave much longer. My intent is to have as much value as possible flow in trust so that I can prepare for whats coming.

lots of us are trapped on the ranch, some as cattle some as cowboys, we all report to the rancher whether we are chattels or empolyee&#39;s. Fuck that, my energy has value and the rancher is a pedophile

Is this even possible, is my only option to leave the game altogether. I only want whats rightfully mine. Our malfeasant trustees must be done away with or forced to return our property. 

am I thinking wrong, do I value the wrong things?

    Why all the fuss over the gold standard?

Well it goes back to the original Founding Fathers and the meaning of the word &#34;dollar&#34;. &#34;Dollar&#34; is actually a weight measure of silver, 371.25 grains, to be exact. Our American silver dollars are actually heavier, since other metals were added for durability. But that 371.25 grains of silver WAS the dollar, matching in weight an unbroken chain of accepted monetary units that reached back through the Spanish Milled Dollar, the Dutch Daller, back to the German Thaler; the product of a silver mine which sold its product in coins of an exact weight. The Coinage Act of 1792 defined our dollar to exactly match in weight the silver dollars in use around the world, and then defined the gold dollar to be that amount of gold which would equal the worth of silver in a silver dollar, 24.75 grains, 1/15 the weight of the silver in a silver dollar.

    This question is for Scott Duncan, yet if any feel you can better contribute than Scott (good luck with that), and/or you are certain of the answer, please feel free to comment ... at your own peril, of course. 
 
Back in May, in a civil matter for debt collection from a local bank, for a small amount ($3,000.00USD), a municipal court send a NOTICE OF HEARING for August.  
 
They all received back a NoM, voided orders, new originals, with the BC/SURETY BOND attached, meaning the &#34;DEFENDANT/DEMANDADO) is already in the custody, via registered mail, plus it was filed in the court file as well. 

Shorter version of the story, The trial  was &#34;held&#34; last October 9th, and the sentence was &#34;WITH PLACE, WITH TRIAL IN THEIR MERITS, Fund. 43&#34; &#34;Status&#34;; RESOLVED, INACTIVE SINCE 09302013 &#34;  Now, &#34;Fund. 43&#34;, what the heck is that? 

The PERSON never received notices  after NOTICING the MISTAKE, but their website say they did.

Does that means they settled the accounting and closed it, as per the NoM, or does that mean the PERSON better cough-up the &#34;money&#34; quickly because they railroaded HIM? It&#39;s seems they still PROCEEDED. 

It&#39;s hard to tell, because I don&#39;t have any documents from the court. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance!

    I put together a document for myself to help with my comprehension of the principles taught here.  
It is most of Scott&#39;s Articles in one place.
It is a lengthy document and encompasses most of the articles with a couple of other contributions that are relevant.

    Hi folks,
I�ve been going over posts to find out about the VOIDing that you do and from what I�ve read, if I received a unilateral contract/speeding fine in the post from the GARDA (Police), how do I void the ticket? 
Would I put VOID (in red) on the fine in maker/pen, do I then return to sender by registered post?
Would I put the following too on the front of the envelope or would this be a mistake?

RETURN TO SENDER.
I DO NOT RECOGNISE YOU.
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR INTENT.
WE HAVE NO INTERNATIONAL TREATY.
NO ASSURED VALUE.
NO SURETY ACCEPTED.
WE HAVE NO CONTRACT.

If this step did not work for what ever reason and it happened to proceed to Court, the GARDA would be prosecuting and not a solicitor/lawyer. 

Would I send the Garda an affidavit and a NoM? 
When the case would be called would you, except the name that is called GARDA OINK vs. LEE EDGELY? Or rebut that NAME called and/or just state for the record that you are there on a conditional appearance (there is no special appearance in Ireland. If there is a special appearance I can not find anything on it.) And then reserve all rights?

The Garda would then automatically walk to the stand to speak, would I let him speak before anything else happens? then rebut everything and/or call POINT OF ORDER before he has started/finished speaking? 

Then continue with the question of asking did you receive my affidavit and NoM, (YES).
Answer the questions GARDA, because this can not proceed until I can UNDERSTAND the nature of these proceedings.
AND KEEP REPEATING and POINT OF ORDER until I get answers from him? 
Or the Judge asks me how I wish to proceed.

Please help me as I feel confused sometimes when I read some posts.

    I just got a call from a woman who identified herself as an agent with the FBI.  She wanted to ask some questions about how I was treated when I got arrested.  I politely declined a phone conversation and a face to face meeting......Any ideas what this is about?

    OK, while some in here are getting way out of sight, I have a question concerning ESTABLISHING a TRUST. :P

I see that this new trust will need to be domiciled....

I am in a CIVIL CODE Zone, and it fucks me up concerning this TRUST, I would like to establish.

Can this trust&#39;s address could be in Ontario, and the person I happen to have in my pocket in Quebec, and the Corporation I registered, in Quebec as wll ?

Would that help, or be completely irrelevant ?

Thanks
Pierre

    Money? We don&#39;t need no stinking money!

Tip #1. Fall is here. Instead of using expensive toilet paper, use the leaves lying on the ground everywhere.

Tip #2. Instead of drinking those expensive starbux coffees, try urine. I hear it&#39;s really good for you and it&#39;s a great way to recycle.

Feel free to share your tips...

    So I spent the morning in Court today and got the opportunity to serve the Crown and the Court with my Notice of Mistake,I also included a photo copy of the birth certificate,my private I.D. and the receipt placed in my property bag by police after I deposited the B.C. with the Court Clerk at the status hearing months ago before Judge Chester.I asked the Judge&#34;In what capacity does the NAME exist as it appears on the information before the Court?&#34; and he refused to answer me,He stated that I was the &#34;Person&#34; on the information so I then asked what the Court&#39;s definition of &#34;Person&#34; is?..again no answer!He told me these issues can be raised at trial! I recorded everything but I wont post it because last time I was charged for publishing the court proceedings so I&#39;ll just wait and use this information in any civil proceedings if needed! I stated clearly to the Court that I can not proceed as I have been denied the chance to be made fully informed as to the nature and cause of the proceedings and unless the questions in my &#34;Notice of Mistake&#34; are answered,I would consider The proceedings to be in violation of my right to be made fully informed!

    &#34;Bob Week&#34; aka: Jay Hank/Jeff Roggers/Who-Are-You Frisbey has, once more, LEFT the fucking building. 

I didn&#39;t feel it necessary to actually state this, since one would assume that common sense would dictate such a thing, but here we are so obviously it must be said:

If you find yourself banned from the group, the appropriate fucking reaction is NOT to start spawning dummy accounts and jump back in. Perhaps some time spent reflecting on the events which led to your unceremonious exit would serve you better. (The Ministry of Serenity is currently unoccupied and available for self-improvement sessions!)

In the long run, what did this really accomplish? Sure, &#34;Jeff&#34;...uhh, I mean &#34;Bob&#34;, got a few more days of reading in. In the end, the same shit outed him. 

If you have been booted for a reason that is potentially correctable, try that route. If that fails, take comfort in the knowledge that you have NO ONE to blame but yourself.

    For anyone who needs a notary for any administrative processes just inbox me for details of how to get ahold of the notary. Let me know what province or area your in.

          <p>COLUMBUS, OH - An 11-yr-old girl whose mother was shot and killed before her eyes in 2008 by a cop was arrested three years later for directing obscene hand gestures in the direction of cops. They charged the 11-yr-old girl with &#34;persistent disorderly conduct.&#34;

On Jan. 4, 2008, police shot and killed the girl�s peaceful mother, Tarika Wilson, 26, as she huddled with her children. They also shot and killed two dogs belonging to the family. Also shot was the girl�s 1-year-old brother. He survived.

    So, this is likely a stupid question but I need to get it straight in my head. 

Scenario: You get into a car accident and there is damages to a vehicle (not a PERSON)... so the policy enforcement send you home on foot with a ticket for &#34;Careless Driving&#34;, valued at $400 or so. 

Would this be something you can and/or should fight? Or as Scott always asks, &#34;is there an injured party?&#34;, would this be deemed as an injury? It seems to me that the complaint is issued by the Crown, not the injured party �where the damages would be handled by your insurance.

    Sorry to bother�.

I think I understand this SUPRA PROTEST thing correctly :D ? HELLOOSSSS!!!!!

When the person I happen to have in my pocket, receives a Bill of Exchange, I, as a Man, can SUPRA PROTEST that bill of exchange correct ?

So now a MAN, which happen to be �ME�, is FULLY responsible for that debt :D ?

And as a MAN, I can use LAWFUL currency to clear that debt ?, since that these Note is LEGAL tender are for PERSONS :D

Now, LAWFUL currency, mmmhhhh, I have good reasons to believe that POSTAL STAMPS is LAWFUL currency, since that APPARENTLY, it is backed by gold, I goolged that for 2 weeks now, and CAN�T get a clear answer�..Help please ??

But if I am right, which bring this matter hypothetically, and I fucking hate that, but hey�..gotta start somewhere, I, as a man, can use this LAWFUL currency to clear that debt.

Now, what�s a $1 postal stamp can mean in LEGAL tender bank notes ? I guess I am the one who will make this decision :D correct ?

And why should I also use this stupid $0.05 postal stamp on this bill of exchange ?, would it be fair to say it�s to say THANKS to Elizabeth of the House of Windsor ?, because without her, I could not do that SUPRA PROTEST, as a MAN. ?

So, as a man, whatever the LEGAL amount should be, I can and have the right to MATCH it with this $1 LAWFUL currency postal stamps ? :D , unless there is a CONVERSION chart somewhere :D

Of course that bill will become NON-NEGOCIABLE, NON-TRANSFERRABLE, WITHOUT RECOURSE and RETURNED COMPLETED.

WHO could REFUSED that kind of debt discharge ?

Thanks
Pete

    History: I&#39;m home schooling my son and have been for years.  The government harasses me with contracts regarding the above. (SEE - Aldous Home School Form 2010 - web.jpg in the file section) They send me contracts and DEMAND that I fill them out ACCURATELY, sign them, and submit the document to them. THEY say this is MANDATORY. It�s obvious that they want me to be liable to punishment and, or other damages/financial penalties they may wish to inflict on me from time to time as they see fit. Reading their clubhouse rules, I realize that they might claim they have the AUTHORITY to remove him from my custody if they aren�t pleased with what he is learning, and or, should I FAIL to teach him everything they want me to.

Problem: ^^ That SUCKS!

Desired Outcome: I don�t want to be held accountable to a corporation that doesn�t have his best interest at heart, nor, do I want to be BOUND, and, or LEGALLY OBLIGATED to teaching him all of THEIR AGENDA. (He is only allowed to sing �OH HAPPYFACE SID LAND� in the morning, if he wants to). 

Question: If SCOTT DUNCAN received one of these in the post, how would he respond/proceed to achieve my goals in this regard?

    Electric Bill of Exchange�.
The whole story

July 2012, last time I�ve bought back one of the bill

November 1st, 2012 Hydro-Quebec calls me, I said I did not have any of these Bank Notes available for the moment :P

January 2013, Hydro-Quebec decide to put PIERRE DAOUST in collection (They have their OWN collection department) and threatening to cut the service.

The same day, I wrote my first letter to them, I have read the BoE act a few times, I have watched Money as debt a few times, and something inside of me is telling me that I am onto something :D

So that first communication was pretty simple, TRUE, and to the point, no fucking freeman-on-the-land bullshit, and no $5000 words, that I don�t even understand my self :P my goal is NOT to look smart, and I am sure EVERYONE in here will agree on this :D , my goal is THE TRUTH, I never changed that WHY I am here�..and hey, if the TRUTH is I AM A SLAVE, wel, so be it, bring the chains for fuck sakes�. :D

KEY points of that letter�.
1). I tell them that I have received their NOTICE and THREATS.
2). And apparently, I have a debt with them (I was NOT totally aware of who I was at that time :D )
3). Assure them that IF I owe, I want to pay
4). But I have NO ACCESS to Fiduciary Money ( Bank Notes) for the Moment
5). I am SCARED that they cut the service, I have lots of children inside the house and your threats scares me very much :P
6). Is there ANY other payment or remittance method AVAILABLE to me ? :D
7). I OFFER to cut your grass and or wash your windows if it can help

That was the first letter :D and guess what ?  NO ANSWER, but PIERRE DAOUST got out of their collection department, oh the mystery !!!!, so I knew and felt that I was ONTO something, I have shared this in TTFL, and Scott Duncan said: You have NO IDEA how funny this is Pierre, and I replied, you�re right, I have no idea. 

April 2013 shows up, I receive ANOTHER bill of exchange from them with some threats attach to it :D , I send the SAME exact letter, but I add on it: SECOND REQUEST :P

And the same thing happen again�.complete silence on their side, and PIERRE DAOUST don�t seems to be in their collection target.

July arrived :D, I pick up a Bill of Exchange in PIERRE DAOUST�s mail box, and now, after reading and reading, and THINKING and THINKING�.(I think more than I read), I know who I am :D �. And hit them with a NOTICE stating that this is the 3rd request I make, I am really disappointed about their complete silence, the BoE act tell that they HAVE to answer me, and they have 10 days to answer, or I will have to proceed with the comprehension I have, and they will have to accept :P

NO ANSWER, so August the 6th, I have ADMINISTRATED and complete that Bill of Exchange, sent the original to Bank of Canada, and a copy to Hydro-Quebec.

And then, September the 17th ( a Saturday morning), the phone�s ring, so I pick up the phone and say: HELLOSSS!!!! :D

That guy at the other end says: MISTER PIERRE DAOUST PLEASE, I said My name is Pierre, he said hi my name is so and so from Hydro-Quebec and I would like to answer your questions and help�. :D , I said OK, go ahead�HAHAHAHA!!!!, he said well, heuh, what�s you questions ?, I said do you have my communications I sent you via registered mail ?, he said one of them, I said have you read it ?, and the he started the SKATING fucking game, it was HILARIOUS, I have a recording of this, in French, and at one point I said wow wow wow, stop that please and send me all this in writing, he refused, he said he don�t have the RIGHT to send documents in writing, I said well, that is too bad :D

Anyway, the day after, I wrote a beautiful letter :D ,  I tell them that one of their agent called the person I happen to have in my pocket, and tried to either fraud, confuse, or install some controversies in PIERRE DAOUST�s affairs, and from now on, I will ONLY accept ALL communications via mail.

I said, If ever you want to REFUSE the administrating process I used, as the sole authorized ADMINISTRATOR for PIERRE DAOUST, you have to ADVISE me in writing AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

I said, BANK of Canada, haven�t contacted me about any defect and/or refusal from their part.

I said, if you need a copy of the audio recording of this phone calls for your file, I can send one to you via email :P

you have 10 days to NOTICE me of a fault, defect or refusal concerning the administration process of that bill of exchange, If I don�t hear from you, I will UNDERSTAND that this is settled and close :P

NOTHING AS OF NOW !!!!

I want to share this because, without really knowing it, I have used a very POWERFUL method in here�..think of that first letter I�ve sent back in January�.you see, my INTENTS are good faith all the way�.I am asking for the TRUTH�..tell me the fucking TRUTH, that�s all�.and I have good reasons to believe that when you ask something, and they don�t answer, they have something to hide��.

Oh, I have started TEACHING other French Frogs about all this, they start seeing me in a more serious way :D , I mean, they can laugh, but it�s been 15 months I have not played the SURETY role for this hydro bill, and same thing with 5 other bills� :P

And I am one heck of a good teacher :D , almost as much as I am a good administrator, 

Thanks
Pete

    I have a question for Scott Duncan:

1) You had mentioned in a previous post that sending an &#34;Affidavit of Affirmation&#34; to the Register of Demographics Office (that&#39;s the name of the agency that issues surety bonds here) claiming the PERSON, would be sufficient to cover &#34;MY&#34; obligation. Would this process be sufficient to place a LIEN on the PERSON? 

And if so, who makes the CLAIM, &#34;ME&#34; with my TAKEN NAME as a MAN, and/or a proxy?

Thanks for any time to respond, Admiral.

    I�m not sure if I�ve had somewhat of an epiphany, or, if the following is a shit stain that will never get posted. Here it goes:

If I understand this correctly, from my new TTFL perspective, it is important that I understand that in a system which uses money of ACCOUNT, &#34;money&#34; concerning the Security Instrument in my wallet, can ALSO be realized/created WITHOUT my signature. 

An accountant for example, can magically �create� a negative amount of money by registering a NEW ACCOUNT in a ledger, and by identifying the SECURITY INTEREST I have in my pocket/wallet, they are investing in a gamble that I will be willing to become the SURETY for the NEGATIVE amount of money they created. They are hoping that I won�t choose to discharge/set-off the debt, and, that they can trick me into providing them with money of EXCHANGE. 

If I don�t provide them either my signature (which accepts SURETY), or MONEY of EXCHANGE, the ACCOUNTANT who �signed off� on the ledger entry, and, or, the UNDERWRITERS who BONDED the actions of the PUBLIC SERVANT PERSON who &#34;signed off&#34; on the requisition/order to the accountant to make the entry, will surely be held ACCOUNTABLE. If the accountant entered/created a large enough negative number, AND they don�t get ME to act as SURETY for the PERSON they recently CREATED in their new ledger entry - jobs will be lost, vessels will be sunk, as  BONDS become LIQUIDATED to settle the account.

AND, if I have been smart enough to follow Scott�s advice, and have previously liened the name of the SECURITY INTEREST in my pocket/wallet, the credit applied (and intended to balance out the account), is mine to claim and enjoy through the TRUST which is handled by my corporation. Once I claim it, they have to create/source even more money to settle the account.

Such a scenario therefore, serves not only my financial interests, but it also servers my AGENDA (and perhaps Scott�s agenda) in that it undermines every institution which chooses to operate and act in such a manner. It punishes them for their complicity in this global fraud.

**************

Scott, I recall you saying something about half of all math and the number zero. Were you referring to the fact that in a ledger dealing with MONEY OF ACCOUNT, half of all the numbers entered will be negative (on one side of zero), while the other half of all numbers entered will be POSITIVE (on the other side of zero) in order to balance the books (get them to RETURN TO ZERO)? 

Am I way off track with this train of thought? Tips, corrections, and constructive advice/criticism is welcome as usual.

    &#34;... is forfeit to Her Majesty the Queen in right of the province of BC... ...The Civil Forfeiture Act&#34;

The owner of a house repeatedly visited by the police in recent years has been ordered to pay $200,000 to the provincial government.

The civil forfeiture judgment means that, not only will the owner have to pay, but if there is any illegal activity there in the next five years, the government can simply take the house in the 7300 block of 208th Street.

Robin Joseph Krayem, one of the owners of the property, has been convicted of unauthorized possession of a firearm and of possession of instruments for forging or falsifying credit cards, said Langley RCMP Cpl. Holly Marks.

Both offences took place on the property, which police say has been identified as a problem home since 2011.

Police have been called there for gun offenses, stolen goods investigations, and for the report of credit card fraud.

At the beginning of 2012, Langley RCMP Const. Mike Schnerch put together a package about the land for the Civil Forfeiture Office.

In August, the director of Civil Forfeiture for B.C. signed an agreement with Krayem and the other owners of the property.

&#34;Judgment is granted in favour of the plaintiff, the Director of Civil Forfeiture, against the defendant Robin Joseph Krayem&#39;s interest in the property, that interest is declared to be the proceeds and an instrument of unlawful activity, and $200,000 of that interest is forfeit to Her Majesty the Queen in right of the province of British Columbia in accordance with the Civil Forfeiture Act...&#34; reads the deal.

Police hope that with the deal, especially the five-year ban on illegal activity on pain of complete forfeiture, that the property will no longer be an issue.

&#34;We are very pleased with a ruling of this type for both the community and from a policing perspective,&#34; said Insp. Murray Power, operations support officer for the

Langley Mounties. &#34;Residences such as this one become a significant drain on police resources and often a daily nuisance for those living in close proximity.&#34; The property has in fact been a magnet for police since at least 2009.

    Traffic Ticket Bill of Exchange No.1

January the 10th, 2013, while I was administrating a steering wheel, and a gaz pedal, and a brake pedal, for the person I happen to have in my pocket, which is named PIERRE DAOUST, a private contractor stopped me, he has a gun on him :(

So I asked him if I was OBLIGE to give him the person�s name, he said YES. So since he had a gun, and I don�t, I gave him the name of the person I happen to have in my pocket.

The fuck up in all this is that �me�, as a Man, I don�t get to be recognize in ALL this shit, these guys are looking for PERSONS��so hey, I have one :)
So he proceed with the preparation of a Bill of Exchange for PIERRE DAOUST, yes traffic tickets ARE bill of exchange.

I took it, since I am the SOLE authorized administrator for PIERRE DAOUST, and brought it in my office. After verifying all this, I could not find any CONTRACT hooked between PIERRE DAOUST, and the city of montreal. 

So I sent back this BoE written NO CONTRACT on it.

Beginning of July 2013, I received a NOTICE from the city of Montreal, with a Bill of Exchange of $295.00 :D

On that NOTICE, it says that PIERRE DAOUST has been found GUILTY of something, and PIERRE DAOUST has been JUDGE for something :/ .

So I simply discharged that debt for PIERRE DAOUST, and sent a request to City of Montreal with 2 simple questions, for my OWN curiosity.

Please send me the NAME, ADDRESS and inscription number of the PERSON who decided to enter a plea for PIERRE DAOUST, and the NAME, ADDRESS and inscription number of the PERSON who judge PIERRE DAOUST�..nothing fancy, just 2 simple questions.

They�ve replied that I had to CALL them to have answer on these questions, and that if I don�t call them, They will not follow up with this matter.

So I called :D �..and of course, record that call, the lady named LISE who spoke with me on the phone, was trying to scares me with ALL that would happen if I don�t PAY the tickets, I stopped her several time during the conversation and ask her to LISTEN to me�.so I had to raise my voice a bit��and I told her to FOCUS on the 2 questions, I told her that I don�t give a shit about ANYTHING else�..

She finally answered :D �.and confirmed that a computer system entered a plea on PIERRE DAOUST, and a computer system JUDGE PIERRE DAOUST. I said THANK YOU and hung up :D

So I have wrote a nice NOTICE, you guys knows how good of an ADMINISTRATOR I am :D saying that the BoE was discharged, unless they can prove otherwise, the Bank of Canada accept it, unless they can prove otherwise, There was no DEFECT on the instrument, unless they can prove otherwise, The city of Montreal did not REFUSED the administration process so far, unless they can prove otherwise.

And PIERRE DAOUST has been judge by a computer system, and a plea has been entered for PIERRE DAOUST by a computer system, I can email the audio recording to you for your file :D

I gave them 10 days to REFUSE the administration process used concerning that BoE, and an affidavit to prove ANY of the points above.

So, 10 days after, I received a very small letter from them CONFIRMING the Name of the �Justice� who pleaded for PIERRE DAOUST, and judged PIERRE DAOUST. :D
That�s it that�s all��

My thinking is that THEY just could NOT leave that computer system thing open, they were fucked with this�.and that was October the 8th, 2013.
I have NOT received anything regarding a refusal concerning the administration process used to discharged that debt. Maybe Scott can say something about this ?

I will come back with Traffic Ticket Bill of Exchange No.2 Shortly, which is very interesting as well :D

Again�..my INTENTS are to get the TRUTH from these PUBLIC SERVANTS, if I amd a SLAVE, I need to know, and want the chains that goes with the title, I want these chains via REGISTERED mail :P

Thanks
Pete

    Traffic Ticket Bill of Exchange No.2

This freaking PIERRE DAOUST got a traffic ticket again :(

It happen July, the 11th 2013, apparently, the car was going 58 Km/h, in a Construction Zone, which is suppose to be 40 Km/h, instead 50 Km/h. I know it�s fucking confusing but hey�..that guy had a gun again, so what I am going to do ?....fight with him ? ..no way fuck :D

Anyway, same shit happened, this armed private body guard proceeded with COMMENCING a Bill of Exchange, and since PIERRE DAOUST has NO HANDS, I took it for it, and brought that shit in MY office.

Again, after verification, I could not find a freaking contract, but I say what the heck, they must PRESUMED we have one, but anyway, I have no time for that shit so, I did the ADMINISTRATION concerning that Bill of Exchange, I did it LIKE A MAN, not like a fucking �VICTIMIZED FAGGOT� :P

I sent the City of Montreal a very nice detailed explanation of the Bill of Exchange functioning, on one single 8 � x 11 page. 

I sent the BoE COMPLETED to bank of Canada, and the photo copy of it, with the explanation to the city of montreal.

I gave them 10 days to OBJECT to that administration process, and if I don�t hear from them, I will have no other choices than to UNDERSTAND their acceptance.

Easy, sharp and sweet��But September the 6th, I receive a NOTICE from City of Montreal saying this :

We wish to inform you that the explanations you have provided with your plea of not guilty give rise to a matter that ought to be brought before the court. ??????? :-o

Fuck !! :/ , I haven�t pleaded non-guilty ????....I have discharged the debt WTF ????? 

Anyway, I had to go back to MY office, and follow up with this BoE�s administration, I saw no other choices for me.

So, I have remind them that I AM THE sole authorized administrator for the person, unless they can prove otherwise.

I have completed the BoE no. XXXXX, for PIERRE DAOUST, I sent it to the Bank of Canada, unless you can prove otherwise, or you can prove that Bank of Canada did NOT accept it, or a defect or blablabla�..

I have sent a photo copy of the discharge, and the registered mail number.
I said I had NEVER pleaded NON-Guilty and never gave any explanation regarding PIERRE DAOUST being not-guilty of something, unless you can prove otherwise.

I said YOU have pleaded NON-guilty for YOUR file, and YOU have gave some explanations about it, so, I have ALL the good reasons to BELIEVE that, YOU must be the defense party in YOUR case, and I wish you the best of luck :D (I am not lying, if I say I said it, I have said it :D )

I said for ALL other minutes of my life regarding this Bill of Exchange, I will now have to charge you Fifty dollars per minute ( I know I should have said $3000.00 per hour, but hey, I can correct MISTAKES :D )

I said, you have been paid and this BoE is completed, unless you can prove otherwise�.

You have 10 days to send me an AFFIDAVIT with proofs requested

BY:_______(sign here)________
Sole Authorized Administrator for PIERRE DAOUST inscription no. XXXXXXXXXXXX

That was sent last September the 16th 2013.
:P

I really have to thanks Blake Gardner , I deal very good with controversy and confusion because of reading his posts regarding this specific matter.......

They are pro at it, they were educate to create controversy and confusion

That&#39;s why I repeat often in here: I am a MAN, and I have a person. I am a Man, and I have a person...

You have no idea how many times I have repeated this to &#34;ME&#34; .....Conditionning and Endoctrination works both sides... :D

Thanks
Pete

    &#34;Still, if you will not fight for the right when you can easily win without bloodshed, if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not so costly, you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance for survival. There may be a worse case. You may have to fight when there is no chance of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.&#34; � Winston Churchill.

          <p>Four years ago, Oslo-man Christopher Koch&#39;s girlfriend scoffed at his purchase of $27-worth of Bitcoin. Chances are she was singing a decidedly different tune last April, when Koch checked back in on his investment and found out it was worth $886,000. And over a cool million today.</p>

When it was &#34;my turn&#34;, the Judge looked at me and said &#34;Do you have anything to add to this motion?&#34;  I said &#34;It is sworn testimony in the form of an Affidavit, it is not a motion.&#34; He said &#34;I am treating it as a motion.&#34; I said &#34;Then you would be treating it wrong.&#34;  He said &#34;Motion denied.&#34;

Scott, what would you have done in this situation?

    � 1. Of the state, and of sovereignty

 A NATION or a state is, as has been said at the beginning of this work, a body politic, or a society of men united together for the purpose of promoting their mutual safety and advantage by their combined strength. From the very design that induces a number of men to form a society which has its common interests, and which is to act in concert, it is necessary that there should be established a Public Authority, to order and direct what is to be done by each in relation to the end of the association. This political authority is the Sovereignty; and he or they who are invested with it are the Sovereign

    The Post Office and Judicial Courts were established before the seat of the Government.
On Thursday, Sept.  17, 1789 we find written, Mr. Goodhue, for the committee 
appointed for the purpose, presented a bill to amend part of the Tonnage act, which
was read the first time.  The bill sent from the Senate, for the temporary establishment
of the Post Office, was read the second and third time, and passed.    The bill 
for establishing the Judicial Courts  . . . , for establishing the seat of government
Other references to the Post Office support my theory of the founding
forefather�s views:
POST OFFICE. A place where letters are received to be sent to the persons to whom
they are addressed. 
2. The post office establishment of the United States, is of the greatest importance
to the people and to the government. The constitution of the United States has invested
congress with power to establish post offices and post roads. Art. 1, s. 8, n. 7.
3. By virtue of this constitutional authority, congress passed several laws anterior
to the third day of March 1825, when an act, entitled &#34;An act to reduce into
one the several acts establishing and regulating the post office department,&#34;
was passed. 3 Story, U. S. 1825. It is thereby enacted, 1. That there be established,
the seat of the government of the United States, a general post office, under the
direction of a postmaster general.  [259]
 We need to take notice where the commas are placed on that last sentence.  That
there be established, the seat of the government of the United States, a general
post office, under the direction of a postmaster general. When I set off a clause
with commas, I make sure that the sentence makes sense without that clause.  Taking
out the set-off clause, we read, . . . the seat of the government of the United
States under the direction of a postmaster general.
 The creation of the Post office occurs before the creation of the seat of the government, and is placed in authority over the seat of government.  What is the effect of these
legal techniques?  The stated position of an object and the sequence of events play an important role in the Universal Legal Technology.  The effect is that the Government�s later bankruptcies in 1859 and 1929 have no legal effect upon the solvent Post Office.
We can make a case that the formation of the Post Office before the formation of
the government�s operations is a stroke of dumb luck.  Perhaps it is ingenious,
since communication has a higher value than government itself.  If any government
fails, the people still have a need to communicate with one another to form a new
government. And to this day, the Post Office is still solvent and operational, ready
to fulfill its duty to help the people in their communications; to set a new government
should a complete break down of the existing governmental structures occur in the
United States.  Sounds like a very good back up plan. 
 The formation of the Universal Postal Union in 1874 has another legal effect that
is very important to the Universal-Legal-Technology.  The Universal Postal Union
unites member countries into a single, worldwide postal territory.  We have
already learned that any litigant is going into international jurisdiction every
time he goes to any court.  Since the litigant needs to establish that his papers
are official, he uses a dollar postage stamp on the face of the first page.  The
stamps also invoke postal statutes and the Universal Postal Union jurisdiction. 
Currently in the U. S., the stamp of choice is the fox U. S. dollar postage
stamp.  The stamp is not drawn in a box, making the forty-five-degree lines unnecessary.
The litigant does, however, need to autograph across the stamp, then date the autograph,
for two reasons: to comply with postal regulations concerning private mail carriers,
and to make a continuance of evidence that the process (paper work) is mail.  The
continuation of evidence is less of a factor, since the definitions of mail
and delivery can include a clerk at a grocery store handing a customer a receipt
for groceries.  
( Heres&#39;s my question!!!! Are we/I missing something, as far as the SEAT of Gov,as mentioned?? Help me understand this, Can the PO, be used as a court??) Read the Part about where the comma&#39;s are placed!

    Look Right...Look Left...No Smoking...No Running...No Loitering...Mind The Gap...

You can�t trip over your own shoelaces in this country without breaking a law or rule of some description. Every decision seems to offend the sensibilities of one group or another. And at every turn, every juncture, there�s a nosy official waiting to tell you what you should or should not be doing. They sneak out from behind telephone booths, they cross the street to correct your every move. A tsk-tsk here, a tut-tut there. A wag of the finger is never more than a minor public infraction away.

But just try asking them Why? or Why Not? and you�ll draw a stare as blank as a politician�s conscience. Then, after a long and confused silence, they�ll remember the appropriate response to such questions of authority. And they�ll recite, blindly, from some deep, dark place in their unquestioning little brains, �Because that�s the law.�

    We received a &#34;Property tax assessment notice&#34; then an &#34;Overdue Notice&#34;. We are not ones who don&#39;t pay, however, we are also not comfortable signing any of &#34;their&#34; offers/notices nor do we want any presumptions made that we are holding any office for them on our property. We did not detach the top portion and keep it for our records. We did send it back registered mail, addressed to the finance minister personally, with &#34;We do not understand the nature and causes of these notices, however, we wish to settle the account with the enclosed cheque&#34; and &#34;this is a matter of public record #bla bla bla&#34;. Had three witnesses sign. We signed the top portion with all rights reserved as the equitable title holders. The cheque sent had the amount that just so happened to be the home owner grant amount. The cheque also stated on the &#34;memo&#34; line &#34;to settle account #bla bla bla&#34;. We did not receive anything back , however, the cheque was cashed. Any corrections Scott? Would you suggest following up? I would think they have accepted our offer and understand us, as that is what we told him to do.

    Admiral Scott Duncan, when you say (paraphrasing) &#34;By what/which authority are YOU attaching a NAME derived from a PUBLIC DOCUMENT to ME?,&#34; is it because &#34;they&#34; know who really OWNS the NAME, and therefore know it&#39;s FRAUD to attach CROWN PROPERTY to a MAN, without CONSENT?

    Greetings Warriors!  I wanted to share how I removed my car from the registration matrix of the corporate State of California.  It was very easy to do (�so easy, a caveman can do it�).  We know the matrix is full of adhesion contracts.  I heard various ideas on how to skirt the system which required forever covering the VIN (never do this); but none included actual removal from the matrix, no one knew how.  I didn�t want to skirt it � I wanted totally out.  [EDIT: What I mean by removal is cancelation of the contract and not receiving any further offers to contract.] A close friend already had a US DOT number plate, and covered the VIN.  So I did some research, which I love to do. [US DOT = United States Department of Transportation (federal)]

 

First, I obtained a US DOT number and had a plate made, which says at the bottom �Not for Hire�; it is not �registrant only� because I did not know about the US DOT number until after �registrant only� was phased out for new applicants.

 

Second, when I received the corporate Notice of Registration Renewal (offer to re-up the contract) I returned the corporate state�s property (license plates) to the DMV by priority mail flat rate envelope to its headquarters in Sacramento � not the local branch.  I mailed the plates along with an Actual and Constructive Notice letter, the renewal notice with �cancelled� written diagonally across the face and the last registration certificate to a living natural person in charge of registration operations.  I located the DMV directory containing this information.  The &#34;Reader&#39;s Digest&#34; version of my letter: I specifically detailed the DMV codes relating to registration and the various related definitions from the code along with the one that says in the event of a federal definition, the federal trumps the state.  Then I buried the coffin with the federal definitions.  I told them in light of the fraud, the DMV was directed to update their records to reflect that my VIN refers to a private car that was not involved in commerce and therefore not a type required to be registered.  Also the addressee would be held personally liable if I suffered damages at the hands of �revenue officers� due to non-compliance with my instructions.  I signed it �All Rights Reserved, 1-308� above the signature. 

 

I keep a copy of the letter and evidence of mailing in my car glove box.  Haven�t received any response (not that I expected to) and it has been several months.  The DMV here sends out [late] notices [and penalty fees] when you are delinquent with registration.  It�s that easy once you know own what you know.  I�ve helped two friends (including the one with the DOT plate) do the same.  This information is hidden in plain view; you just have to know it�s there.  He who does not know his rights has none.  I cannot recall where I found bits and pieces of the puzzle posted online that contributed to my education on the how, but I am forever thankful and grateful to those kindred spirits.  I hope this helps those who may be searching for a way out.  [I researched using what is freely posted on the net as a guide and composed my response. Your state may vary . Check out famguardian.org, sedm.org, 1215.org, state-citizen.org, freeinhabitant.info, smileyjharris.blogspot.com, and search the Sovereign Warriors forum; these are just a few of the resources where you can find information. ]

    Heading to the Million Mask March tomoz guys, might have a bit of an issue with the whole Assembly topic. here is a copy from the state of Victoria, Australia law hand book: UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY

In Victoria unlawful assembly is not defined in an Act of Parliament but is a common law offence prohibiting an assembly of three or more people with an intent to commit a crime by open force, or with intent to carry out any common purpose, whether lawful or not, in such a manner as to give reasonable people in the vicinity reasonable grounds to fear a breach of the peace.

Also, under section 10 of the Unlawful Assemblies and Processions Act 1958 (Vic), any person who attends and takes part in an unlawful assembly, as defined by the Act, which includes any political demonstration, is guilty of an offence. This charge is very rarely used, but it does illustrate the power that governments have to stop &#34;political&#34; actions if they wish to do so.  I&#39;ll keep you all posted on what happens, we all have video recorders etc, My belief is that if our &#34;tax&#34; dollars pay for it and it&#39;s public property then we can basically do what we like, the police cannot tell us where to go otherwise that is contracting with them..

    OK, what the heck happened in Canada, on February the 14 1977.

3. (1) Subject to this Act, a person is a citizen if

    (a) the person was born in Canada after February 14, 1977;

And what does that mean ?
4. (1) For the purposes of paragraph 3(1)(a), every person who, before apparently attaining the age of seven years, was found as a deserted child in Canada shall be deemed to have been born in Canada, unless the contrary is proved within seven years from the date the person was found.

    SCOTT DUNCAN- CAN YOU PLACE THIS BY THE DOUBLE AMPUTEE STORY, THANKS! 
 There were once some words written on a piece of parchment (with those words now known as the Fourth Amendment), that said that you have the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures at the hands of �government� agents. In Indiana today, what could that possibly mean? The message from the ruling class is quite clear, and utterly insane. It amounts to this: �We don�t have the right to invade your home without probable cause � but if we DO, you have no right to stop us, and we have the right to arrest you if you try.�

Why not apply that to the rest of the Bill of Rights, while we�re at it? �You have the right to say what you want, but if we use violence to shut you up, you have to let us.� (I can personally attest to the fact that that is the attitude of the U.S. �Department of Justice.�) �You have the right to have guns, but if we try to forcibly and illegally disarm you, and you resist, we have the right to kill you.� (Ask Randy Weaver and the Branch Davidians about that one.) �You have the right to not testify against yourself, but when we coerce you into confessing (and call it a �plea agreement�), you can�t do a thing about it.� What good is a �right��what does the term �right� even mean�if you have an obligation to allow jackboots to violate your so-called �rights�? It makes the term absolutely meaningless.

To be blunt, if you have the right to do �A,� it means that if someone tries to STOP you from doing �A��even if he has a badge and a politician�s scribble (�law�) on his side�you have the right to use whatever amount of force is necessary to resist that person. That�s what it means to have an unalienable right. If you have the unalienable right to speak your mind (a la the First Amendment), then you have the right to KILL �government� agents who try to shut you up. If you have the unalienable right to be armed, then you have the right to KILL �government� agents who try to disarm you. If you have the right to not be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures, then you have the right to KILL �government� agents who try to inflict those on you.

Those who are proud to be �law-abiding� don�t like to hear this, and don�t like to think about this, but what�s the alternative? If you do NOT have the right to forcibly resist injustice�even if the injustice is called �law��that logically implies that you have an obligation to allow �government� agents to do absolutely anything they want to you, your home, your family, and so on. Really, there are only two choices: you are a slave, the property of the politicians, without any rights at all, or you have the right to violently resist �government� attempts to oppress you. There can be no other option.

    TODAY&#39;S WORD - A new TENDER FOR LAW feature!

You may only &#34;like&#34; on this thread. I am keeping it clean of community input. Posting in this thread is futile. Only admins can post.

We are teaching these VERY important words, in order to explain concepts that will be taught here in the near future.

My lovely Tara, shall begin your education with the first word! 

Take it away, TARA! :D

    I am in the PACIFIC FUCKING OCEAN, and I am spending a shit-load of money on my crappy data plan to read this fucking group.

Honestly, this is the only thing worth reading these days. Nothing else has any content. It&#39;s an expensive habit. I hope you all appreciate it. I have been experiencing withdrawal symptoms while I&#39;ve been on the high seas. The bill will almost be worth it.

That is all. Carry on.

    I received this letter today from a lawyer in response to my request for proof that i was obligated to deal with him. Also just for the record, this response/letter is his confirmation that he has accepted full commercial liability and a willing respondent for a potential commercial lien. It&#39;s also provided me with a useful quote for my response to him :D

    Please help folks: If I got a court summons, I write an affidavit and attach a NoM as an exhibit, do I also attach a Birth Cert? if so does it have to be an original B.C. or do I get a photocopy of it to get signed and stamped by a solicitor?
Would I necessarily need to give the PERSON into their custody to stop the judge from issuing a warrant?

    Marcus of www.servantking.info has been mentioned in various threads at different times...

If the Admiral allows it, here&#39;s an update via email:

&#39;Hi:
 
I told you I would reply when I decided. Unraveled Programs will be online in just a few days. Check Daily.
 
Due to the many kind comments I have received, I have decided to give my work to you. All I ask is for you to create as many links as you can to www.servantking.info, all around the world. Not for my benefit, but for the benefit of others.
 
I will also provide on the website the You-tube, Embed Code for all of the videos. Please place both the Confusion and Unraveled Videos on as many websites as you can.
 
This will be your investment.
 
&#34;For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.&#34;
 
Till then ..... my name is Marcus&#39;

His website: http://www.sovereigntyinternational.info/why.html

    The-Person&#39;s Administration Thread :P

I received a few PM recently concerning the person I have in my pocket is administration.

And all of these questions directed to &#34;ME&#34; by some members in here were related to: BY WHAT AUTHORITY I DECIDE TO BE THE ADMINISTRATOR of the person I happen to have in my pocket. Like, who gives me the authority to do this :/

It&#39;s in my pocket for fuck sakes, and I have not stole it... :/

Like if suddenly, I am doing something WRONG because I say I am the administrator of that person :D

I see with this type of thinking, where Scott Duncan is leading us with his famous: You think wrong, and value the wrong thing :)

We have ALWAYS administrate that person, HELLOOSSS!!!! :D

It&#39;s not a new thing I am doing, I always been the Sole Authorized Administrator of that person, I was just a bad administrator, or worse, I had no clue that I had something in my pocket that needed to be administrate :P

So, here HOW I see this....

I was born :P

The government created a person and put that thing in my pocket, no explanations, no signature from my part, no understanding from my part, I was 3 weeks old for christ sakes .....

So they&#39;ve put it there, They&#39;ve signed as surety, and made sure I don&#39;t get to learn all that shit.....they&#39;ve taught me to get a good education, to have a good job, and to act as surety for that person. Very simple plan :D

And today, I am aware of all that shit, so I will STILL be the Sole Authorized Administrator for that person, like I&#39;ve always been, but will administrate a little, very slightly different :D

Until they decide to REMOVE that person from me :D

Think about that, the government shows up at your place to take away the person, because they don&#39;t feel very good with the administration methods you use...even though ALL that you do is completely LEGAL.......HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!

That would be an AWESOME DAY for me, they would ADMIT by doing such a thing, that we are ALL slaves.....a get out of the closet type of thing :D

And I don&#39;t have to advise them about a sudden intent of me wanting to administrate the person.....I just start administrating a new way, and let them know in the process, WHO I AM.....

who cares about what they will think, in fact, I am not even sure that they will think :(

    Maa posted this somewhere a while ago and I had not finished reading it until now. 

Mo Chara, you asked what money is? Here is a good, fundamental explanation of what money as debt is as far as banking goes.

    from:What Really Happened!!!

I am glad someone finally came up with a number because this is a statistic I have been searching for a very long time. And from the daily dose of wrongful police shootings being reported, this number looks to be fairly accurate. 

 That means more innocent Americans are being killed by the police than by terrorists, even including those killed on 9-11. Where is the corporate media coverage on this threat to innocent lives? 3 people died in the Boston Marathon bombing and it was non-stop coverage for days on end! The same with Sandy Hook, where 26 people died. None of the SSRI-crazed shooters waved at us by the gun grabbers ever killed anywhere near as many innocent people as the police do, yet got headline coverage across the land. 

 We decry the slaughter of innocent Palestinians by the IDF only to find we have the exact same crisis here, quite possibly because of all those Israelis being hired to train the US police departments. 

 The corporate media failed to report on how vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they are supposed to prevent. The corporate media failed to report that there are serious problems with GMO crops. And to that growing list of cover-ups we can now add that the police kill more innocent Americans than terrorists do.

    Remittance advices thread.

A few brand spanking new ADMINISTRATOR seems to be confused with this STEP, as far as administrating DEBTS. I may be confused as well, feel free to de-confuse me if it�s the case.

The way I see it is pretty simple (How else could it be :D )

When I pick up a Bill of Exchange in PIERRE DAOUST�s mailbox, this PIERRE DAOUST that was created exactly 16 days after I showed up, I need to take care of it�..right now.

So, the ONLY method I was taught, by the MAJORITY, was to BUY BACK these debts, in fact, I believed that I WAS this person named PIERRE DAOUST, so I was picking this BoE in MY mailbox, I was sure that BoE was for ME, so I was BUYING BACK this debt on the spot, and was sending MONEY of account, or Money of exchange to the BENEFICIARY.

But Now, when I pick up those BoE, I KNOW they are addressed to a PERSON that was created 16 days after me, and I know it�s a debt, or I can even call it a THING, and I know there is more than one way to REMIT that thing.

But since I am NOT alone in this, I can ASK the beneficiary to HELP me with this.

So I do ask, I just send a small letter to the beneficiary with the following.

1). I Received the debt you�ve sent to the person I happen to have in my pocket (PIERRE DAOUST)

2). I am the Sole authorized administrator for that person.

3). I WISH you could reveal or disclose ALL methods available to ME, to administrate this debt you�ve just sent to PIERRE DAOUST.

4). You have 30 days to send ME all available methods, or I will have to use the method I am aware of, and you will have to ACCEPT that LEGAL method :P

Your�s Truly :D

BY:_________________________
Sole authorized Administrator for PIERRE DAOUST blab la bla

This step is a MUST, I think, because it gives the opportunity to the beneficiary to tell you the TRUTH, which is a very nice GIFT you make to them :D

And all you have to do is WAIT for them to tell you the truth��good luck !!! :D

Is that freaking simple or what ??? :D

    so as I was being railroaded today the fella in the black robe was quick to bring up meads and meads and Duncun...and some other case law crap...In any case, I lost, rather than being concerned with justice, they were more concerned about me not selecting the correct box on the tickets...yet the secretary said they sent a notice of tril, but the crown P today said there was no notice sent because i didn&#39;t check the box, said my notice of mistake was &#34;nonsensical&#34; which led to a discussion on &#34;persons&#34; and according to the justice I am a person, though he would not answer yes or no when i asked &#34;is it true I have a right to be recognized as a person before the law?&#34;...he just kept saying &#34;you are a person&#34; then dismissed the appeal and got up and left, lol clearly I was nervous and a bit slow, anyway that was my day in court...and sadly I never got to face my accuser, the lying cop that started this shit :( win or lose that was my main goal, but my ignorance of the rules and procedures of are lacking apparently...I&#39;m back Monday for another matter, hopefully the jitters will ease up, lol

    Thank you for the invite. I am about to take on what is at the moment a quite daunting pursuit of getting my NZ Student loan discharged. I do this as I have found out I MIGHT be arrested on my return to NZ for my wedding in December. I can tell you one thing, I will be kicking and screaming if they do, and will be making sure I am considered a political prisoner if they do. So I thank you all in advance for any advice, help, tips, information and guidance in the coming few weeks.

    I don&#39;t want to go the court route so I&#39;m about to lien a bank, &amp; its CFO for not honouring their contract with me and a lawyer. Rather then create an affidavit of obligation, I&#39;m thinking of sending them a copy of the public notice. Give them 10 days to respond and then create the lien if no response and publish the public notice. Is there anything I need to be aware of that I&#39;ve missed or any other suggestions?

    If you read Q44 to Q54, it&#39;s very fun :D

We recommend that you consult with a lawyer of your own choosing in order to be informed of your legal rights regarding bills of exchange.

HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!

Who would want to SUBMIT a Bill of Exchange to the Receveur General ? :/
Also, bills of exchange do not impose any legal obligation on this Department. (gotta find the RIGHT department :D ) HAHAHAHA!!!

I was on that Thread where Rob, wouldn&#39;t answer your Legal Tender ???? He just posted this!

Robert Menard

A note is &#39;legal tender&#39; not because it is marked as such, but because if tendered and accepted payment is achieved and if refused the debt is extinguished by abandonment of the claim. In any event settlement is achieved. 

 Markings on a note stating &#39;This note is legal tender for a specific type of debt&#39; may be deemed to be conclusive evidence of the note being legal tender for that specific type of debt. It does not however generate the status. It merely confirms it.

 For a note to be deemed conclusively as not being legal tender, it must be marked as such.

 Notes not marked as legal tender, may still in fact be legal tender, if they fulfil the function of payment, and refusal of them extinguishes the debt. If the note in question is a method of payment which is statutorily acknowledged, then they are arguably legal tender, even though not marked. It is the function not the label which defines what is or is not legal tender. Counterfeit money is marked as legal tender, though it certainly is not. The label follows the function. 

 This Note is legal tender for all debts public and private.

 There is nothing to suggest that all notes which are legal tender must be suitable for debts both public and private. There is nothing which suggest that something which is legal tender for a public debt must also be legal tender for a private one, or vice versa. There is nothing to suggest that a specific specie of money marked thusly is the only form of legal tender. 

 It is entirely possible that there are other forms of payment, which though not marked as such are legal tender, but only for specific types of debts.

    I suggest they become their own bank, keep a useful amount of legal tender so their corporations can pay bills that require it, or use a bitcoin atm to withdraw what you need and invest what you don&#39;t instantly need back into bitcoin. This could be very interesting because they will have to pay everything with cash...many places won&#39;t accept cash

Any other suggestions?

    Wow...

This is truly appalling to read. In fact, I may NEVER read another article by Salon.com again AND boycott Alternet.org as well.

EVERY single word of this article is a blatant and outright fabrication. The &#34;message&#34; that they are claiming that the book sends, is LITERALLY, the EXACT opposite of what is actually written! 

(How do I know this? Because I&#39;m reading &#34;Atlas Shrugged&#34;, RIGHT NOW.)

And people will believe this! Alternet has a reputation for being a reputable, cutting-edge news source. The vast majority of readers will see this article and accept every word as truth, without ever taking the time to pick the book up and investigate for themselves.

This is despicable in ways I can&#39;t even begin to describe. 

I was angry enough, just reading this book. A piece of literary fiction, written more than 50 years ago, that has been heralded as being one of the great books of our time, read the world over! But the further into the book I get, the more disgusted I am by the fact that people praise Ayn Rand as being a visionary, raved about this book...yet here we are, in 2013, LIVING in the world she describes and every one is too blind to see it

Fucking sheep...

I&#39;m too pissed off to say anything more.

    �Mourners visiting a cemetery in Norway have been left shocked after finding hundreds of gravestones covered in black plastic bags.

Attached to each bag is a late-payment notice, warning relatives of the deceased that the headstone will shortly be removed � unless they cover the cost of the grave�s upkeep.

The controversial move at the Mollendal graveyard in Bergen was orchestrated by a company contracted to run the site.�

    I am thinking about agreement and consent...
I have heard that when we use the word consent it recognizes and acknowledges the authority of the agent asking the question. Whether we consent or not... a catch 22.

So my question is Would it be better to Say...
I do not agree with your terms and conditions and decline your offer, I also waive the benefits of what you are trying to sell me...
I ask this cause the last time I was stopped... I made some mistakes and do not care to repeat them.

From: http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com

Agreement:
A meeting of minds with the understanding and acceptance of reciprocal legal rights and duties as to particular actions or obligations, which the parties intend to exchange; a mutual assent to do or refrain from doing something; a contract.

The writing or document that records the meeting of the minds of the parties. An oral compact between two parties who join together for a common purpose intending to change their rights and duties.

An agreement is not always synonymous with a contract because it might lack an essential element of a contract, such as consideration.

Consent:

Voluntary Acquiescence to the proposal of another; the act or result of reaching an accord; a concurrence of minds; actual willingness that an act or an infringement of an interest shall occur.

Consent is an act of reason and deliberation. A person who possesses and exercises sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent decision demonstrates consent by performing an act recommended by another. Consent assumes a physical power to act and a reflective, determined, and unencumbered exertion of these powers. It is an act unaffected by Fraud, duress, or sometimes even mistake when these factors are not the reason for the consent. Consent is implied in every agreement.

Parties who terminate litigation pursuant to a consent judgment agree to the terms of a decision that is entered into the court record subsequent to its approval by the court.

In the context of rape, submission due to apprehension or terror is not real consent. There must be a choice between resistance and acquiescence. If a woman resists to the point where additional resistance would be futile or until her resistance is forcibly overcome, submission thereafter is not consent.

          <p>This Day in History: on this day in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address at the dedication of the National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The 272-word speech reflected Lincoln�s redefined conviction that the Civil War was a struggle for liberty and equality for all, as one of the most memorable discourses in American history.

    The Dean Clifford- inspired REPROBATE thread...

Dean Clifford: Chris, I filed an affidavit in Brandon Court years ago that the Clown Prosecutor was a reprobate. he got pulled from the case and had to sit there with his head hanging in shame for the rest of the day while the top Crown for the city prosecuted. It was fucking hilarious. I guess I was right.

REPROBATION, eccl. law. The propounding exceptions either against facts, persons or things; as, to allege that certain deeds or instruments have not been duly and lawfully executed; or that certain persons are such that they are incompetent as witnesses; or that certain things ought not for legal reasons to be admitted. Bouvier&#39;s Law 1856.

REPROBATOR: (rep-ra-bay-tar). Scots law. Rist. A challenge to disqualify a witness or to invalidate the testimony of an objectionable witness. Also termed action of reprobator. Black&#39;s Law 9th.

APPROBATE AND REPROBATE. In Scotland this term is used to signify to approve and reject. It is a maxim quod approbo non reprobo. For example, if a testator give his property to A, and give A&#39;s property to B, A shall not be at liberty to approve of the will so far as the legacy is given to him, and reject it as to the bequest of his property to B in other words, he cannot approve and reject the will.

http://www.constitution.org/bouv/bouvier_a.htm
Bouvier&#39;s Law Dictionary, 1856 Edition - Letter A
www.constitution.org

Derek Moran: Hmmm, interesting Maxims from Black&#39;s 9th:

Quod approbo non reprobo: What I approve I do not disapprove.

..that&#39;s DEEP- yo, Pete Daoust, good MAXIM going-on here!

Excessus in re qualibet jure reprobatur communi: Excess
in anything at all is condemned by common law.

Lex reprobat moram: The law disapproves of delay.

Mora reprobatur in lege: Delay is disapproved of in law.

Pete Daoust: Any difference between ACCEPT and APPROVE ?

Nimia subtilitas in jure reprobatur: Too much subtlety in law is condemned.

Nimia subtilitas in jure reprobatur, et talis certitudo certitudinem confundit: Too great subtlety is disapproved of in law, and such certainty confounds certainty.

Simplicitas est legibus amica, et nimia subtilitas in jure reprobatur: Simplicity is a friend to the laws, and too much subtlety in law is condemned.

Derek Moran: Here&#39;s one just for &#34;YOU,&#34; Pierre/PIERRE:

Reprobata pecunia liberat solventem: Money refused releases the person paying (or offering payment).

    The WICH-GOD-I-CAN-USE-ADVICES thread :D

Now, this can be a funny thread, and I LOVE funny threads, mostly those filled with grafiiti (My graffitis :P )

Now, here�s what the LAW says :/

Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law:

so to me, it is clear that they used the word �GOD� and RECOGNIZED its supremacy, but again, I may miss the point, you know me ? :D

Let say I don�t miss the point, and this thing really means what I think it means :/

Now, I have a DUTY to find WHO is that �GOD� they are talking about, which it should be an EASY thing to do, well, it should �.NO ?? 
But I have no idea, so I thought I might ASK, in fact, it�s the ONLY logical thing to do, I have NO other options, so I ask.

And Peter MacKay seems to be the one to ask�..

Dear Peter MacKay,
After starting a process on educating myself, regarding the LAW, in Canada, I would like to ask you one question, to make sure I UNDERSTAND clearly.

The Charter says:
Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law:

So, since my INTENT is to obey the law, because everyone is to obey the law, and no one is above the law, I would like to know WHO is this �GOD� that Canada recognized the supremacy of.

I really need to know, if there is ONE god, or if you have a list of �GODS� that I can choose and pick from.

I recognize and fully accept your Oath of office, and I know you will get back to me with an answer.

Your�s Truly :D

  <div class="py-4 whitespace-pre-line">
    The Ceit HAULS ASS in court thread, and a lil&#39; Lou on Affidavits TOO...

Chris Evan: Tom Davies, I did this twice. Released on Personal Recognizance means one signed a BAIL BOND as SURETY. That is all!!! They don&#39;t just let you go because you said so, you HAVE to sign it.

Ceit Butler: Look, signing is NOT a problem if you know HOW to sign. I got out on bail in my case. Guess who told me how to sign? Dean Clifford. Sign: By:____________ RESTRICTED SIGNATURE, RESTRICTED CAPACITY

And draw a box around the entire thing...that REMOVES it from the document. (You know, I&#39;m PRETTY sure I already said this.)

Ceit Butler: As for your &#34;magic document&#34;....the Notice of Mistake is the closest you&#39;ll find, for IN court. But ONLY if you all start fucking using it properly! It&#39;s NOT just a document.

If at ANY time while you&#39;re speaking, you feel you&#39;ve stepped into their jurisdiction by accepting SURETY, you throw out a VERBAL Notice of Mistake: &#34;If I have led this court to believe that I am a paryt with SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE. and please forgive me&#34;.

And responding to &#34;You&#34; is the biggest one. Let them know right from the start that as the Sole Beneficiary of the BIRTH CERTIFICATE BOND, you wish to solely be addressed as &#34;insert regular old first name here&#34;. And ANYONE who doesn&#39;t address you by THAT NAME ONLY, EVERY time that they speak to you, you respond &#34;Are you addressing me? As the SOLE BENEFICIARY, I wish to solely be addressed as:___&#34;

Ceit Butler: Say it as MANY times as you like. (and any time that they RECESS, that resets everything so IMMEDIATELY repeat everything again when they come back!)

Make sure the verbal Notice of Mistake is the very LAST thing that you say before they finish up, so it&#39;s the LAST THING on the record and wipes clean any SURETY that may have you accidentally fumbled into.

Ceit Butler: Sign the RIGHT way at your bail hearing and get the fuck out so that you&#39;re actually able to handle things properly.

Take the disclosure, read all the LOVELY things that it states on the front, that you are agreeing to by accepting these documents.

STAPLE (so it becomes part of the document and cannot be removed) a Notice of Mistake, neatly, onto the top of the front page and MAIL THAT FUCKER BACK, as declined. 

Ceit Butler: Then you work on your first document. Notice of Questions for the Court.

Address every question that you need answered in order to UNDERSTAND the NATURE and CAUSE of these PROCEEDINGS. Also include your Affidavit of Status with this document.

Have everything nicely organized with tabs seperating each document, a cover and spiral-bound at your local copy place.

It&#39;s a LEGAL DOCUMENT...so make it fucking look like one. You don&#39;t want to be treated like a joke in court? Then don&#39;t give them ANY excuse to.

Include the Notice of Mistake in a tab marked EXHIBIT #1 in the back. It has already been submitted when you sent the DISCLOSURE back by REGISTERED MAIL (with NO return address!). Give them 10 days to respond, have your documents NOTARIZED and mail it in.

Ceit Butler: When the 10 days expire, you send them a CERTIFICATE of NON RESPONSE and OPPORTUNITY to CURE. Give them 5 ADDITIONAL days to settle this HONOURABLY. This way THEY are the ones creating CONTROVERSY.

Ceit Butler: Include ALL previously submitted documents thus far, in new tabs in the back. These (are) PROOF now.

Ceit Butler: When the 5 days expire, you send them a NOTICE of DEFAULT.

Again, everything professionally spiral-bound, tabs, covers, and type it out in the correct format. Look at samples of legal documents, pay attention to how they are laid out.

Everybody clear now?!

Ceit Butler: And make sure every new document states that UNLESS these questions are answered, you cannot UNDERSTAND the NATURE and CAUSE of these PROCEEDINGS.

Ceit Butler: Perhaps you missed this part:

&#34;You don&#39;t want to be treated like a joke in court? Then don&#39;t give them ANY excuse to.&#34;

Chris Evan: &#34;These PROOF now&#34; Ceit, what exactly do you mean by this sentence? Just that the Exhibits are now proof?

Ceit Butler: You&#39;ve mailed them to the COURT CLERK, by REGISTERED MAIL, (oh, sorry, and include copies of your postal receipts with the signature of the party who accepted them) and they are UNREBUTTED.

Ceit Butler: Other than filling up the thread with useless bullshit, destracting from the ACTUAL CONTENT, and making sure that anyone new who may be browsing will immediately dismiss the thread?

Because that&#39;s the only possible &#34;point&#34; that I can see. (She WASNT speaking to Chris Evan here)

Chris Evan: Ok...thanks. And we are Noticing the Court Clerk and NOT the Prosecuting Attorney, is this correct?

Ceit Butler: Send it the CLERK. And make sure each document also states that if the QUESTIONS are not answered, then it is you WISH/REQUIRE and DEMAND that this matter be DISCHARGED.

Ceit Butler: How about restricting the Grade-School BULLSHIT to personal chats?

I was mistakenly under the impression that you all wanted to learn something.

I am going over the steps from my case with you because I thought you were finally at levels of understanding that would allow you to grasp this.
(Posting every back in July would have been like handing a loaded shotgun to a 2 year old.)
Again, clearly mistaken.

Chris Evan: Out of curiosity, why wouldn&#39;t we send it to our adversary...the person bringing the charges?

Ceit Butler: You send it to the CLERK...the person in charge of the court file and the PUBLIC RECORD. Send a copy to the CROWN ATTORNEY as well, if you like. I had additional copies with me when I went to court. That way, if they tried to claim they had not received them, I could KINDLY provide them with one. (Aren&#39;t I nice? )

Ceit Butler: I also submitted a notorazied, colour copies, (front and back) of my BIRTH CERTIFICATE with the first document and had extra copies when I went to court.

Ceit Butler: If you act in HONOUR the entire time, then the COURT is the only one creating CONTROVERSY.

Eamonn O Brien: Rather than shouting about how one is a man... 

Ceit Butler: That&#39;s why ANY error, such as the COURT presuming that YOU are the PARTY with SURETY, you CLEARLY accept as being your fault and you ASK FORGIVENESS....because they HAVE to grant it. 

Ceit Butler: &#34;If have led this COURT to believe that I am a PARTY with SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE, and please FORGIVE me&#34;.

Ceit Butler: It&#39;s not &#34;THEIR fault&#34; that you forgot to mention that you weren&#39;t the LEGAL PERSON, they&#39;re simply operating on presumptions. The burden of correcting that error lies on you.

That&#39;s how you have to treat it.

Ceit Butler: It is the CLERK&#39;s responsibility to enter all DOCUMENTS into the file. That&#39;s why you send it there.

Ceit Butler: Yes. Now, I went to my first appearance, stated my status as the SOLE BENEFICIARY and that I wish to be solely addressed as KATHRYN.

The JUSTICE did that, no arguement, which means he just ACQUIESCED and TACITLY AGREED that I am in FACT the SOLE BENEFICIARY.

I then ordered the TRANSCRIPT and attached it as an EXHIBIT in each proceeding document as PROOF.

Ceit Butler: The JUSTICE attempted to enter a plea for me, three times, to which I responded &#34;I DO NOT CONSENT.&#34;
They&#39;ll try to trick you, just stand your ground. Do not consent, and NOTICE of MISTAKE.

(Make sure you KEEP all your ORIGINAL notarized documents. Send them colour copies.)

Ceit Butler: Correction, send everything to the PROSECUTOR&#39;s office. (Sorry guys, I&#39;m rushing here)

Ceit Butler: No problem. Things are...strange...

I wanted to get at least the bare-bone basics out there.

Lou Manotti: YOU all need to understand the power of an affidavit.

Eamonn O Brien: An unrebutted one at that Lou 

Lou Manotti: An unrebutted affidavit stands as a PUBLIC RECORD as TRUTH in LAW and COMMERCE.

Robert Cormier: Scott told me/us to study notaries.

Ceit Butler: Send them to both, CLERK and PROSECUTOR.

Ceit Butler: As a BONUS, we have an object lesson!

Eamonn O Brien, you just failed the SURETY TEST!

&#34;Please don&#39;t let one member&#39;s comments deter you from sharing Ceit. It&#39;s MUCH appreciated...&#34;

At NO point did I mention YOUR name, you just responded to &#34;you&#34; and accepted SURETY.

Try to get your mind into the habit of spotting that when it happens, and it will seve you well.

Ceit Butler: Send everything, notarized copies, by REGISTERED MAIL. No return address.

Derek Moran: &#34;[YOU] all need to understand the power of an affidavit.&#34;

Does this have anything to do with THIS Maxim-of-law, Lou?

Qui non negat fatetur. A person who does not deny
admits.

p.s.
you saw what i did there, right? 

Derek Moran: somebody on Scott&#39;s boat was pointing-out this very Maxim to me in regards to Affidavits- oh thats right, he said exactly - &#34;He who does not deny, admits&#34;...did i mention i was reminded of this Maxim on Scott&#39;s BOAT? ;)

Derek Moran: This just off Norah&#39;s page:

&#34;Norah Holloway
Someone just got a call from Dean Clifford. He was brought before the Chief Justice Chartier first thing this morning! Dean dropped his two sentence A-bomb stopped them in their tracks!

Derek Moran: Knowing Dean, &#34;his two sentence A-bomb&#34; probably included:

&#34;I AM REQUIRED TO INFORM YOU THAT FORCED COMPLIANCE TO ORDERS BY YOURSELF, AND/OR YOUR AGENTS, IS IN FACT, ACCEPTANCE of my Terms and Conditions.&#34;

Second sentence = &#34;Fellas...you&#39;re gonna want that cowbell&#34;

Ceit Butler: Because, as Lou ALSO just said early, the power lies in the fact that :&#34; An unrebutted affidavit stands as a PUBLIC RECORD as TRUTH in LAW and COMMERCE.&#34;

Ceit Butler: Silence is aquiescence. If the court does NOT rebut any of the facts stated in your affidavit, then they have TACITLY AGREED with them.

If you DO end up in the courtroom, reading your Affidavit out loud gets it on the PUBLIC RECORD. State afterwards that &#34;For the record, the COURT has tacitly agreed that I &lt;insert previous statements&gt;&#34;.

Pete Daoust: The truth of an affidavit jams their fucking lies 

Derek Moran: OOH- regarding Affidavits, on Scott&#39;s boat it was made CLEAR.....ONLY, send, the court, PHOTOCOPIES

WE keep the ORIGINAL...the court gets a PHOTOCOPY.....has to do with COPYHOLD, you dont want the court getting their hands on the ORIGINAL...the AUTHOR is the AUTHORITY...so handing over the ORIGINAL to the court is BAD - would you concur, [Ill]Lou Manotti?

Lou Manotti: only send THEM photocopies of your documents (certification unnecessary).You retain ALL original documentation.

Part 1 - Ok, here is a little something I had worked on. These are all threads in the Tender for Law,  from the opening of the page in January, up until April 30th 2013, with all comments  opened, in a pdf format.

Thanks, Admiral!

    Part 2 - ATTENTION FUTURE &#34;Scott Duncan Simu-Drones&#34;

Here is a HUGE file of TT4L, all threads, and comments opened, from November 20th, 2013, back to sometime in August 2013. More than 834 pages full of Gold nuggets, of the later days of TT4L. Enjoy!

Thanks, again, Admiral!

    Part 3 - ATTENTION FUTURE &#34;Scott Duncan Simu-Drones&#34;

Here are ALL threads posted in the TT4L, from January 2013, to November 20th, 2013. The only  &#34;catch&#34; is that not all threads, and comments are opened, :(, so a lot is &#34;missing&#34;. But still, good references here, you get to see all posts.  For what it&#39;s worth!

The Admiral is awesome! Simu-Drones, attack!

    So here are some  comments from a forum who loves me and loves to discuss what i do to try and help my people and myself understand this criminal system called Law by a foreigner called the Queen. Tell me your thoughts on this ?

Postby Burnaby49 � Sat Nov 30, 2013 9:53 pm 
The Chief&#39;s rants about his rights and status tend to be about his claimed legal status in relation to non-indians, he says nothing about any special status or position he holds within his First nations Community. Since he is not a guy to hide his light under a bushel I assume he has no special status. He is &#34;Chief&#34; because he calls himself that, not because he is actually a Band Chief.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Postby LordEd � Sat Nov 30, 2013 9:45 pm
Is there some first nations group that recognizes the chief as having some form of special status or title?

Or is he the equivalent of a janitor playing CEO in the boss&#39; chair at night before taking out the waste bin?

I think (I make no claim to any depth of knowledge about the Chief&#39;s belief) that he hangs his hat on two points. The first is that he is First Nations and so the normal laws of Canada don&#39;t apply to him. Simply put the Notary Society has no jurisdiction to regulate his activities. The second is magic incantations that mean, even though he calls himself a notary, he isn&#39;t a notary as defined by the Society. Note that last line on his Notarial Signature I copied above;

&#34;Non Domestic without Canada&#34;

I think he is trying to indicate with that line that he holds that mystical &#34;International Notary&#34; designation that Charles Holmes was babbling about at his trial. As an International Notary he is not subject to the rules of the Society of Notaries Public of British Columbia. Ron Usher told me that there is no such thing as an &#34;International Notary&#34; so I&#39;m assuming the Chief just made it up

Even assuming, arguendo, that the First Nations actually do have such a position, they would only have authority to notarize within the tribal community and for tribal members, so whoopee!!!

There is no such thing as an &#34;International Notary&#34; so he is indeed making it up. So again, big surprise. NOT!!!

These are alot of lawyers and/or some legal folks whom work in or with Law Society in British Columbia, i have met one who works closely with them and has been used in cases. They do not believe our original nations are separate, they think we are all Canadian, we are all subject to their rules of law like a Subject of her Majesty. What do you think, are you or are you a citizen of your own nation ? Where do you stand ?

    The Janick and Dean Kory inspired- HOW a MUNICIPALITY tries to SCREW YOU with INTENT and MISLEAD you with the use of their LEGALESE- thread.....

Janick Paquette: ok, I&#39;m in a little panic moment here!...I&#39;ve come to understand that this quote was scaring me because I couldn&#39;t understand the meanings of the words. Now that I see that this only applies to the taxpayer... 

Derek Moran: Uh-huh, now...whats THEIR definition of a TAXPAYER? 

Derek Moran: As an example, the City of Toronto Act 2006:

�taxpayer� means a person whose name is shown on the tax roll.

http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/Statutes/English/elaws_statutes_06c11_e.htm#BK393

Derek Moran &#34;TAXPAYER&#34; means a PERSON..... which &#34;PERSON&#34; is the City of Toronto talking about - they&#39;ve got TWO of them!

�person� includes a municipality unless the context otherwise requires;

�person� includes a municipality, a local board (extended definition) and the Crown.

Derek Moran: &#34;PERSON&#34; includes a MUNICIPALITY..... whats THEIR definition of a MUNICIPALITY?

�municipality� means a geographic area whose inhabitants are INCORPORATED;

Municipality

(2) In this Act, a reference to a municipality is a reference to its geographical area, OR, to the municipal CORPORATION, as the context requires.

Derek Moran: Do YOU, remember INCORPORATING yourself Janick.....?

Signed,
THE CHAINS Pete ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR AND MENTIONING ABOUT ;)

Janick Paquette: You&#39;re a real encyclopedia Derek! Thanks! ... So it doesn&#39;t apply to the man! Only to the person I happen to have in my pocket!

Pete Daoust: And will get DISCHARGED by its SURETY :P

    I&#39;d like to start a discussion on the effect of a lien on the legal name has on things like mortgages, cars etc. I&#39;m feeling a bit cloudy in my comprehension of a few things still....If there is a mortgage in the persons name for example, bringing the house into the trust would be opening up the private trust to the public so we don&#39;t want that. Say there is a willingness on the part of the corporation  to continue to pay the mortgage....

Does the corporation send notice the bank that it will be paying that debt monthly and that will take care of it? 
Is there anything needed to be known when it comes time to renew the mortgage (the corporation will be the customer of the bank this time)

    Quick question as I am thinking.....

First, a Drivers License is a Legal Title, correct?
Second, the Certificate of Live Birth is an Equitable Title, correct?

So, if those 2 points are true (which I think they are), when one issues a Birth Certificate (or Certificate of Live Birth) into a court file involving a Driving offense, shouldn&#39;t that collapse the trust they just set up as the legal and equitable titles were merged?

Or am I thinking wrong?....

    Bare trusts

With bare trusts the beneficiary (the person who benefits from the trust) has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income in the trust. Beneficiaries will have to pay Income Tax on income that the trust receives. They might also have to pay Capital Gains Tax and Inheritance Tax.

What is a bare trust?

A bare trust is one where the beneficiary has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income held in the trust. Bare trusts are sometimes known as &#39;simple trusts.&#39;

Someone who sets up a bare trust can be certain that the assets (such as money, land or buildings) they set aside will go directly to the beneficiaries they intend. These assets are known as &#39;trust property&#39;. Once the trust has been set up, the beneficiaries can�t be changed.

The assets are held in the name of a trustee - the person managing and making decisions about the trust. However, the trustee has no discretion over what income or capital to pass on to the beneficiary or beneficiaries.

Bare trusts are commonly used to transfer assets to minors. Trustees hold the assets on trust until the beneficiary is 18 in England and Wales, or 16 in Scotland. At this point, beneficiaries can demand that the trustees transfer the trust fund to them.
Example

Gary leaves his sister Juliet some money in his will. The money is to be held in trust. Juliet is the beneficiary and is entitled to the money and any income (such as interest) it earns. She also has a right to take possession of any of the money at any time.

This is a bare trust because Juliet is absolutely entitled to both the capital (the original money put into the trust) and the income (any interest earned).

Bare trusts and Income Tax

Trustees may receive income from investments such as bank interest, dividend income from stocks and shares or rental income from land or buildings. The beneficiary is liable for Income Tax on income received by the trust.

If you&#39;re the beneficiary and you&#39;re entitled to any income from a bare trust, you should tell your tax office. If you don�t already do so, you&#39;ll need to fill in form SA100 Self Assessment Tax Return. The beneficiary is responsible for this tax, but it may be paid for you by the trustee.

Bare trusts and Capital Gains Tax

Capital Gains Tax is a tax on the gain in the value of assets such as shares, land or buildings. A trust may have to pay Capital Gains Tax if assets are sold, given away or exchanged (disposed of) and they�ve gone up in value since being put into trust. The trust will only have to pay the tax if the assets have increased in value above a certain allowance. This allowance is known as the &#39;annual exempt amount&#39;. The assets of a bare trust are treated for tax purposes as if the beneficiary holds the trust assets in their own name. In a bare trust the beneficiary pays the tax as if they owned the assets directly.

If you&#39;re the beneficiary you must declare any chargeable gains on your personal Self Assessment tax return.

Bare trusts and Inheritance Tax

Inheritance Tax is sometimes payable if the person who put an asset into the bare trust dies within seven years of doing so. This is known as a &#39;potentially exempt transfer&#39;.

The beneficiary is responsible for this tax. You can find out more about Trusts and Inheritance Tax in the link below.

    I propose a mission for anyone who is willing to do the research. Find out whom the Imperial Government is and what documents you can find on it, either online or scanned versions. What is the difference between Imperial and the Dominion of Canada. There appears to be a very significant difference and one took over the other without anyone noticing. One holds the obligations of treaties with all the original nations, the other does not but dances around like they do, a masquerade if you will.
A group will be created in the next few days for this exact research to post up findings for anyone who take this up. I think uncovering a very big hushed up secret is about to be discovered. Anyone with documents or information lets work together.

    &#34;Notice of Mistake or Discharge...&#34;

So I received this today... It is NOT relating to my previous encounter with them. This happened 2 weeks later... (I must sound like a right troublemaker!)

I was asked to pull in due to having no tax disc on the car (The Guard actually passed me, then having seen the lack of disc, turned his lights on and pursued me along a road through a housing estate until finally catching up to me and signalling at me to pull over.)

I was close to home so I pulled into the drive. Not wanting to have the car taken from me again I gave the license when asked. He went to his car for a few mins then returned and gave me the license back stating, &#34;If you had have pulled in anywhere else I&#39;d take that car off ya&#34;... I thanked him for not doing so and they left...

My first thoughts are to issue the Notice of Mistake as I have clearly mislead An Garda Siochana into thinking I want to engage in a commercial contract with them as a party with surety. Pete Daoust will obviously opt to encourage the discharge approach :p

So any thoughts please share. I&#39;ll probably opt for the Notice but just thought I&#39;d share with the group anyway. I haven&#39;t used the NoM yet so it will be interesting to see what they say...

    Read this and you tell me, how you interpret this, it comes in two pieces. There are more and if anyone has more of these documents please forward them to me.

    the proper question:
seems a man was stopped at a fork in the road where there were two others.
the man not knowing which way to go to get somewhere was told he could only ask ONE question. one of the 2 ALLWAYS lied, while the other ALLWAYS told the truth. Well sinse the man needed to go to see the king, he couldn&#39;t ask which one told what.
(if you know the olsd story please elaborate)
What was the question he had to ask?

ok, so 2 roads and 2 parties, is 4 answers, only one is correct. So the man asked one of the parties, what way would the OTHER say to go? (the correct question).
the answer from either is ALLWAYS going to be the wrong way.

this is part of the think wrong series. discuss;

With $25 Million Bet, Silicon Valley Officially Claims Bitcoin as Its Own

12-14-2013   �   Wired.com 

  
That�s because one of the Valley�s most important venture capitalist firms, Andressen Horowitz, made the biggest bet yet on a Bitcoin company, dropping $25 million on Coinbase � a company that�s trying to make it easier for consumers and merchants to use the digital currency. 

It�s the largest-ever investment in a bitcoin company. And it�s a sign that bitcoin may be becoming a Silicon Valley phenomenon. �Bitcoin is going to be as big as the Internet,� Andressen Horowitz�s Chris Dixon told The New York Times today.

    Hello everyone,
I am fairly new to the ideas of being a trustee of the legal person identified on the birth certificate, and administering the associated account to the legal person. I have been looking at forums, watching videos, and listening to radio shows for a while now. The biggest road block for me is that everybody says do your own research on topics but nobody gives a hint to where you can search for credible sources. Right now I am concerned with why notices and claims of rights are as effective as they are and the rules/mechanics governing their use. Anybody with insight and/or suggestions on where to look would be great. Thanks!

    Hey guys, this is my first post on this page, none of you know me but I have read most of your information :) just got a quick question for anyone with a spare second. I&#39;ve just received my first two letters from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (UK tax office), the first thing I notice is that my name on both letters is in full capital letters, kind of made me laugh. The question is, do I return them to sender (no contract) or write them a letter in response asking for proof of why I am obliged to pay tax? (El Spaniardo style) Decisions decisions, this could be fun. Any info would be very much appreciated, thank you :)

    Scott on SURETY- thread.....(been lookin&#39; for this one)

THE TENDER FOR LAW � SURETY FOR IDIOTS (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve posted an article, and I&#39;ve solidified the &#34;For Idiots&#34; concept.

One of the most painful things about being on FaceBook is having to endure the fact that people with chronic Dunning�Kruger effect still think that their ignorance has the same standing as my knowledge; and they will happily state many unkind things regarding my character when I challenge their &#34;pulled-out-of-their-ass&#34; mythology.

Some don&#39;t even go that far, and will simply lie about what I said, and claim I don&#39;t post evidence. I don&#39;t have to post &#34;evidence&#34;. I&#39;m not trying to PROVE anything to you.

That said, this is not a debate centre either. You assume ALL LIABILITY when you ask to join this group. This, by default, means you have &#34;SURETY&#34;, because SURETY equals LIABILITY. I don&#39;t need to provide &#34;proof&#34; of this; as my banning you from the group should be compelling enough to show the difference between who&#39;s in charge, and who&#39;s liable.

Before we get to the actual issue of SURETY, and why you must avoid it, we must take a quick journey back in time to learn where the legalese that enjoins you came from.

Those of you who endured the content-free 1.2 decades of the Public Fool System, will remember certain things, not the least of which is Shakespeare. The plays of Shakespeare are sold to you as &#34;Olde English&#34;. In fact, it was sold as &#34;Olde English&#34; when these were first-run plays. There is a problem with this, though. Nobody ever spoke in the manner that Shakespeare wrote, and they most certainly never used the words. Shakespeare produced most of his major works between 1589 and 1613, all of which were sold as &#34;Olde English&#34;. Popular periodicals of the time show that you were often considered &#34;learned and of good taste&#34; if you could speak in this &#34;Olde English&#34;.

So let&#39;s go read some really, really Olde English.

Let&#39;s pick a really old English document, completely at random. We&#39;ll pick...The MAGNA CARTA.

A quick read of the MAGNA CARTA will swiftly reveal two things. The first is that that it&#39;s pretty readable, not backward and convoluted like a Shakespeare play. There may be a few archaic words you may need to look up (to ascertain their meanings), but it&#39;s still pretty readable, and there are no words that Shakespeare used. There&#39;s also no letter &#34;U&#34;. This is a very important fact to remember, because *spoiler alert*, when courts or legal documents refer to &#34;YOU&#34;, they are in fact, granting you SURETY in the matter. If you look at a WARRANT, or a ticket from a Policy Enforcement Officer, it will have a name and it will then refer to that name as &#34;YOU&#34; from then on. For example, &#34;JOHN Q PUBLIC, YOU have been charged with (insert bullshit offence here)&#34;.

YOU=SURETY

If you&#39;re ever in a courtroom and do not wish to have the &#34;benefit of SURETY&#34;, you have but to object to being addressed as &#34;YOU&#34;. There are many ways to do this. Dean Clifford might say, in response to being addressed as &#34;YOU&#34;, &#34;If I have led the court to believe that I am SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE. Please forgive me.&#34; (FUN FACT: A court MUST ALWAYS grant forgiveness when asked and/or requested)

Others, like myself, are a lot more succinct. For example, I might respond, &#34;FUCK YOU! You&#39;re a YOU, I&#39;m a ME! By what AUTHORITY do YOU address ME as a &#34;YOU&#34;?&#34;, because I can get away with it. The reason I can get away with it is that I UNDERSTAND the UCC as opposed to ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD which spreads mythology and bullshit about the UCC.

Now there may be a certain &#34;pretend radio&#34; talk-show host (who speaks in a manner that would suggest he is hosting a show with a dick in his mouth), who would demand &#34;proof of this&#34;, ignoring the fact that the UCC is, in fact, the proof.

Section 1, Subsection 308, of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE covers RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. This is a well-known fact, and this is how you use it.

On entering the court, you aggressively make the first motion, that being, the RESERVATION OF YOUR RIGHTS. But since you&#39;re the only one in the courtroom with ACTUAL STANDING, you can be a total dick about it. You don&#39;t RESERVE YOUR RIGHTS, you RESERVE ALL RIGHTS! Not just yours, EVERYONE&#39;s. You remove everyone else&#39;s rights and give them to yourself. WHY? Because &#34;Fuck off that&#39;s WHY!&#34; You&#39;re the only one with STANDING.

If you HOLD the power, WIELD it...don&#39;t be such a pussy! If you&#39;re entitled to ALL RIGHTS, CLAIM THEM. This is how you do it.

When the &#34;justice&#34; starts speaking, interrupt them. Say, &#34;Point of order!&#34; They will immediately be silent. At that point, state &#34;I believe I am the only party with standing, so barring objection from the court, I wish to RESERVE ALL RIGHTS now, and henceforth. Are there any objections from the court?&#34; As the court has no standing to respond, simply speak to the record as such, &#34;Let the record show that I have reserved all rights, and the court has not objected.&#34; At this point if they say anything to you, you simply say, &#34;Objection. The record shows that I have reserved all rights, and I have not granted you leave to speak. Why are you speaking?&#34;

Do the same when opposing counsel attempts to speak. You will then be posed the question, &#34;How do you wish to proceed in this matter?&#34; for that is the one question a slave has the right to ask. What is their master&#39;s wish?

You&#39;ll recall in other articles and comments, the levels of the caste system and how they give instructions.

NOBILITY (KINGS AND QUEENS) EXPRESS THEIR &#34;WISHES&#34;.

ADMIRALTY ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS BY REQUESTING, ADDRESSING THEIR SUBORDINATES AS &#34;MR&#34;.

GENERALS GIVE ORDERS.

Now even the talk-show host who sounds like he&#39;s got a dick in his mouth, won&#39;t &#34;demand proof&#34; of the fact that if you have all the rights, and everybody else has none, you are CLEARLY the KING. So you are going to have to learn to give instruction by expressing your wishes. This is why they are asking how you &#34;wish to proceed&#34;. Courts grant and test your SOVEREIGNTY all the time. You simply have to listen to the words they are using. At this time you may respond, &#34;I wish to prove to some ass-wipe who sounds like he&#39;s got a dick in his mouth, the things I know, so I wish to go to trial PRO SE. But I wouldn&#39;t recommend this...I would simply wish the case to be dismissed.

If they say anything else besides &#34;I agree, case dismissed&#34;, you exercise your AUTHORITY by questioning. MASTERS QUESTION, SLAVES ANSWER. For instance if a &#34;justice&#34; said anything except &#34;I agree. Case dismissed,&#34; you question why they are even speaking. &#34;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll recall Mr. (insert justice&#39;s name here) that at the beginning of these proceedings I explicitly reserved all rights, including yours. Have I not made my wishes clear?&#34;

Always remember to respond in the form of a question. A question serves the dual-purpose of establishing your authority, and negating the possibility of UNDERSTANDING; because if you UNDERSTAND, you accept SURETY.

As stated before, the most powerful of these questions is, &#34;Who are you?&#34; UNDERSTANDING cannot be presumed until that question is answered.

Above all, questioning deflects SURETY.

Quite possibly one of the most useful documents I have ever published is my NOTICE OF MISTAKE for Dean. This is a useful, powerful document that also instantly removes SURETY. I framed it in such a way that you can replace the name &#34;Dean Clifford&#34; with your name, and you can make a pad of these things. Have lots of copies to hand out to friends and opposing counsel. Hell the court clerk loves these things too...make sure the court clerk has one as well. Just make sure you UNDERSTAND what the document says. Read it carefully and understand what the words mean, because you will be challenged. And remember, the NOTICE by its very nature, presents several questions.

Do not permit the proceedings to move forward without these questions being answered!

Because so many people ask for it, transcribed here is the copy of THE ROGUESUPPORT NOTICE OF MISTAKE.

***Begin NOTICE OF MISTAKE

NOTICE OF MISTAKE

In the matter of SURETY for the LEGAL NAME, I believe that there has been a
MISTAKE as the SOLE BENEFICIARY has been INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED as the
accused. If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR
SUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led the COURT to believe
by responding to �You� and or �DEAN CLIFFORD� and/or SUCH OTHER
IDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am the PARTY
WITH SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE and please forgive
me.

As I have no knowledge of who �You� and or �DEAN CLIFFORD� and/or SUCH
OTHER IDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, I RESPECTFULLY
ASK; by WHAT AUTHORITY is the COURT ADDRESSING me as such?
As the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) has been deposited into the COURT,
WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I, as the SOLE BENEFICIARY of the
TRUST have any SURETY in this matter?

As the GOVERNMENT is the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY on the SURETY BOND
(BIRTH CERTIFICATE), with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL
NAME, WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE for the
LEGAL NAME. WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE and
have ANY SURETY with respect to the LEGAL NAME?

WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a
TRUSTEE or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN?

WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have of any WARRANT OF AGENCY for the
principal?

WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that there has been any meeting of the
minds, any PROPER NOTICE given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or
that I have ANY INTENT to CONTRACT in this matter?

As such, I am returning your OFFER, DECLINED, for immediate DISCHARGE and
CLOSURE.
AUTHORISED BY:

***End NOTICE OF MISTAKE

If you truly UNDERSTAND what this document says and/or does, this is one of the most powerful documents you can wield in court. If you have the Dunning�Kruger effect you will likely go to jail. Used properly the NOTICE OF MISTAKE will ALWAYS remove any real or implied SURETY the court believes you may have.

You will notice the court always refers to &#34;belief&#34;. When I say belief is evil, it is not just a disparaging remark against adults with &#34;imaginary friends&#34; (which they totally deserve), it is yet another example of why this statement is profoundly true. All belief is evil.

You are taught from childhood to &#34;respect belief&#34;, and are constantly reinforced with the really dumb freedom that it is your &#34;right to believe what you want&#34;. If I had the authority and/or power to remove just one right from humanity, and no more, the right to &#34;believe&#34; would be the one that I would eradicate. In all my years of studying, and being part of the Nobility, the curtailing of this one &#34;RIGHT&#34; would exponentially increase quality of life for all humanity. I calculate it would take two generations for it to &#34;stick&#34;.

Belief is the end of questioning. Belief is intellectual bankruptcy, and is the exact opposite of knowledge. You will never question if you &#34;believe&#34;.

Let&#39;s leap back to the 1500&#39;s to Shakespeare. This is where the concept of addressing somebody as &#34;YOU&#34; indicated the assignment of SURETY. No writings before this contained any such logistic mechanisms. Don&#39;t &#34;believe me&#34;...go look for yourself. Go look at the MAGNA CARTA yourself; and ask yourself why there&#39;s no &#34;YOU&#34; before Shakespeare. And ask yourself why the MAGNA CARTA, in all its current published forms, no longer has, &#34;To do right by Alexander&#34;.

There may be three readers amongst you who understand what I just said there, and all of them are Scottish I guarantee you.

In any courtroom proceeding in the western world, SURETY IS PRESUMED, and it must be deflected from you. As a &#34;justice&#34; is not a PERSON under the law, the only PARTY that can ACCEPT SURETY is the PARTY making the CLAIM.

There may be certain readers who talk like they have a dick stuck in their mouth, who will demand proof of this...and so I direct you to the Rules of Civil Procedure (wherever you are) to look up SECURITY FOR COSTS.

Let&#39;s zoom back to the present (so we can get as far away from belief as possible) where the word &#34;YOU&#34; is part of the English language, as are the titles, &#34;Mr.&#34;, &#34;Miss&#34;, and &#34;Mrs.&#34;. All of these titles and means of addressing you, are in fact, assigning and/or presuming SURETY...yes, on YOU. The easiest mnemonic exercise you can do to make deflecting these titles second nature is to replace the titles &#34;Mr.&#34;, &#34;Miss&#34;, or &#34;Mrs.&#34; with the word, &#34;bitch&#34;, in your head; and to respond as if they had addressed you as &#34;bitch&#34;, because being addressed as &#34;Mr.&#34;, &#34;Miss&#34;, or &#34;Mrs.&#34; is doing exactly that.

As for the word &#34;YOU&#34;, think of that as a tennis ball which must be served back. Assert your AUTHORITY by questioning whenever they address you as &#34;YOU&#34;; &#34;Are YOU addressing ME?&#34; If they&#39;re stupid enough to say yes, or even to imply the affirmative, be like that guy who talks like he has a dick in his mouth and demand proof; &#34;By what authority do YOU address me as a PARTY OF SURETY?&#34;...or something along those lines. Your only objective is to serve the &#34;YOU&#34; back to them.

So that&#39;s today&#39;s word, &#34;SURETY&#34;. It&#39;s something you don&#39;t want, and I&#39;ve just shown you how to give it back. I&#39;d like to thank my involuntary guests, Dean Clifford, and the guy that talks like he&#39;s got a dick in his mouth. Since I was so liberal with their identities, I certainly have no problem putting in a free plug for a &#34;pretend radio&#34; show.

So here&#39;s a link to Dean Clifford talking about family court rules or something...hosted by a guy who sounds like he&#39;s got a dick in his mouth. And before Pierre thinks I&#39;ve &#34;soft-balled this one in there&#34; for him, I&#39;m now going to presumptively say, &#34;Yes Pierre, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s Dean&#39;s dick he&#39;s sucking&#34;.

    I was just on the phone with Robert Cormier... who&#39;d drunk-dialed me. In his slurred ramblings he made up some shit about &#34;heroin&#34; and me.

...yes. I supposedly said I was an ex heroin user, and he &#34;can&#39;t find the post&#34; because his &#34;computer is old&#34;.

When I pointed out that he was talking out of his ass, he DARED say the words &#34;I&#39;m not buyin it&#34;.

Like heroin through his veins, he felt a sharp tingling sensation followed by... 

BANNED!

I was unaware that this needed explaining, but:

You don&#39;t get to make up stories about me Being a heroin addict (Seriously? I need to explain this?).

and

YOU don&#39;t get to imply I am lying about shit YOU make up.

... I really needed to explain that? You people wonder why I have such contempt for you.

So, anyway. That happened...

    Scott on the CHILDREN&#39;S AID SOCIETY FRAUD- thread.....

THE TENDER FOR LAW � CHILDREN&#39;S AID SOCIETY [C.A.S] FOR IDIOTS (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

This article is what we like to call an &#34;emergency article&#34; in as much as Dean Clifford has publicly and blatantly lied about family services and the law. Before we get started we are going to refer to the JURISDICTION I am most familiar with. You will find mirrors of this in any JURISDICTION that uses a world reserve currency.

If you live in Buttfuck Montana I will not be able to point you to the ACT and/or STATUTE that says what I am going to show you here.

http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/English/elaws_statutes_90c11_e.htm

The URL above will point you to the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO so you can sing along...

Before I start let&#39;s review a few LEGAL DEFINITIONS. Those who have been studying the Maxims of Law will be familiar with the Maxim that says, &#34;The inclusion of one thing is the exclusion of everything else.&#34; Like all good LEGAL documents I&#39;m going to give away the answer right at the beginning and explain why this is true.

Every one who has been a victim of the CHILDREN&#39;S AID SOCIETY has been profoundly aware that FRAUD is occurring, and has been unaware of how to identify this FRAUD. In order to have a child removed from a mother and/or father&#39;s custody an ORDER must be issued from the court that cites this very ACT. There are exceptions to this RULE (imminent physical threat to a child, WARRANT from a JUSTICE OF THE PEACE inter alia), but that&#39;s not what we are covering here. In this writing I am only going to focus on the long, drawn-out, cash-producing process laughingly called family law.

In every ACT and STATUTE, words are defined in the context of that ACT and/or STATUTE. If the word &#34;light&#34; is defined in a STATUTE as &#34;darkness&#34;, then in the context of that STATUTE, light means darkness. A &#34;JUSTICE&#34; orders the kidnapping (and it is kidnapping) and/or alienation of a child with an ORDER in the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO. So let&#39;s look at the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO. What does &#34;ORDER&#34; mean in the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO? Let&#39;s go see the interpretations section and its definitions....

�ORDER� INCLUDES a REFUSAL to make an ORDER; (�arr�t�, ordre et ordonnance�)...WHAT?

...just looking through the ACT to see if there&#39;s a bit more detail here...nope, that&#39;s it. That&#39;s all it says. I assume the parties who drafted this ACT were never taught that you should never use the word you&#39;re defining in a definition.

In THE TENDER FOR LAW our standard operating procedure is to look up every single word, even if you think you know what it means; and in every case it always turn out that you don&#39;t. So let&#39;s go through that sentence, one word at a time. In our fresh new definition of &#34;ORDER&#34; we are &#34;INCLUDING&#34; something, which in legalese means we are EXCLUDING everything else. In this case we are including a REFUSAL(?) How can you include a refusal? (hey don&#39;t look at me...I didn&#39;t write this...I&#39;m just telling you what it says)

Since refusal is not defined in this ACT we&#39;ll have to step up to a more general level. Let&#39;s see what Black&#39;s Law 9th Edition has to say about the word &#34;refusal&#34;:

&#34;An opportunity to accept or reject something before it is offered to others; the right or privilege of having this opportunity.&#34;...well, there&#39;s a privilege worth waiving! In fact I dare say that of all the privileges and benefits one would wish to waive, this should at least be in your top five. Dean Clifford and the guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth (&#34;How do I sound&#34;? - Tony Butros, HOW TO WITH DEAN CLIFFORD-Ep13 Family Law www.blogtalkradio.com) are selling this as a benefit.

In fact, they&#39;re asking you to beg for it when they tell you to use APPLICATIONS and MOTIONS (...Yeh, you like that don&#39;t &#39;ya bitch!).

Rather than begging for your own victimization, a little effort tearing this apart will serve you much better. Since we&#39;re talking about ORDERS and MAKING ORDERS let&#39;s take a quick peek at the word &#34;MAKE&#34; since we have Black&#39;s Law lying open here...

MAKE, according to Black&#39;s Law 9th Edition, &#34;To legally perform, as by executing, signing, OR delivering (a document) (to make a contract)&#34;

Oh look, they use the word &#34;OR&#34;! Don&#39;t you just love it when they give you a selection? Always remember legalese does NOT actually &#34;lie&#34;, it simply presumes you know what the words mean (as a CIVILIAN! HAR! Oh, I slay me!).

So when a &#34;JUSTICE&#34; MAKES an ORDER he gets a selection from the &#34;bullshit buffet&#34; that is the LAW, but he can only pick one, OR the other. Neither of these options actually apply to YOU. By ACCEPTING the ORDER you are in fact, EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS to &#34;BENEFIT&#34; from it, before everyone else can. Yes, you are accepting SURETY before anyone else gets a chance; and while I&#39;m not one to tell you how to run your affairs, I personally think that that would be a MISTAKE! And we all know what to do about MISTAKES.

Now I want you to &#34;fire up&#34; that little lump of protoplasm you laughingly call a brain, and ask yourself, &#34;Which makes more sense? Begging to be part of the JURISDICTION and all of its &#34;BENEFITS&#34; or following the Number 1 Rule of the Universe (Scott is ALWAYS right! Especially as regards LAW). Lawyers used to come to me when they got in over their heads, and I was shoved A LOT of payola under the table for my services. Single mothers reading this know how to express their gratitude. You may APPLY to Tara for the opportunity to provide remuneration.

So let&#39;s go through this fascinating definition one more time, translated to laymen&#39;s terms:

In the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO a &#34;JUSTICE&#34; will issue an opportunity to ACCEPT a BENEFIT before everyone else. So basically ORDER in this context actually OFFERS YOU the RIGHT TO DECLINE. I guarantee that none of you who have had your children stolen, DECLINED that ORDER. In fact I dare say you ACCEPTED it. That would be a MISTAKE.

Issuing a NOTICE OF MISTAKE will correct this, because another Maxim of Law says, &#34;That which can be done, can be undone&#34;. Serving by registered mail a modified NOTICE OF MISTAKE to all participating PARTIES, will remedy this MISTAKE.

And now we will cover our new &#34;word of the day&#34;, &#34;PETITION&#34;:

PETITION, according to Black&#39;s Law 9th Edition, &#34;A formal written request presented to a court or other official body.&#34;

Those few of you who actually have a fucking clue who I am, know that among my many titles is ADMIRAL. I exercise my RIGHTS and DUTIES strictly through ADMIRALTY, so I totally know what I&#39;m talking about here. I, as an ADMIRAL, have TRUSTEES SERVING me. I do not bark ORDERS at my TRUSTEES. I only do that to my inferiors. My TRUSTEES are most certainly NOT my inferiors. When I need a task performed for AQUILAE I REQUEST. Returning to the definition of PETITION you will see that this is also a request. I therefore PETITION my TRUSTEES to execute tasks on behalf of the TRUST. TRUSTEES do not serve an ADMIRAL; an ADMIRAL SERVES HIS TRUSTEES. The &#34;payment&#34; for this &#34;service&#34; is the TRUSTEE&#39;S OATH to GRANT ALL MY REQUESTS. It is the COURT&#39;s DUTY to do the same.

This group&#39;s name &#34;THE TENDER FOR LAW&#34; is actually a translation to layman&#39;s terms of &#34;THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER&#34;. They mean the same thing. So naturally money comes into the picture. Remember our group&#39;s Maxim...&#34;Follow the money&#34;. In this particular case we don&#39;t want to follow any money, we want to stop the flow of money.

All of you have heard the old adage, &#34;The buck stops here.&#34; Translated to legalese, &#34;the buck stops here&#34; = &#34;NON-NEGOTIABLE&#34;. In the construction of our PETITION we are going to contain, in its body, a cessation of negotiation. When dissecting documents that have a financial interest, we have learned that documents signed by a &#34;PERSON&#34; are considered NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS under the LAW.

Therefore in our PETITION, the first words that appear should be NON-NEGOTIABLE. This is similar to putting &#34;WITHOUT PREJUDICE&#34; on the top of a document. NEGOTIATE does not mean bargain or haggle, it means to EXECUTE a financial transaction. NON-NEGOTIABLE literally means &#34;the buck stops here&#34;. Reading through Black&#39;s Law will show you numerous types of petitions, and reading them in the context demonstrated here will make these petitions very, very clear...even a chick can do it.

At this point I would like everyone to know that I DO NOT provide LEGAL service; I only point you in the right direction. Therefore I cannot draw up a petition for you as I did with the NOTICE OF MISTAKE. NOTICE OF MISTAKE existed in the real world before I typed up any document regarding it. Therefore I was quoting, which means I have not stepped outside of any LEGAL restriction. When The second I issue a petition you can bet your sorry, incompetent asses I&#39;ll be quoting it here. Until that happens though, you&#39;d best use the comments section to ask any questions you may have. For the sake of your children do not listen to Dean and the guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth; they are deliberately misleading you! When you discover this is true (and you will if you listen to them), you are welcomed to board any AQUILAE vessel and beg me for forgiveness where I promise there will be a loyal and capable TRUSTEE standing by to kick you in the face, and toss you overboard.

So post your questions and keep on topic. As this is the most important thread, our fun banter is not permitted here!

...except when I do it.

ALERT: Government is HIDING BUSINESS LISTINGS which reveal the courts as COMMERCIAL.

I was in the Dunn and Bradstreet listings to get the listing showing that a Supernumerary (Justice) is different than a judge. Its account is a business entity called &#34;JUSTICE&#34;. When you look it up, the listing USED to say:

GOVERNMENT OF ONTARIO Operating As JUSTICE. It VANISHED when I refreshed the page. EVERY OTHER PROVINCE has vanished. MANITOBA seems to be in tact still. I guess they forgot about that province

I ScreenCapp&#39;d the Manitoba listing, in case that vanishes too.

One of the key components of the Noble Lie, is the useful imaginary friend they make to give &#34;chosen&#34; people, all the rights. (She&#39;s the Queen, because GOD said so!) This is why I seem particularly aggressive to the religious (Especially &#34;Christians&#34;). It&#39;s embarrassing when I see people say &#34;All of it is a constructed lie&#34; and then refuse to believe that the religious part is NOT part of the Noble Lie.

THIS, is a TENDER FOR LAW.

Let&#39;s look at the LEGAL aspects of this. (Legal=Commerce)
Commerce. You sell TRUST, for FIAT CURRENCY? REALLY?

This is where the term &#34;sold out&#34; came from. The 13 Colonies spawned the term. EVERYONE knew who they were and they understood Jurisdiction. It&#39;s why they left the Banker&#39;s dominion called &#34;Europe&#34; behind.

TRUST LAW IS THE HIGHEST LAW

DON&#39;T SELL ITS VALUE TO LOWER LAW!

The court offers you the right to claim sovereignty IN THEIR JURISDICTION, WITH FULL SOVEREIGN STATUS all the time. There&#39;s a catch; you MUST wait for them to offer it.

YOU don&#39;t know what the word &#34;belligerent&#34; means, do you?

When a court says you are a &#34;belligerent defendant&#34; (That&#39;s a NOUN; for the retarded people who THOUGHT they knew what it meant), what are they saying?

    Scott on the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE- thread.....

THE TENDER FOR LAW � THE UCC FOR IDIOTS (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

THIS ALSO SERVES AS PART II of ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD (OPPF)

As promised, I am now going to cover the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE (or UCC, for you idiots who type with your thumbs.)

FUCK! Myths about THIS shit, sure has �done the rounds�, hasn&#39;t it? No more myths have been generated, out of a piece of regulation, than the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE!

The dumbed-down, but very accurate, explanation is that the UCC is a standardized LEGAL mechanism, to resolve disputes in commerce, where such commerce utilizes the world reserve currency.

At the moment, the world reserve currency is the US DOLLAR. This doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s American law, but it most certainly covers the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA and all the US shores and waterways.

ITS DEFAULT ROLE IS TO DETERMINE JURISDICTION

If you watched Money as Debt III, you saw a brief explanation as to WHY gold became a world currency. It was universally accepted, around the world.

The UCC provides this very same function by being the very LAW you TENDERED when you used the US DOLLAR. This effectively means the UCC covers the UNITED STATES and any JURISDICTIONS, real or implied, which can and/or do use the US DOLLAR.

In order to make use of the UCC, you must either be in the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, and/or in one of the waters, shores or tributaries of the UNITED STATES, and/or conducting business in US DOLLARS.

I, for one, love the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE. If you have a fleet of ships and you do business in AMERICAN DOLLARS, and don&#39;t have any debt, you&#39;re pretty much as free as a human being can get in 2013.

If there is anyone that says the UCC is anything else, they are, in fact, lying to you. The purpose behind the UCC is to have COMMON INTERNATIONAL LAW regarding COMMERCE. ABOVE ALL;ITS DEFAULT ROLE IS TO DETERMINE JURISDICTION!

...idiots. (Yes, as a matter of fact I DO have to say that! FUCK OFF!)

The UCC allows certain presumptions regarding accounting that would simply be impractical in a corporate environment. The fact that roles are clearly defined, and MARITIME ADMIRALTY LAW is heavily integrated, makes owning a ship, or even better, a fleet of ships, a very liberating idea, for the UCC protects you. The UCC guarantees that other users of THE TENDER FOR LAW that offered this JURISDICTION, will protect your interests by presumption.

This whole �Dean arrest thing� has distracted me from my larger goal, and now I have to stop and dumb things down. I certainly hope my explanation of the UCC is clear enough.

Now ponder how stupid a CLAIM against such �constructs� actually is.
OK, you know what?...you&#39;re all too stupid...I&#39;m going to have to explain it.

Let&#39;s cover a few fundamentals. I&#39;ll try not to use large words so the �BELIEVERS� won&#39;t get confused.

A TRUST IS NOT A PERSON.

A GOVERNMENT IS NOT A PERSON, AND

A JUDICIARY IS NOT A PERSON.

A human that is registered with the NON-PERSON GOVERNMENT IS A PERSON.

A human, and that stripper they fucked last year and has since squirted out a NEW human, and THEREFORE, said NEW human is registered with the NON-PERSON GOVERNMENT IS A PERSON. (That&#39;s what you get for fucking strippers)

A CORPORATION IS A PERSON.

ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD poses as a �TRUST�. A TRUST cannot make a CLAIM. Only a PERSON can make a CLAIM.

The GRANTORS of the TRUST have NO STANDING to make a CLAIM once the TRUST is commissioned. They have no more power to do so than the guy, whose signature is on a Ten Dollar bill, has the AUTHORITY to tell you how to spend it.

ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD, and their ilk, will happily talk as EXPERTS on the UCC, and I&#39;m pretty sure NONE of them has actually used the UCC.

So, let&#39;s do a side-by-side comparison as to who is more qualified to speak on this subject:

I, unlike OPPF and �FREELOADERS-ON-THE-LAND�, have actual VALUE. As I type this the general consensus of the LEGAL AND BANKING SYSTEM says that I can, without question, UNDERWRITE half a Billion Dollar&#39;s worth of BONDS converted to MONEY OF EXCHANGE. Think about that. On a whim, I could inject half a Billion Dollars into the economy. This means that unless you use those dollars to purchase my value, the entire net worth of the country will drop by half a Billion Dollars.

If you think it&#39;s frightening that one privileged man wields the power to do this sort of thing, pat yourself on the back because that is the proper response. Ethics is the only thing that stops me from doing that. But that doesn&#39;t really help much in COMMERCE. An ethical guy with a gun, in the end, is still just a guy with a gun....

�.Enter the UCC.

The UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE in COMMERCE, only recognizes whatever currency is the world reserve currency. This of course is the US DOLLAR. This means that every other currency touched by the INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND is simply �acting� as a US DOLLAR (or part thereof).
Muammar Gaddafi was wiped off the face of the earth, because he dared point out that the world&#39;s currencies are propping-up the dead, hollowed-out carcass that is the UNITED STATES. He raised the point that, according to the little, green book that got him into office, He was pretty sure that LIBYA&#39;S economic wealth was to go to its people.

I hear people stating that the war on LIBYA was ILLEGAL. Sadly it wasn&#39;t. The UCC made it perfectly LEGAL.

LAW IS A TRUST. According to the TRUST, Gaddafi&#39;s attempt to change the currency was a BREACH OF THAT TRUST.

THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE can be viewed as the grand, de facto law that exists where no other de facto law exists.

Therefore according to IMF TREATIES, if there&#39;s no law at a particular place, the UCC is DEEMED to be the de facto law.

You will notice that there is nothing to LIEN or FORECLOSE ON in the UCC. UCC is a �legal traffic cop�, directing traffic to its appropriate JURISDICTION.

Treating a TRUST like a PERSON makes any further documents produced as a result, FRAUD. Such documents are OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT.

In short, ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD is, by its very nature, based on an ILLEGAL concept.

...but that&#39;s not the worst of it. UCC, like any OTHER TRUST is based on CONSENT. Let&#39;s look into LEGAL UTOPIA! We needn&#39;t bother with silly things like consent. IT&#39;S LEGAL PARADISE! First we must get into the right �headspace�.

Since all of you like to form uninformed opinions of me, and what a bad man I am, I&#39;ll put this next scenario in the context of �me�, because your self-created loathing of me will allow you to accept this concept, in your empty little heads.

SO, Imagine if you will that I, the KEEPER OF THE AQUILAE TRUST, decided that I wanted to do something FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, because you&#39;re too stupid to do it yourself. With the arrogant presumption that I even have STANDING to do so, I, without your CONSENT, make a DECLARATION that you get a �chunk of the world&#39;s wealth�; and to ENFORCE that I drafted some AWESOME LAWS, as I do not �believe� (belief is the only thing that would cause a rational human being to think this way) you are capable of managing your own affairs...

...hey wait, this is starting to sound familiar. But I&#39;m not like the GOVERNMENT, I know what&#39;s best for you! I&#39;m just here to help; and anybody who doesn&#39;t want that help is clearly a �hater�, and are jealous... maybe even criminals and psychopaths. Why, anybody who doesn&#39;t want my help is mentally ill. That&#39;s safe to say! In fact, I&#39;d better amend my awesome laws so that I may lovingly and humanely dispose of these mentally ill.

Got the picture?

GOOD.

Now just replace �me� with those �three guys� in ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD, and that is what is being sold to you. I cannot make this any clearer.

I have just explained what the UCC is. If you think it&#39;s anything else, you&#39;re �making shit up�.

I use the UCC daily. AQUILAE has points-of-presence in CANADA, THE UNITED STATES, SINGAPORE, SCOTLAND and ICELAND. So anybody who dares say they know more about the UCC is publicly declaring that I am LEGALLY INCOMPETENT TO MANAGE A TRUST, which is DEFAMATORY; and I deal with that in MY JURISDICTION, and there&#39;s a nice �legal traffic cop� that says I can. People who want to continue spreading bullshit may find themselves on my �LEGAL AUTOPSY TABLE� where they are used as a live example...

...Because ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD has a lot more than the UCC. I could show mercy right now and let this FRAUD die as it is; and even though I made some grandiose promises about this document&#39;s horrible fate, I remind you all that mercy is the mark of a GREAT MAN!

...The problem is, I&#39;m just a GOOD man.

In my next major post I shall cover the procedural FRAUD within the TRUST itself as laid-out in its CHARTER DOCUMENTS.

Watch how it writhes in pain. * maniacal giggling is permitted *

    Scott on INSURANCE- thread.....

ATTENTION FUTURE &#34;Scott Duncan Simu-Drones&#34;!
(I Totally love that! )

THE TENDER FOR LAW � APPOINTED ARTICLE - INSURANCE FOR THE INEPT - By APPOINTMENT of Gail Blackman (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

One of the great things about being in a law forum, run by a prorogued noble, is that you have the unique opportunity of posing the right question and always getting a near-magical answer; which causes something to flip in that little lump of protoplasm you laughingly call a brain.

...and everything becomes clear.

How any of you are kicking yourselves because you didn&#39;t know what THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER means?

Well, this one&#39;s no different.

Readers of this forum will notice I have a particular distaste for the Abrahamic religions. I have to tell you, it&#39;s not going to let up in this article, because this article is about INSURANCE. We all know about INSURANCE. If you&#39;re driving, you HAVE to have INSURANCE. Hell if you want safe harbour anywhere, the harbour-master will demand that your boat have INSURANCE.

So let&#39;s look at the word. First the prefix &#34;in&#34;. What does the prefix &#34;in&#34; mean? Well, look at all the words that I use to describe all of you - Inept, incompetent, incapable, insecure, insincere, indefensible, inexcusable, ineffective...I&#39;m sure you guys are getting the idea. And the rest of the word just refers to surety. In the end it all refers to surety and accounting -- nothing else.

In order to completely remove surety (insure) another PERSON must take responsibility for your actions. This concept is in fact, FRAUD. Here in reality it&#39;s not what you know, it&#39;s what you can prove. I&#39;ve leveraged that concept all my life. Let&#39;s assume as I type this, I KNOW I am responsible for at least three homicides; but can you prove it? Let&#39;s say you could. What if you decided I committed those homicides for the right reasons, and you decided that you were going to &#34;do the time&#34; for me. And while I certainly don&#39;t want to discourage people from doing really nice things for me, you serving the sentence for me does not actually absolve me of the responsibility. You&#39;re just taking the proverbial &#34;hit&#34; for me. Allowing you to do that time for me would be unethical in ways I won&#39;t even cover here, yet that morally repugnant concept is played out daily - with INSURANCE.

Another PERSON assumes SURETY for your actions. This is why INSURANCE companies still refer to natural events/disasters as &#34;Acts of God&#34;. A delusional Christian fuck-wit brings this up weekly as though their INSURANCE policy validates the existence of God.

This is one of many uses for the Abrahamic religions. They socially-engineer concepts like INSURANCE so they are elevated from blatant unethical FRAUD to a necessity for daily life, and they will say you are foolish, or a bad person, for not having INSURANCE.

How did they manage to pull that off? In my above homicide scenario, I explained the FRAUD in plain, unambiguous terms. Only the most ethically bankrupt amongst you will miss the point. The reason it has never occurred to you, is because of everybody&#39;s favourite zombie-rape-baby, Jesus H. Christ.

As a little side note to Christians, as it may not have occurred to them, it&#39;s NOT OK to impregnate women in their sleep! This should seem obvious but you&#39;re a Christian -- so you can never be too sure.

Anyway...where was I? ...Jesus the zombie-rape-baby...right.

The whole Christian doctrine revolves around the assertion that Jesus-zombie-rape-baby died for your sins. Only Christians seem to be able to determine what these &#34;sins&#34; are; however, apparently having sex is a sin, and murder is a sin; hell, even thought crimes (impure thoughts) are sins. But don&#39;t you worry, you horrible, wretched thing, Jesus the zombie-rape-baby has died for your sins. And if you can believe that, well then, Bob&#39;s Universal All-encompassing mega INSURANCE policy (don&#39;t forget to read the fine print) is for you (Act now, &#39;cause you know we can&#39;t do this all day)!

One of the things all of you have to realize, especially the Christians, is that the entire history of the world was rewritten in the 1500&#39;s. Shakespeare was introduced to inject &#34;legalese&#34; into the vernacular of the Angols. Translate any copy of THE MAGNA CARTA and you will notice no legalese ever appears in it. And my personal favourite is Christians that wave around the KING JAMES BIBLE. I can&#39;t make this any simpler. It says right on the fucking cover who is scamming you!

Everything in the nobility is executed by APPOINTMENT, from social engineering projects like the KING JAMES BIBLE, to Dunhill cigarettes, because the Queen likes a certain type of tobacco. These products and &#34;services&#34; are executed with the presumption that they are in compliance with the Sovereign&#39;s wishes, and notice is given on the product itself that it was created by APPOINTMENT, by the entity who appointed it.

The KING JAMES BIBLE was APPOINTED by King James. The technology had reached the point were mass production of print medium was possible. This meant that social engineering that normally relied on &#34;word-of-mouth&#34; could now have rigid change-control introduced. This meant the instructions for selling your daughter into slavery was consistent throughout the Commonwealth. This also introduced the concept of an imaginary rape baby taking responsibility for all the bad shit you do. Seriously that&#39;s what you &#34;bought&#34;. There are people reading this who believe this to be true.

The whole &#34;dying&#34; thing is also a scam. That&#39;s the zombie part. Zombie-rape-baby-Jesus supposedly came back to life three day&#39;s after he died. Where&#39;s the sacrifice? He wasn&#39;t even out of commission long enough for his relatives to start fighting over his stuff. The very notion that &#34;Jesus died for your sins&#34; is nullified by the fact that he stopped being dead. He didn&#39;t die for your sins, he had a bad weekend for your sins...and he slept through most of it. OK, I&#39;m really Christian-bashing here. Let&#39;s split the difference and say, &#34;Jesus was sightly inconvenienced for your sins.&#34;

I understand he was inconvenienced on a long weekend, too, which makes it really...bad?

I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m really trying to ascertain how this equals all the bad shit you do. You Christians will claim this Jesus guy will absolve me of any wrongdoing because of the &#34;sacrifice&#34; he made, but I&#39;m not seeing where this sacrifice is. I&#39;m not mentioning this because I&#39;m looking for convincing. I&#39;m from that same group of guys that made this book, and that&#39;s where the argument becomes moot.

I can&#39;t stress this enough, but I&#39;m one of the guys that&#39;s in on the scam.

You&#39;ll constantly hear me say, &#34;Stop studying the clubhouse rules, because you&#39;re not in the club.&#34; I&#39;m descended from the founders of the club. I would rather live in poverty than to live off your labour; although my position on this has been on a sliding scale of late. Of all the clubhouse rules, the bible in any form, should be avoided at all costs. It should be fought at every possible opportunity, and should be met with all the ridicule and contempt you can throw at it...

...because it deserves no less. It is an ethically bankrupt FRAUD...just like INSURANCE.

If you think I can make Christianity sound retarded, wait until I cover INSURANCE.

So let&#39;s zoom back to when you were 16-years-old. You can&#39;t vote, you can&#39;t drink, there&#39;s a question mark as to whether you can legally have sex according to where you reside, but there is one thing you can do -- you can drive.

Hence you engage in the ego-building act of getting &#34;permission to learn&#34; from the government. So, at the whim of a paper-pusher who couldn&#39;t get a job in the real world, you will hopefully be given permission to learn; and you will have proof that you have this permission when you produce a LEARNER&#39;S PERMIT. And so every good Christian goes through this RIGHT OF PASSAGE where they are granted permission to learn. Gee willikers, it&#39;s awfully swell that the government gave you permission to learn, huh?

But you&#39;re just sixteen, remember? You&#39;re not old enough to know of the real pitfalls of life...like dames and broads trying to play you for a sap (I&#39;m laughing as I type this, because 1950&#39;s movie-speak is almost as retarded as this generations&#39;s pop-culture slang).

Now in order to exercise your newly-acquired &#34;permission to learn&#34; you&#39;re going to need a vehicle, perhaps a car, which is a contraction of carriage...which is a LEGAL term, so don&#39;t use it. But since you&#39;re trying to be &#34;LEGAL&#34;, having been granted &#34;permission to learn&#34; (seriously am I the only one who finds that the most demeaning thing ever written on paper?), a car will do just nicely. But what if you get into an accident? It won&#39;t occur to you that accident is just that - an accident. There is no SURETY, real or implied, for something that&#39;s accidental. That&#39;s what makes it an accident! There is no intent behind the damage. But if you subjugate yourself to a PERSON, that PERSON will assume full SURETY for any damages, and like zombie-rape-baby-Jesus, this PERSON only exists on paper. All of you consider it so real, that people are jailed regularly for &#34;Driving without INSURANCE&#34;. It sort of &#34;drives&#34; the point home, doesn&#39;t it?

You have been pre-programmed to accept this subjugation, this ridiculous, FRAUDULENT, morally-bankrupt subjugation is a LEGAL necessity, and all of it deals with MONEY OF ACCOUNT. MONEY OF EXCHANGE never touches the equation. For those of you who are too lazy and/or stupid to learn the difference between MONEY OR ACCOUNT and MONEY OF EXCHANGE, one dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT is only capable of buying and/or cancelling another dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT. 90% of all money in the world is this type of money. It&#39;s pretend. It&#39;s not real. It only applies to the clubhouse rules, and it competes directly with the money in your pocket. This is the dynamic that everyone misses.

I hear lots of extremely accurate descriptions of how MONEY OR ACCOUNT is created, and they all come from idiots who know nothing about what money is. They&#39;ll go off on some tangent about Lou Manotti and his evil henchmen, the Freemasons.

Once again I&#39;d like to digress and remind everyone that on every occasion that I required a mason, free did not enter into the equation. Masons are fucking expensive, and there&#39;s no such thing as a free one.

...where was i?

As yes...MONEY OF ACCOUNT versus MONEY OF EXCHANGE.

THE TENDER FOR LAW is primarily about the money that carries that TENDER. There are lots of learned men who will talk endlessly about law. I have forgotten more about law than all of these men combined have ever learned. I say men because a woman&#39;s brain simply would not be able to encompass the blatant lies that the travesty that we call law spews at them. Reading the writings of Mary Elizabeth Croft will provide you with one example of what goes through a thinking-woman&#39;s mind when law is actually analyzed. You&#39;ll notice the things I teach you here from a law perspective, are really simple. They are all created with the intent of getting you out of accounting and surety. I have declared publicly on the record that the TENDER FOR LAW that money provides is, in fact, a FRAUD. Most of you reading this are probably already painfully aware of this fact.

My entire life plan relied on the RULE OF LAW remaining intact, but when the time came for me to assert my RIGHTS under that rule, the pretence became blatant. Anyone else going through what I have, would have been defeated; but as I constantly point out, I&#39;m descended from an evil, vile, pseudo-culture...and I&#39;ve forgotten more about law than any of these people will ever know. There are lawyers that will testify to that fact, so it&#39;s not like this should come as a surprise, but I have documented EVERYTHING. If it was spoken as regards me, I have a recording of it. If any name over which I have executive authority has been used in a document, I have a copy of it. Laid out on a time-line, the blatant FRAUD becomes irrefutable, conclusive proof of what everybody already knows.

I mention all this because what I&#39;m describing is, INSURANCE. Notice that my INSURANCE is a little different than the good neighbours at, &#34;State Farm&#34;. It&#39;s designed to put the SURETY where it belongs -- not with me. The difference between the good neighbours at State Farm and me, is that I am not subjugating myself. My INSURANCE is real. It exists in the real world, and the more astute among you will see that I am pushing it all into a universe of virtual worlds.

When you understand what money is, you can construct money through VALUE.

If it exists in the real world, it has VALUE. Any currency used to track that VALUE, when exchanging goods, is MONEY OF EXCHANGE.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not exist in the real world. Only its mysterious creators have any COPYHOLD on the VALUE. That&#39;s the thing about Bitcoin - in the end the guys that created it, get all the money. They get this because people volunteer to take alpha-test-grade, proof-of-concept code, and open their computers up to the Internet. They then give hardware-level access to their memory, processor, GPU and hard drive, to a rogue, autonomous process that their empty, little heads couldn&#39;t even dream of understanding, with no one paying attention to its original intent -- which is to prove that it could be done.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are people who are doing this on purpose, because the VALUE is returned almost immediately. For Bitcoin has all the properties of gold, without the liabilities. Bitcoin is but one cryptographic currency. AQUILAE has its own cryptographic currency. It cannot be counterfeited, and is a near-perfect accounting mechanism. AQUILAE is not even a PERSON, it&#39;s a TRUST. If a TRUST can have a currency, why can&#39;t you? What I am building for everyone here, is a method to remove the middle-man. If you have your own currency, you don&#39;t need a bank. If cryptographic currencies can&#39;t be counterfeited, then it&#39;s trade cannot be regulated. It remains within the private realm and the ease at which you can convert your currency to MONEY OF EXCHANGE anywhere in the world, is directly proportional to your VALUE. In the current economic framework, backed by debt-based FIAT currency, the only legitimate path to wealth is to produce, to make something in the real world that didn&#39;t exist before.

Like every dollar in existence, all things of VALUE have a creation date and a death date. Whatever you produce must be built with that in mind. For instance, producing a plaque with a cheesy-Jesus slogan on it, actually has VALUE. Perhaps it has VALUE to its creator, but here in reality, that plaque with the cheesy-Jesus slogan, will find its way to a landfill very quickly.

This very article you are reading has a creation date, and a death date, and this is becoming apparent with the four threads that just magically disappeared here. Pierre destroyed the thread where he was bestowed his sacred, native name. The thread itself had VALUE, for it reflected the culture from whence Pierre came. The colloquial term, &#34;fucking the dog&#34; refers to bored, unionized workers taking their one-hour breaks between their fifteen minutes of actual labour. Look at any road crew in Quebec and you will see a working example of &#34;fucking the dog.&#34; And so, Fucks the Puppy was bestowed upon Pierre as an homage, and in an irrational fit of nameless rage Pierre destroyed the thread, which by the way, is the most labour I&#39;ve ever seen out of labourer in Quebec. Ok, I don&#39;t really feel that way about people from Quebec. Don&#39;t quote me on it, but I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s an act or statute somewhere in Ontario that says I must make fun of people from Quebec. I&#39;m also pretty sure there&#39;s an equivalent act or statute for people in Quebec to refer to people in Ontario. Truth be told, one of the most inspirational people in my lifetime was Rene Levesque, and I strongly suggest that every single reader look at the history of this awesome shit-disturber.

Quebec politicians do some awesome things. For example, if you want to see awesome, political suicide, no one will ever beat Jacques Parizeau...but I digress again...

We were talking about INSURANCE.

My INSURANCE is my life plan. It&#39;s way off track, and I need to get it back on track. But my life plan relied on the Rule of Law remaining intact. And while we weren&#39;t looking, our RIGHTS got sold, and nobody bothered consulting us. My INSURANCE company went bust. The Rule of Law is not intact, and in my eyes they have forfeitted the right to exist; because I&#39;ve made it very clear, that limited liability is a fallacious concept, and if I stand by and watch the GOVERNMENT OF ONTARIO operating as &#34;JUSTICE&#34;, victimize the PUBLIC whose TRUST it holds, I become no better than you. I have a life plan that I must return to. I have a defective government process posing as &#34;JUSTICE&#34; and victimizing the citizens it has sworn to serve.

To return to my life plan under these circumstances is to make myself an enabler; and so I have a problem. For whether I like it or not, I&#39;m one of the good guys, and it&#39;s not a role I&#39;m comfortable with. There are many reasons for this, one of them being that to be the good guy, I have to do both. I have to get &#34;a&#34; Rule of Law in place, one that serves the interests of the people it governs. Since I love spewing out spoilers I&#39;m going to give the end of the story away RIGHT NOW! Why am I destroying your journey of discovery by giving away the ending? Because, FUCK YOU, that&#39;s why! I may be the good guy, but I don&#39;t have to be nice about it.

The only way to LEGALLY and LAWFULLY do what I propose is to restore EXECUTIVE POWER to the Monarchy for a period not exceeding five years. From this moment forward a primary focus of those who follow what I am teaching should be an investigation into why this is true. It is the only possible answer that has any chance of success. Over the next few weeks we will explore why giving executive power to a little old lady of Germanic descent, and nine Corgees, is a good idea. AND, because I&#39;m right, everybody is going to find out the hard way, that it is impossible to prove that I&#39;m wrong. That&#39;s what makes it right!

As I explain, step-by-step, how I intend to accomplish this lofty goal, it will become readily apparent that I already have everything in place. I&#39;ve planned for what&#39;s to come. AND, before shit gets real, I&#39;m going to train you all up to a level where you can think in a useful manner. By useful, I mean to YOU, because you currently think wrong, and VALUE the wrong things. It may be difficult to hear, but you&#39;re programmed to be a useless, sack-of-shit. If you should produce any VALUE, the government is there to lie to you about that VALUE, and to trick you into thinking you owE THEM for being VALUEable. If I&#39;m successful, all that stolen VALUE will be returned to the people it was stolen from. But what happens at the end of that five years? You see Elizabeth Windsor is the KEEPER OF THE TRUST. You see a little, old lady. I see an echo of a little girl that the world knew as Princess Elizabeth -- and her plea to the Commonweath to come to her aid. This is the SOVEREIGN OF THE COMMONWEALTH, and she didn&#39;t choose it. My grandfather taught me all I needed to know to TRUST Elizabeth Windsor. When the power is handed to her, she&#39;ll know what to do with it, because she knows that even if she fails at what is surely a lifetime of planning, she has you and I, as INSURANCE.

While this sinks in... Enjoy this LIVE FOOTAGE OF &#34;Scott Duncan Simu-Drones&#34; ATTACKING!

YOU ARE THE &#34;NATION&#34;

It is always a temptation to an armed and agile nation
To call upon a neighbour and to say: --
&#34;We invaded you last night--we are quite prepared to fight,
Unless you pay us cash to go away.&#34;

And that is called asking for Dane-geld,
And the people who ask it explain
That you&#39;ve only to pay &#39;em the Dane-geld
And then you&#39;ll get rid of the Dane!

It is always a temptation for a rich and lazy nation,
To puff and look important and to say: --
&#34;Though we know we should defeat you, we have not the time to meet you.
We will therefore pay you cash to go away.&#34;

And that is called paying the Dane-geld;
But we&#39;ve proved it again and again,
That if once you have paid him the Dane-geld
You never get rid of the Dane.

It is wrong to put temptation in the path of any nation,
For fear they should succumb and go astray;
So when you are requested to pay up or be molested,
You will find it better policy to say: --

&#34;We never pay any-one Dane-geld,
No matter how trifling the cost;
For the end of that game is oppression and shame,
And the nation that pays it is lost!&#34;

NEVER PAY THE DANE-GELD!

    Scott on the OPPT FRAUD- thread.....

ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD (OPPF)

You&#39;ll notice I didn&#39;t use the word TRUST.

Scams like this diminish the word in much the same way GOVERNMENTS have diminished the words �human rights�. As this is my forum, I think I will prevent the concept of TRUSTS being diminished any further by this scam.

So OPPF it is.

Before I get started about this, I&#39;m going to raise another TRUST system. It should have died at the outset because one guy ends up with the money. I&#39;m talking about bitcoin, except you can TRUST and VERIFY bitcoin. It is a mathematical process that requires no trust. You don&#39;t need to trust bitcoin any more than you need to trust 2 &#43; 2 = 4; and that&#39;s why bitcoin is a perfectly viable currency until the guy who started it gets all the money.

It is an automated-accounting, self-regulated currency. Bitcoin is the by-product of our knowledge of fundamental universal truths regarding numbers. For math is a pure discipline. There&#39;s nothing more to learn about it, and trillions of undiscovered things you can do with what we know.

I see a beauty and elegance, and even humour for those who can read the math in bitcoin. And that&#39;s why you can TRUST, because you get to VERIFY.

Now let&#39;s look at the ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD.

Those that can&#39;t be bothered clogging up valuable intellect with bullshit, can reduce OPPF to its base components...and it basically goes like this...

Three guys �reclaim� the world&#39;s wealth by way of the UCC, backed by the people in the TRUST. Except in every context with the UCC SERVICING NOTICE, etc., they are all LEGAL CLAIMS. The mere fact that you are GIVING NOTICE acknowledges the process. A TRUST cannot make aggressive moves like SERVING NOTICE and MAKING A CLAIM. A TRUST has AUTHORITY over what it RECEIVES. TRUSTS exist to fulfill a purpose based on ASSETS it has RECEIVED.

A TRUST IS NOT A PERSON UNDER LAW.

A TRUST IS NOT A PARTY UNDER LAW.

And a TRUST can only RECEIVE.

The AQUILAE TRUST, for example, has a PRIMARY MANDATE to restore EXECUTIVE POWER to The House of Windsor. This is a relatively unattainable goal. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll see Queen Elizabeth II saying, �Off with his head� in my lifetime, but that is, in fact, its PRIMARY MANDATE.

As it is a PRIVATE TRUST (PRIVATEER) we stand by to SERVE The House of Windsor. The House of Windsor can give AQUILAE an ORDER, and can TRUST that the ORDERS will be followed, even though The House of Windsor has no LEGAL or LAWFUL AUTHORITY over AQUILAE.

Every TRUSTEE is aware of this, and if &#39;Liz says, �Suit up and go to war�, we �Suit up and go to war�, because we said we would and she can TRUST us to do so.

PROMISARY NOTES have the CREDIT and WORTH of those making the promises. ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD are making promises they cannot LEGALLY AND/OR LAWFULLY keep.

It is therefore reasonable to presume, based on the preponderance of EVIDENCE, that the ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD exists SOLEY for the purpose of profiting from your credulity.

You have often heard me speak ill of Robert Menard, but I want you to pay close attention to what I speak. Robert Menard tells the absolute TRUTH about the law. In fact, I dare say you can almost (but not quite) TRUST what he says about law. If it&#39;s the TRUTH it doesn&#39;t matter who says it. 2 &#43; 2 = 4. It doesn&#39;t matter if I say it, or if Robert Menard says it, or if Charles Manson says it...2 &#43; 2 will still equal 4.

However, Robert Menard lies through omission. If you ever want to see Robert Menard fumble around, and ask bullshit-deflecting questions, just ask him what �THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER� means.

ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD is FRAUD at the outset. Always remember the noble lie. If it requires BELIEF in anything, spirits, gods, fairies, etc., you are being sold FRAUD. There are no exceptions to this rule.

From childhood you are sold the lie that faith and trust are equal, and they reinforce it with other lies like, �You must respect the beliefs of others.� Think about that for a second. Why must I respect the beliefs of others? Why have belief at all? If you examine the concept, belief is an end. It means you don&#39;t have to go looking any further. It means you can �just assume�, never having once examine WHY it should be believed.

Observe the threads in this very forum. My mere public position that �your ignorance does not equal my knowledge� immediately gets a million ad hominem attacks. I collect the names you call me like trophies, and all of you that call me these things remind me that none of you are capable of having original thought.

All because I have offended your �beliefs�.

And you enter with the arrogant position that if I don&#39;t believe what you do, there must be something wrong with me, which reveals your hypocrisy. You see, in order for you to have the opportunity to say these things about me, you most certainly would have had to initiate the communication; because the only reason you would talk to me is because you want my knowledge.

I would not talk to you. Your very beliefs negate the possibility of UNDERSTANDING. You have nothing of VALUE for me, and presenting an �alternate view� which focuses on bullshit always seems to neglect to mention the fact that it is, in fact, focused on bullshit.

In short, belief has no VALUE. Those who say it does are selling you FRAUD, and you must always suspect the motives of those selling demonstrable FRAUD as TRUST.

The most primitive example of the self-imposed ignorance of belief can be found in Roman Numerals; and before I start with this I just want to remind everyone that the Ancient Greeks calculated the circumference of the earth, so the concept of zero was well-known throughout history. If you BELIEVE otherwise, examine the source of that belief and you will discover it is, in fact, bullshit.

The number zero represents fifty percent of all math in existence. If you do not understand that statement, and do not understand why that is, you are not qualified to speak of math. I digress...

I think of my own personal knowledge of computer science, and the vast technological powers I wield simply because �nobody else knows how to do it.� I cringe in empathetic fear for humanity when I look upon its nine billion souls, all in some way, intimately tied to science and technology, and knowing nothing about science and technology. Even the most simple-minded amongst you cannot be so stupid that they cannot see this situation is a recipe for disaster.

And every day, I&#39;ll hear some ignorant, credulous adult, with an imaginary friend, declare that I am ignorant, and that I am �closed-minded�, of course; and this is my personal favorite, that I&#39;m �mentally ill� or some sub-category therein.

These people truly believe that their ignorance is wisdom, and that their belief equals my knowledge; and that is precisely why I DO NOT RESPECT THE BELIEFS OF OTHERS.

Let&#39;s jump back in time to the Romans. The Romans had a technologically-evolving society. Mathematics and computer science were actually in heavy use, and numeric policy and process allowed those that could conceptualize the math to engineer aqueducts that are working to this day.

Computer Science is profoundly powerful knowledge. I have the ability to literally speak to the universe, and it will speak back � in numbers. The test for intelligence is the test of understanding prime numbers, for these things are universal, and all of it requires not one scrap of belief.

Those who don&#39;t see that only prove my point, because it&#39;s as true as 2 &#43; 2 = 4...

...and I&#39;ll demonstrate with the Romans.

Bookkeeping&#39;s a boring job, isn&#39;t it? Those who have been saddled with such a task will know what I&#39;m describing when I speak of numbers dancing in your head, and you, being a pattern-seeking mammal, indulge yourself in the boredom by seeing how you make these numbers dance in a pattern you have not yet seen.

This is actually a very profound process and a lot of people miss it. The last thing the Romans wanted were smart bookkeepers. Bookkeepers make the rules. None of you see that. Watch �The Agenda� with Steve Paikin. VALE and the Chartered Accountants of Ontario sponsor the show, and they&#39;ll proudly tell you how long they&#39;ve been setting PUBLIC POLICY.

None of you are aware of this, because none of you think; and Steve Paikin&#39;s shows are for people who can think, so there&#39;s zero risk of discovery.

You can see for yourself, your masters laughing at your idiocy.

All the belief in the world is not going to change that reality....

...back to the Romans.

A society that&#39;s growing as a result of computer science needs to hide the computer science part. I know more than you do by default. I&#39;ve simply dedicated more time to any subject you raise than you have to studying it. It doesn&#39;t matter what you believe...this is simply true.

I don&#39;t possess any mental powers you don&#39;t; and I don&#39;t possess any mental powers that the bookkeeper with �dancing-numbers-in-his-head� has.

You can see where this is going.

Discovery of computer science is inevitable, and accountants will find it first. I&#39;m not going to find any gold in the Klondike if I don&#39;t go to the Klondike. You&#39;re not going to find computer science if you don&#39;t go to where math is used constantly.

So, the problem is reduced to one simple goal. How do you stop a smart, little bookkeeper from discovering computer science, without affecting the quality of his work? Enter the Roman Numeral system.

Literacy was restricted to the upper casts; and the ignorant will leap and cling to what they can understand. In less than one generation the Roman Numeral system was injected into society with the DECLARATION, �This is math!�

...and there you have it. The next generation will truly believe that Roman Numerals are actual numbers. They show the math function, and thus no one has reason to believe that the declaration, �This is math� was a lie, or that anyone&#39;s agenda was being served by believing that lie.

Such beliefs cause the believers of Roman Numerals to say that those �crazy people� who have no faith in the Roman Numeral system and their kooky religious terms like fast Fourier transform (FFT), Fibonacci Sequences, and calculus are just products of their ignorance...

...is this sounding familiar?

Do you get the idea?

And so we return to ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD.

In the comments below I&#39;ll go step-by-step through the very base principles your beliefs have made you blind to. Unlike any other time in history, we all have the wealth of human knowledge at our fingertips. The ONLY weapon that those who work against your interests possess, is your ignorance. Belief is what gives ignorance VALUE to them.

Ignorance serves those working against your interests.

The people who sell you these FRAUDS are so effective because they truly believe in them, and of course that belief serves another unseen agenda...

...because the people that mean you harm, don&#39;t actually know you. It&#39;s not personal. You&#39;re a cow to be herded, because THEY took the time to learn things YOU didn&#39;t.

And to the adults with imaginary friends, I dare say you attribute every �good� quality in you to that imaginary friend; and all the bad qualities in you, you attribute to yourself, because you&#39;re �a horrible wretched sinner� that needs �forgiving� for some unknown crime called �sin�.

There really are people that laugh at the fact that immorality is sold as morality. It gives them comfort that in 2013, declaring that you&#39;re an adult with an imaginary friend is not only �normal�, but is in fact a prerequisite for becoming President of the United States.

I&#39;m told that Governor of Alaska is another possibility too.

I&#39;m still trying to figure out why stating the truth is �ego�. It is always the first motivator that I&#39;m accused of. I suspect it&#39;s loosely connected to the other strange belief that people&#39;s hurt feelings make my position wrong; and if they&#39;re Christian they seem to think some sort of harm should come to me as a result. They counter this vile thought with some empty expression of �love�, because Love hasn&#39;t been diminished by belief enough!

You have to see things from my perspective as well. When you declare that you&#39;re �offended�, there&#39;s an automatic process that I programmed, with intent in my head, and it routes all data from that point on, to the same place in my head that I route whining. For, in the end, when you say that you&#39;re offended, you should just presume that my response is, �So what?� You&#39;re whining does not change what I said.

All that being said, I request you, friends, comrades, brothers, sisters, to try to keep the banter to a minimum; and I know I&#39;m as guilty as you are for this...

I&#39;ve had a good stern talk with myself on the subject regarding this thread.

I am going to go through this whole document of THE ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD. We&#39;re going to play �Biology Class� with this piece of LEGAL BULLSHIT.

I am going to put this fake �living document� (powered by �Belief�) on the stainless steel table, and while it cries out for mercy, I shall carve out its entrails, piece-by-piece. And we shall examine these entrails while it writhes in pain.

And then we&#39;ll toss away those pieces because they don&#39;t survive the light of understanding. At the end of our little legal biology class, with two goals accomplished, you will see the ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD for what it is, and I will have given it the slow and painful execution it so richly deserves.

    Scott on How-To-Understand-basically-what &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34; means in the Criminal Code and How-Tricky-Legalese-Is thread.....

THE TENDER FOR LAW � LEGALESE FOR IDIOTS (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

It&#39;s feast or famine around here at THE TENDER FOR LAW. This is article number two in as many days!

Derek Moran says that he finds it difficult to believe that I will be able to top the SURETY article...CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.

It is almost midnight on Sunday, I&#39;m on the bridge of the Tycho-Brahe, and as I look out onto the lake the water is like a sheet of glass...and it&#39;s not even frozen. How can I not produce a superior article tonight? So today, with all my &#34;God&#34; complex, &#34;arrogance&#34;, and the knowledge that a host of &#34;pseudo radio&#34; is reading my superior work, and knowing that all he can do is tremble in impotent fury. Things are so good I can cover the bad aspects of law, namely its language.

Some of you may have already started to figure this out, but every single word in a legal document is designed specifically for the purpose of trapping you. Even words like AND, OR, IS, MAY, SHOULD...all of these are traps! And law dictionaries use them perfectly. You may have noticed words like UNDERSTAND don&#39;t mean what you think they mean. This is the lowest of the low-hanging fruit in the legal world. What I am about to teach you here is the legalese equivalent of &#34;code breaking&#34;.

Let&#39;s jump back to the 1500&#39;s...

This is the time in our civilization that we often refer to as the Renaissance. The reason the Renaissance occurred is that whole shitloads of people were dying of various forms of plague, and rat-shit-covered scientists were baffled as to why this virulent disease was spreading everywhere.

The practical result of all this was that a whole shitload of people died, and the ones that made it, inherited all their possessions. Efforts to communicate more efficiently became a social priority, because there was lots to do to maintain all this new property, and not enough people to do it. For nearly 800 years &#34;God&#34; was everything, despite his demonstrable lack of assistance in this era. You see the age where &#34;God&#34; was everything was called the &#34;dark ages&#34;. Every time I hear an adult with an &#34;imaginary friend&#34; talk about how &#34;ignorant and closed-minded&#34; I am, all I see is an individual that wishes to return to that horrible time.

As there were fewer people in the 1500&#39;s, and the Renaissance was just getting underway, inherited art was often used as currency. The next generation had a higher literacy rate than the previous, and so administrative rules were born. It doesn&#39;t take a &#34;Rocket Scientist&#34; to see how useful slipping Shakespeare in around the latter half of the 1500&#39;s would be to those few who don&#39;t actually do any work. The false profession of &#34;law&#34; was born.

You&#39;ll notice that nobody ever &#34;does&#34; law. They only &#34;practice&#34; it. They keep practising and practising, but they never quite get it right (that&#39;s what you get for not subscribing to the TENDER FOR LAW!).

From the 1500&#39;s to the present, there has been an odd phenomenon regarding language. English is a Germanic language that merged with the language of the Angols (we will discuss the Angols and the Picts in another article). Germanic influence on the language of the Angols resulted in the English written in the MAGNA CARTA. But if you try to learn German today, you&#39;ll notice an interesting phenomenon. Though the words you use sound startlingly similar, and the really observant can actually pick out the words when German speak and get a general idea of what they&#39;re saying, even if they don&#39;t speak the language. Except further study shows that the Germans speak &#34;backwards&#34; grammatically. Jumping to the south-west, Spanish, a much simpler language, where every vowel is a syllable, and words say what they mean, but once again, &#34;grammatically backwards&#34;. Head north-east in our mental European map...to France...well France is filled with French people so we needn&#39;t bother with them. Those French have a different word for everything, and their language is, you guessed it, &#34;grammatically backwards&#34;.

Those of you noticing the pattern here will not be using too much intellect when they start posing the question, &#34;Maybe we&#39;re the ones that are backwards&#34;. And that is almost, but not quite true.

Like a virus, legalese infected the English language. It&#39;s encouraged to this day to use legalese to appear &#34;smart&#34;. This is done on purpose. It is an insidious piece of social engineering.

The want you to try to use these words without knowing what the little words mean.

IT&#39;S ALL ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS.

When you read, you read from left to right on a page. The small words actually exclude part of the sentence. You will notice in my now famous, NOTICE OF MISTAKE, that I always use &#34;and/or&#34;. I do this on purpose, because I like to keep my options open.

Maxims of Law say it plainly. The inclusion of one thing excludes all others. The definition of a PERSON in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA is the most hysterical example of this. The definition of PERSON is hidden in the larger scope of &#34;every one&#34;. The common law maxim, &#34;The INCLUSION of one is the exclusion of another&#34; means in the context of the CRIMINAL CODE INCLUDES &#34;Her Majesty&#34; AND an &#34;organization&#34;. See for yourself:

*** THE CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA***
�every one�, �person� and �owner�

� quiconque �, � individu �, � personne � et � propri�taire �

�every one�, �person� and �owner�, and similar expressions, include Her Majesty and an organization;

**********************************

You will find this by searching for R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 under the Interpretations Section.

In reality, what this says is that a &#34;PERSON&#34; is &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;. Unless you are &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34; people answering to these acts and statutes are simply &#34;performing these acts&#34; (remember Shakespeare) on &#34;HER MAJESTY&#39;s&#34; behalf, much like the GOVERNOR GENERAL PERFORMS royal duties on the Queen&#39;s behalf. This is why the GOVERNOR GENERAL is always a chosen CITIZEN, and not an elected official.

The GOVERNOR GENERAL ACTS as the Queen when the Queen is not in town. This of course has nothing to do with &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;.

When dealing with the LAW, in CANADA anyway, you are always dealing with &#34;HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA&#34;, which as we all know is a CORPORATE ORGANIZATION.

&#34;OR&#34; means you have a choice, &#34;one&#34; OR the &#34;other&#34;, but not BOTH.

So, in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA, a PERSON can be &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;. A PERSON can be &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;, but a PERSON must also be an &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;. Notice it does not say &#34;OR&#34; an organization in the above interpretation. Confused yet?

That happens in Legalese. Let&#39;s, instead of looking at this dry, depressing CRIMINAL CODE stuff, look at something happy, exciting and real.

I can say with absolute certainty that no woman on the planet has loved me more than Tara. However, no amount of love would compel her to JOINDER herself to a &#34;BILL OF LADING&#34;, and hand it over to the GOVERNMENT. That means &#34;getting married&#34; (for the stupid amongst you). I&#39;m sorry if that sounds condescending (that means talking down to people).

Now think about this marriage transaction. The marriage INCLUDES &#34;Scott&#34; AND &#34;Tara&#34;, not &#34;Scott&#34; OR &#34;Tara&#34;. This means marriage makes you effectively ONE PERSON UNDER THE LAW. Since the marriage actually consists of THREE ENTITIES, &#34;Scott&#34; AND &#34;Tara&#34;, which by its nature EXCLUDES the GOVERNMENT, still remains an &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;. A marriage ORGANIZES these &#34;entities&#34; into their respective roles. If &#34;Scott&#34; AND &#34;Tara&#34; remain &#34;Scott AND Tara&#34;, the GOVERNMENT HAS NO STANDING. However, if Tara sought a divorce, the MARRIED PERSON is no longer &#34;Scott AND Tara&#34;, and the GOVERNMENT gets to intervene.

This most certainly wouldn&#39;t be the case if it was &#34;Scott&#34; OR &#34;Tara&#34;. Therefore, the above CRIMINAL CODE definition of &#34;PERSON&#34; defines HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ***INSERT PROVINCE HERE***, which is both &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34; AND an &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;.

Every one who is CHARGED in CANADA is usually CHARGED by their PROVINCE. For instance, if I were to take the ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD lawyer &#34;Heather&#34; and bash her skull into jelly with a ball-peen hammer (as she so richly deserves), I would likely be CHARGED with HOMICIDE in the JURISDICTION where I chose to do this &#34;skull-bashing&#34;. As I&#39;m a profoundly lazy man I probably wouldn&#39;t travel, so ONTARIO would be the JURISDICTION. This makes &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34; AND the &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;, &#34;HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO&#34;. Since all ACTS and STATUTES fall to PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;, this makes all PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34; effectively &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34;. HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO is in fact, an &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;. You now have the qualifications for a &#34;PERSON&#34; as defined in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA.

Just as the &#34;marriage&#34; consists of &#34;Scott AND Tara&#34;, which effectively creates an &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;, &#34;HER MAJESTY&#34; and the organization defined as &#34;IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO&#34; create a &#34;PERSON&#34; which YOU are presumed to be a PUBLIC SERVANT of. This effectively means all CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS are simply administrative processes for that &#34;ORGANIZATION&#34;. The NOTICE OF MISTAKE effectively removes that presumption.

You now see how powerful the words &#34;and&#34; and &#34;or&#34; are. If AQUILAE says the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is &#34;Scott AND Tara&#34;, this would mean neither of us individually could act as CAPTAIN, but &#34;Scott and Tara&#34; could BOTH be CAPTAIN. This means that all ORDERS from the CAPTAIN must come from BOTH Scott AND Tara. However, the AQUILAE TRUST is not a stupid document, and the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott OR Tara. This means that when Tara speaks, everyone shuts the fuck up...including me. It&#39;s Scott OR Tara - not BOTH!

&#34;AND&#34; refers to BOTH. &#34;OR&#34; does not. This is why putting &#34;and/or&#34; gives you the options; and since the AQUILAE TRUST is pretty much perfect, here in reality, the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott and/or Tara.

This means I can ACT as CAPTAIN, Tara can ACT as CAPTAIN, and we can BOTH ACT as CAPTAIN. Recipients of this POLICY have NO STANDING to contest when we assume and/or drop the role of CAPTAIN. Why do we do this, you ask? Because FUCK OFF, THAT&#39;S WHY! If you&#39;re even looking at the AQUILAE TRUST, you&#39;re a fucking TRUSTEE; and the only reason you should be looking at the AQUILAE TRUST is to find the best way to &#34;Shut the fuck up and do what you&#39;re told&#34; for Scott and/or Tara....

And that is how you make a powerful LEGAL document with the words &#34;and/or&#34;, and the reason why we write things this way. Use AND &amp; OR to restrict other parties. Use BOTH (and/or) to free yourself.

If your document is stating the terms, make it as open as possible for YOU, and as restrictive as possible for every OTHER PARTY. If somebody is thought of as a &#34;good lawyer&#34;, it means they have mastered this skill. Were I to be practising law, I would be a very, very good lawyer.

One of our loyal readers made the horrendous mistake of using different words, in another post. Instead of NOTICE OF MISTAKE he said, NOTICE OF &#34;ERROR&#34;, which means something completely different. If you look up the legal definition of &#34;mistake&#34; you will notice amongst other things (inter alia) the legal definition of &#34;MISTAKE&#34; ends with &#34;, or error&#34;. If you are going to learn from the TENDER FOR LAW, you must always remember the Number 1 Rule of the Universe:

SCOTT IS ALWAYS RIGHT!

You can save yourself a lot of time by NOT second-guessing Scott, and proceeding to figure out WHY Scott is right.

This also means that when I present a document you should presume it&#39;s perfect, and that changing it will fuck you over in ways you don&#39;t even understand. &#34;NOTICE OF ERROR&#34; is not &#34;NOTICE OF MISTAKE&#34;. You don&#39;t change the document because you think it &#34;sounds cooler&#34;. You don&#39;t change the document because you think another cooler-sounding word means the same thing; and I will always interpret such changes as TENDERING AN OFFER to amuse me, by allowing me to berate you for your stupidity, and to laugh at you when a court kicks your ass. This is a TENDER I will gladly ACCEPT and volunteer for, with the added bonus that I will execute my duties in this TENDER to the best of my abilities. I&#39;m really good at that too.

Taking what you have just learned here and reading through ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD, will reveal some very interesting and insidious things. You&#39;re better off serving me as a slave, because unlike ONE PEOPLE&#39;S PUBLIC FRAUD, I won&#39;t lie to you, and I&#39;ll tell you exactly what I mean.

So there you have it, AND &amp; OR - two hidden keys to legalese and the knowledge that &#34;include also excludes&#34;...and before you ask EXCLUDES includes all that remains. Use EXCLUDE to get rid of everything else; use INCLUDE to restrict to a single point/item.

The guy with the fake &#34;charity&#34; seeking legal advice actually asked what TENDER means, and it occurs to me that those who AREN&#39;T lying to me might wonder too. TENDER in the context of Law means, &#34;to present to PERSON, an unconditional offer, to enter into a contract&#34;. Look at those words, then look at a bank note. THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER means, &#34;THIS NOTE IS AN UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW&#34;. That is why the group name is so clever. This group is ABOUT that UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW. It&#39;s ALL money.

Money is JOINDER. JOINDER MAY (Read as: &#34;ALWAYS DOES&#34;) INCLUDE SURETY!

THIS is the LEGALESE you need to know. NO MORE. Your ONLY goal should be to REMOVE and/or AVOID SURETY when dealing in commerce and/or LAW. WHEN YOU SIGN A CHEQUE, you are TENDERING SURETY. A BANK NOTE does NOT THENDER SURETY as the SURETY is signed for, by SOMEBODY ELSE.

If you have OTHER LEGALESE questions, post them in the comments. OFF TOPIC COMMENTS WILL BE DELETED. LEGALESE IS A COMPLEX SUBJECT, SO BE PREPARED FOR VANISHING POSTS, and/or BANNING if you do post something OFF TOPIC.

    THE TENDER FOR LAW PRESENTS: ALL THE SHIT THAT DEAN KORY IS DOING WRONG!

...AND NAZIS!

Ok, that&#39;s a bit of an overly dramatic title, in as much as the courts don&#39;t actually follow their own rules any more.

Still though... You still get Nazis, so there&#39;s that.

Just because they don&#39;t feel like following the rules, doesn&#39;t mean we have to be �scumbags� like them. I listened to all the audio recordings that Dean Kory made of his hearings (time I&#39;ll never get back, so you fucking owe me, dude!), and I feel it&#39;s important for me to correct a few key points here.

I know all of you get your information from multiple sources, ranging from the Grand-Poobah of the Free-Dumb Movement, Robert Menard, to Dean Clifford, to Winston Strout; and maybe it&#39;s just self-aggrandizement, but I like to think I&#39;m the only source that tells you the truth instead of just orbiting it. As with many things in life there&#39;s �more than one way to skin a cat�. However, one of the worst things you can do is �mix methods�.

Dean Clifford and I are at exact opposite ends of the scale. Dean&#39;s name is Trust property, thus giving the man that you know as Dean Clifford a great number of options the rest of you don&#39;t have. He doesn&#39;t use the Trust like a bank machine, he doesn&#39;t abuse any of the authority that any Trust title gives him, and he has the personal knowledge that he&#39;s not on his own if he has to �get the fuck out of Dodge�. That&#39;s where the consensus ends amoung us.

Dean&#39;s teachings on Trust Law are accurate, concise and accessible. For some reason it&#39;s worth it for him to give everything he teaches those qualities.

I&#39;m not like that.

I&#39;m not a super-genius, and I don&#39;t possess any mental powers that you don&#39;t. Any discussion and/or engagement with me starts off with the reality that you ALL THINK WRONG, and YOU ALL VALUE THE WRONG THINGS! This does not serve you when you are up against reality.

The sad part is that most of you are too old to change; and as I&#39;ve demonstrated here in this little forum, none of you can tell the difference between what&#39;s true and what feels good. I know what you&#39;re experiencing. Whether from Dean, or from myself, the time always comes when you read something that one of us writes and you KNOW that it is true; but you take no further time to understand what is being told to you.

Fortunately Dean Kory has provided us a working/living example of what happens when all of the above factors are in play.

The first obvious mistake that Dean Kory is making is that he is combining what Dean Clifford teaches with what I teach. For the purposes of this article I&#39;m going to dumb the two positions down so you can make the comparison.

Dean Clifford is all about being left alone, and when he&#39;s not left alone, he is about calling �them� to account.

I&#39;m not like that.

I am descended from the very people that put all of this in place. Entire stereotypes about Scottish people exist to misdirect. Most will tell you that Scotsmen are �cheap�, when in reality we are conservative about when we engage in commerce. You have but to look at England&#39;s and Scotland&#39;s history to see why this is true.

The very name of this group, THE TENDER FOR LAW, is all about that mysterious phrase, �THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER�.

I&#39;ll be the first to admit there are a great number of benefits to be enjoyed in commerce, when everybody plays by the rules. As I&#39;m sure everyone is sadly aware of, by now; Nobody is playing by the rules anymore.

Trying to �fix the system�, or call them to account in their own system, is simply �appealing to your rapist�. It baffles me that anyone would think this is sound thinking.

...I digress.

As I&#39;m in a unique position to �follow the money�, I can determine who needs to pay the price for the royal screw-over we&#39;ve been given. As I type this, a team of system&#39;s engineers (and trained monkeys) are preparing for you, the reader, a step-by-step guide for cleaning out every financial institution that touches these shores. The only price that I ask for this knowledge is that you pass it on to others. Pay it forward...and get paid at the same time. Who else offers that shit?

I am many things. I am prorogued Nobility. I am a published author. I am a composer. Above all...the thing that forms the core of who and what I am, is that I am a computer scientist. Those who have taken the time to actually listen to me, will recognize many �Scott-isms�; and the phrase �COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING� is repeated almost as often as my Number 1 �Scott-ism�, �THE MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG.� You ignore these two truths at your own peril.

...and reality does not care what you �believe�.

This lengthy preamble is to drive the next point home.

DO NOT TRY TO COMBINE DEAN&#39;S METHODS WITH MINE.

There is no remedy in fraud. There simply isn&#39;t.

In many ways I long for the old days where those who breached the PUBLIC TRUST were hauled into the street and thrown into an angry mob. Authors have mistakenly used the term, �Hanging Judge� as a term for a judge imposing strict penalties; but if you look through actual history, and not the crap you were taught in the Public Fool System, �Hanging Judge� refers to a judge who has abused his power and has been hung for the abuse of that trust. He gives sentences he should be hung for; HANGING JUDGE. You never hear the phrase �hanging JUSTICE� This is odd, as there are so many of them. ...I know. Digressing. I get it.

We don&#39;t have Judges any more, in Canada. A judge traditionally was a trusted individual who could uphold the PUBLIC TRUST. �We the people� no longer get to decide who is worthy of that trust. People confuse the role of �judge� with the current role of �JUSTICE�. It is important to know the distinction.

JUSTICE is actually a �doing-business-as� name for a Crown Corporation. It actually says, in the Dunn and Bradstreet listings �Government of Ontario Operating as JUSTICE�. It has been like that, IN VARIOUS FORMS, since 1982.
.
..I&#39;m sorry you missed it.

That is what you&#39;re dealing with, and you have ONE unalienable RIGHT; THE RIGHT NOT TO CONTRACT.

My position is a lot closer to that held by Irene Gravenhorst, than it is to Dean Clifford&#39;s.

So, let&#39;s cover what Dean Kory is doing wrong!

I notice a lot of �Clifford-isms� in what Dean Kory is clearly attempting to say; but all of Dean Clifford&#39;s methods depend on what I like to refer to as �Clubhouse Rules�, and every time you do this you&#39;re pretending to �be in the club�. The natural response to somebody doing this is very similar to the response to somebody saying they know more than I. In case you haven&#39;t noticed I smack them down in the most humiliatingly, and public way possible. �Their� reaction is going to be much the same...we&#39;re all human after all.

NOTICE OF MISTAKE (like the cheese) stands alone.

It is the only issue you should be concerned about! NOTHING ELSE!

SERIOUSLY! Accepting discussion about anything else, is a FUCKING NEGOTIATION. All of you are not seeing the forest through the trees. This is why I say Dean Clifford&#39;s position is flawed. He believes the tree can be pruned to look pretty again, when in reality it needs it&#39;s roots burned out, and it&#39;s limbs chopped up for one of Sir-Mica&#39;s gassifiers! The fucking tree is dead!

UNDERSTAND?

The tree is dead!

It&#39;s filled with parasites and rot, and the parasites are trying to keep the illusion of a tree standing. For the past two years I have been feeding them the rope, at my own expense, and with violence inflicted upon me, so that any argument contrary to my position is immediately nullified. IT IS/WILL BE, CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE that you are NOT getting what you are entitled to, given the burden of surety you have carried!

Unlike THE MAJORITY of your �sources of truth�:

I&#39;m not one of these people that wants to drive without a licence.
I&#39;m not one of these people that don&#39;t want to pay their mortgage.
I&#39;m not one of these people that don&#39;t want to pay their taxes.
I DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE I FUCKING PROMISED TO!
I am, however, someone that possesses knowledge and skills that the government finds/found essential to their expansion. In my youth I gave our erstwhile government a tool, which all of you pay the price for today; and I was rewarded handsomely. I patted myself on the back, and strutted around, knowing that I was smarter than everyone else, and never once paying attention to the harm I had caused.

In compliance with an oath I took a long time ago, I must atone for that; and that&#39;s the only reason you, the reader, even know that I exist.

I need to remind you again, that the only reason I&#39;m here, is that I promised to be.

None of you have value to me. You&#39;re not qualified to.

I have a lot to teach you, and we are barely getting started; but I am not responsible for the shit that goes wrong when you try to take what I teach you (�REALITY�) and you try to jam it into your idiotic, unqualified, belief structure. As I write that sentence I wonder how many of you have actually pondered that other �Scott-ism� you frequently hear; �ALL BELIEF IS EVIL.� If you believe something, you will stop questioning it; you will stop investigating it, and you will never ponder if, and why, it&#39;s true.

Should you believe something, that just happens to be true, you won&#39;t look any further � and that&#39;s a problem.

So I want everyone to keep the following in mind. All the sources you are investigating tell the truth about the law, but there are pitfalls!

Everything Robert Menard says about the law is true. It&#39;s what he doesn&#39;t say that&#39;s the lie. If you want quick confirmation of this simply ask him what, �This note is legal tender� means. If he tells you the truth (he won&#39;t), ask him why he&#39;s constantly �begging� for that very same TENDER FOR LAW that contains the ACTS and STATUTES that he claims don&#39;t apply to him! THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER is a TENDER FOR LAW. If you BENEFIT, then you have OBLIGATION!

Everything Dean Clifford says about the law is true, but how he chooses to apply it, is not; because there&#39;s still a lot of �belief� running around in his head. He still believes he can �beat them at their own game.� He will proudly point out their public and blatant violations... His evidence is irrefutable and conclusive. His rights are violated by those TRUSTEES of the PUBLIC, and then he tries to seek remedy from those same trustees! REALLY?

...and then says the remedy, is to go to those very same people and �sue� them..in the very same courts that violated his rights. (What?) ...Oh that&#39;s right, those are DIFFERENT courts, with DIFFERENT
�Doing business as� JUSTICES. (WHAT?) ...well, I&#39;ll just let you work out the flaw from there. If you can&#39;t, then you are too stupid to be reading this, and you should kill yourself.

Feel free to try it this way. It&#39;s NOT �wrong�, but it ignores the fact that those who hold the PUBLIC TRUST, ARE wrong. Another �Scott-ism� is my position that NONE OF YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT&#39;S TRUE AND WHAT FEELS GOOD! Following Dean Clifford&#39;s methods WILL drive this point home, so it&#39;s not a COMPLETE waste.

Well then...back to Dean Kory.

Rumour has it, through the grape vine, that the erstwhile Mr. Kory has been and/or will be, a guest on Global C.R.A.P. Radio, hosted by the redoubtable Tony �guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth� Butros. This promises to be an exciting show, and I cannot wait to miss it. I eagerly anticipate the thrill of not consuming time I&#39;ll never get back.

Instead I&#39;ll put something useful here � advice for your next court room appearance, Mr. Kory.

When you&#39;re in the court room dealing with these babbling, sacks-of-shit, learn to use the breaks. Repeat after me, �I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS�. If they ignore your question, then your next response should be, �OBJECTION. If the court cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.� Keep repeating that, and repeating that, and repeating that...until they answer your fucking question.

I listen to you in court, Dean Kory, and I picture a girl screaming rape while slipping the condom on the rapist. I notice the distinct lack of that phrase in ANY of your recordings, so repeat it in your head, �Objection. If you cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.�

Apply THE TENDER FOR LAW Rule to this. I choose my words very, very carefully, because I know what they mean. You, the reader, seem to believe there&#39;s a library in your ass, because that&#39;s demonstrably where you keep pulling your answer out of. If you see me using a phrase that should be used in court, the very first thing you should do is follow my rules. Look up every single word, even, no scratch that, ESPECIALLY, if you THINK you know what the word means. As the regular reader for THE TENDER FOR LAW will tell you, you most certainly don&#39;t.

Dean Kory reserves his rights, and then doesn&#39;t know what the fuck to do with them; but that&#39;s ok, because there are plenty of other people in the court room that know what to do with Dean Kory&#39;s rights.

One thing Dean Kory should learn is that he is most certainly not Dean Clifford. Make no mistake, it doesn&#39;t matter if I disagree with Dean Clifford&#39;s methods. The fact is, I understand them. What Dean Clifford is doing is beyond your current level of comprehension. He is not joking when he says that everything he says and does, is part of a larger plan. I disagree with Dean Clifford&#39;s position and methods, because he pays too high a price for the sake of worthless people; but he&#39;s doing it for all of you, and not just for himself. I will admit statistically, this does skew the numbers in his favour; because in the end, Dean Clifford is like you. You all think wrong, and value the wrong things.

The only difference between you and Dean Clifford is that some of the things he values ARE the right things.

We are all doing this for different reasons.

Robert Menard will try to scam you out of every cent you have by telling you the truth...because he thinks you deserve it. You&#39;re the Mafia wife, the enabler, and he rationalizes that he&#39;s not taking anything of any value from you.

Dean Clifford sees that you&#39;re all asleep, and he values mankind as a whole; but like Mary Croft before him, he&#39;s beginning to realize that everyone prefers �lucid dreaming� to actually being awake. The time he takes pandering to that crowd robs him of time, and returns nothing.

My position is blatantly self-centered. I was born with a title I didn&#39;t choose. I was sold to the government, and warehoused for McMaster University because it turned out I was smarter than everybody...and apparently that&#39;s a crime. When I began to call all parties to account, they spared themselves by making certain promises and offering certain concessions and entitlements, which they no longer honour.

My aim is to misbehave.

Like Robert Menard, I want you to suffer for your ignorance, especially if you&#39;ve come to me before. I want to wield what I know against those who would dare seek to harm me and those that I care about; because all of you are walking a path now, and none of you realize it&#39;s a one-way trip. You all want your freedom, and my position is, �Be careful what you wish for.�

As you all think wrong, and value the wrong things, so it is unlikely you could possibly know what to do with freedom. If you find yourself making that one-way trip, through that hole in the fence, remember that on the other side, are people just like me.

All of you are welcomed to believe whatever makes you feel good. Martin Sutton&#39;s belief, for instance, makes him feel good, and he identifies it as the core of who he is; and all I can think is, �This is what happens when evil has consumed an extraordinary man.�

ALL belief is evil. Martin Sutton is incapable of evil, so the belief sits there like a parasite, taking this man&#39;s good qualities and giving them to �Jesus�.

At this point I can classify Martin Sutton as belief&#39;s �best-case-scenario�.

Belief is taking not thinking and making a virtue out of it.

All of the people from whom you seek knowledge are extraordinary in their own way. However, reality doesn&#39;t care about these things.

I certainly hope this effort gets Mr. Kory focused on what&#39;s important, but the reality is, all of this is a symptom of a much larger problem.

We&#39;re all running out of time. I don&#39;t know if anyone has noticed the professional name-callers have been labeling people who point out the truth as �conspiracy theorists�, while at the same time publishing the inane babbling of actual conspiracy theorists. This method is much like Americans putting people who hire hookers on sex-offender registries, thus removing any distinction between a guy who indulges in a rent-a-fuck-toy experience, and the Scarborough rapist. Because none of you understand the exponential function, you couldn&#39;t see the bell-curve of your rights being whittled away.

Before I end this article, let&#39;s take a little walk through Canadian legal history.

At this point in legal history, the Criminal Code pretends to be the Common Law remedy, bestowed to an administrative zone of a sole proprietor CORPORATION called Canada...but this wasn&#39;t always the case.

I&#39;m going to presume that you don&#39;t have knowledge of the Canadian Bill of Rights. I freely admit this is not a reasonable presumption as Dean Clifford never shuts up about it (I swear that guy jerks off reading it).

One of the most protected rights in that bill of rights was Freedom of Speech. Under the Bill of Rights �offences� like hate speech, blasphemous libel (yes, that&#39;s a criminal code offence � look it up), and �uttering a death threat�, would not be possible.

The UK Canada Act 1982, better known as �The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms�, includes a �notwithstanding� clause. This gives the elected representatives of an administrative zone&#39;s constituency the power and authority to say, �Fuck off, that&#39;s just stupid,� to any Federal Statute. The closest a province has ever come to using this was on the �gay marriage� issue. Everyone&#39;s entire government had just been privatized, and their biggest concern appeared to be whether two dudes can marry.

I look at events like this and sometimes I can&#39;t help but think, �Maybe Menard&#39;s right. Maybe you do deserve it.�

Anyway, while you were all in a tizzy about whether a dude can wear a wedding dress and be taken seriously, other more sinister machinations were afoot.

His name is Ernst Z�ndel of Regina v. Z�ndel fame, and his story went something like this:

Ernst Z�ndel is one of those ideological pustules on society that invariably erupt when free speech is so vigorously protected. I&#39;ve read what Mr. Z�ndel has to say, and he cites reliable sources to support his position. This ignores the reality, and other evidence, that counters his position.

What&#39;s more reasonable to accept?

That the holocaust didn&#39;t happen? Or that Roma (gypsies), the mentally ill, the handicapped, the Muslims, the Jews, the homosexuals, and the political dissidents, were all rounded up and exterminated; and the Jews just whined about it the most. People doing stupid things at �crime scenes� don&#39;t help, and support idiots like Mr. Z�ndel. With only a little, tiny bit of probing, you will discover this fun fact regarding the holocaust. Those smoke-stacks on Auschwitz were built in 1947 for �dramatic effect�; and when pressured on it, every holocaust memorial foundation grudgingly admits this is true.

But back to Mr. Z�ndel....

Ernst Z�ndel was doing the Streisand effect, before Barbara Streisand made it cool.

After the constitution was ratified, parliament quickly set about whittling away your free speech rights, and Ernst Z�ndel happened to be in the right place at the right time. No one knew it then.

Now Ernst Z�ndel is a hateful little man; and he wants the world to know it. So much so, he decided you could avail yourself of his opinion by calling up his �976 Hate Speech Hotline�...for the low, low charge of ten dollars appearing on your phone bill, you could injest all the hate-mongering that would fit on an answering machine tape (Yes, a fucking tape. That&#39;s how long ago this shit happened).

People called up and he actually profited from being a hateful little man...and if the story ended there, you could reasonably think, �Fuck this is Canada. You can do anything�, and we&#39;d all live happily ever after.

After a couple of months of profiting from people with more money than brains, rumour of this great scam eventually fell on the ears of a Jew. See? Mel Gibson was right. Jews are always causing trouble. Well it came to pass, that this great scam did fall on the ear of a Jew, and attached to that ear of a Jew, was a Jew with a finger, which could dial a telephone; and for the bargain price of ten bucks...he could make history!

I freely admit that I wouldn&#39;t pass that shit up, so there&#39;s no way a Jew&#39;s going to. Remember the stereotypes kids, and be advised that Jews come to Scottish people to learn humility.

Do you guys see how many stereotypes I&#39;ve managed to jam into here so far?

As the result of this hilarious chain of events, Mr. Z�ndel became the dubious winner of the �First Man to be Charged with Hate Speech� prize. Under this �code� Mr. Z�ndel&#39;s position was indefensible, but he had an �ace up his sleeve�. He had studied the constitution and believed he had the right to do what he did. His lawyer, probably another Jew, saw dollar signs rocketing all the way to the Supreme Court, so he grabbed onto the Law Society&#39;s tit and sucked as hard as he could. This case plodded through the courts relentlessly, and ended up at the Supreme Court where they freely admitted that all hate speech laws are, by their very nature, unconstitutional. However, Nazis are �bad� so they decided to remove that right and blatantly ignore anything the constitution has to say, with an addendum pointing out that each administrative zone (province) has the right to exercise that �notwithstanding� clause nobody&#39;s ever dared use.

They&#39;ll save it for something important...like dudes getting married to each other. I say dudes because I refuse to accept the proposition that hot girl-on-girl action is NOT a human right.

These events marked the beginning of the slippery slope of rights removal all of you are just discovering now. It has been happening for a very long time.

Much has happened since the Z�ndel case. The public is slowly spoon-fed ridiculous concepts. The United States slipped even faster using our �enlightened� hate-speech laws as an example. Now there is a perfectly �legal� �War on Terror�. Americans are so stupid that they don&#39;t even realise they&#39;re making war on something that&#39;s not even an noun. �War on Drugs� at least meets the �noun� criterion. If you had to defend the �War on Drugs�, it&#39;s only defense would be, �At least we&#39;re making war on a noun.�

I&#39;ll let that sink in.

How many stupid �Patriotic Americans� don&#39;t realize there&#39;s a war on something that&#39;s not even a fucking noun. If I think you don&#39;t deserve to live for not realizing that, imagine how low you rank in the eyes of those who created this policy � all &#34;perfectly legal&#34;.

We need a Monarch dictator for a generation, to bitch-slap you back to reality. For, one of the other things that I don&#39;t hide, is the fact that I, and other privateers, commissioned the AQUILAE TRUST with the primary mandate: To assist in the restoration of executive power of the Monarchy, under the terms of the AQUILAE COVENANT.

Three generations ago, Princess Elizabeth called to the then recently-released slaves, to help her stop the Empire from being wiped-out by the Germans. And she is of German descent. That war left a legacy that is priceless. It formed the corner stone of civilization and brought us into a new Golden Age.

The laws of commerce work when everybody plays by the rules, and when everybody&#39;s rights are respected. For three decades I have screamed that this is not happening.

So I have set out to prove it to you. My goal is to show you all that there is no deception. They&#39;re just not playing by the rules any more. The people responsible for your chronic ignorance, jumped ship long ago. Now we&#39;re stuck with parrots and chimps, running a mighty, but decaying, infrastructure.

Just remember this is on an exponential curve too.

I am doing my utmost to construct a lifeboat, and to detach you from all this. What I am constructing (to paraphrase Q from Star Trek) has wonders to satiate all desires, both subtle and gross. But it&#39;s not for the timid.

Here is my court room position in a nutshell.

You do not accept surety � EVER.

Step 1: Reserve all rights. (get Derek Moran to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)

Step 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed. Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS. If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.

Anything outside of this supports their position that you are �playing� their game, and thus it is presumed that you understand the rules. The only way to counter this is to declare that you CANNOT UNDERSTAND the rules without these questions being answered.

Think very carefully about this. If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling
and its rules, you might raise the obvious question, �Why do you get to move two pieces?� If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?

If you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that&#39;s when you&#39;re going to �understand� that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game. You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert.

Novice drivers and expert drivers all have to follow the same rules. You don&#39;t get to ignore rules because you suck at them. Just as my chess board is not a chess school, the court will not allow the presumption that you being a novice is a lawful excuse. The only method to extract yourself �with honour� is to accept responsibility for the mistake in presumption. They are presuming something wrong...and you are acknowledging it&#39;s your fault. The court must accept this MISTAKE, and your entreaty for forgiveness for the unintended debt created. The court MUST do this.

Your name should never come into it. Your name is but a piece of evidence in a much larger presumption that the court has the right to attach a name derived from a public document, to a living man. This, of course, is untrue. The court knows it&#39;s not their right. That&#39;s why in the Mary Croft days, the quote �living man� argument worked. But these are trimming at the branches of the poisonous tree in an attempt to make it look pretty. The only solution is to target the root. The root is accounting and surety; there&#39;s no farther to dig down.

You have all heard the quote, �I am not a number. I am a free man.� This came from the profoundly subversive British television series, The Prisoner, which exposes the Noble Lie in the most blunt and obvious way possible, without using the actual words. If you take the time and watch this series, you can see very clearly, knowing what you know so far, exactly how everything is. The protagonist, played by Patrick McGoohan, who truly supports the concept that acting is an art form, is only ever identified as �Number 6�. The highest ranking officer in the prison is only �Number 2�, whose character keeps changing; none of them ever answering the constantly-posed question, �Who is &#39;Number ONE&#39;?�

And...because I fucking-love giving away the ending...

�Number ONE� turns out to be a delusion of the protagonist&#39;s own making, whom others around him exploited; all to answer the question, �Why did you resign?� I want you to think about that as you go down this path.

You will be pursued by the people you once served, and you will be asked, �Why did you resign?� To answer is to become �salvage�. You never learned why �Number 6� �resigned�, because his position is what your position should be as regards government.

NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS!

If you want to be even more hostile reach for a �Scott-ism�, FOR WHATEVER REASON OFFENDS YOU THE MOST!

So there&#39;s your homework. Read this article over, and over, and over again. Just so there&#39;s no confusion, I am communicating on several levels here. Whoever is reading this, pay close attention to what I say.

That&#39;s it. Scroll to the top, and read again.

THE TENDER FOR LAW � LIVE EXAMPLE #001 � PROPER NOTICE FOR IDIOTS (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

TONIGHT&#39;S TOPIC: PROPER NOTICE

In one of the many ongoing AQUILAE initiatives, I have cause to produce a NOTICE.

Since I&#39;m using THE TENDER FOR LAW as a notebook for my students, I figure I might as well �kill two birds with one stone� by discussing the aspects of NOTICE here, more specifically PROPER NOTICE.

As a secondary objective we shall learn the difference between a GIFT and a COURTESY.

*spoiler alert* - Courtesy doesn&#39;t mean what you think it means, because like money a COURTESY is, in fact, a...

...TENDER FOR LAW!

As long as there have been professions, there have been LAWs governing them; and a courtesy is one of the oldest tenders for LAW, because it governs the oldest profession. You see, my friends, COURTESIES are for COURTESANS, because THEY&#39;RE THE ONES GETTING FUCKED. If you ACCEPT a COURTESY, you accept that you&#39;re the one getting fucked. I can&#39;t put it any simpler. This is why you NEVER accept courtesies from the government.

The GOVERNMENT is not a PERSON.

The COURT is not a PERSON.

...and if you accept a courtesy from the court, you are putting it on the PUBLIC RECORD that in ALL LEGAL EXCHANGES, YOU&#39;RE THE ONE GETTING FUCKED!

A GIFT, on the other hand...

... is exactly what you think it means.

Digressing from the spoiler alert (because when I �spoil� it&#39;s hard core), and returning to the NOTICE, I shall now discuss the practical aspects of PROPER NOTICE. We&#39;ll start with one of the simplest notices:

KEEP OFF THE GRASS.

Is this PROPER NOTICE?

Yes it is, however the LEGAL strength of this notice is dependent on WHERE THE NOTICE IS. The terms of the notice, �KEEP OFF THE GRASS�, is far different for a PUBLIC PARK than say, for example... A HOUSE FULL OF RUSSIAN MOBSTERS. Ignoring the NOTICE has DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES depending on WHERE IT IS. If you are going to wield LAW, your NUMBER ONE GOAL SHOULD BE TO REMOVE VARIABLES, and I have just described a big one!

How do you remove this variable?

Let&#39;s look at another PUBLIC NOTICE that all of us have seen.

NO PARKING

On the surface, �NO PARKING� and �KEEP OFF THE GRASS� are functionally the same, however, unlike �KEEP OFF THE GRASS�, a �NO PARKING� sign will also give you notice as to WHO PUT IT THERE. This removes the variables that �KEEP OFF THE GRASS� has.

We have removed the question as to WHO is saying this, and as a byproduct, the consequences of ignoring the notice. As I&#39;ve mentioned throughout the TENDER FOR LAW, the question �WHO are you?� puts the court in the most jeopardy. Identifying WHO you are when giving a notice creates what&#39;s called �PROPER NOTICE�. The primary goal of a LEGAL document is to remove all possible variables to accomplish its goal. �NO PARKING� is pretty specific. It reduces the variables to �PARKED�, and �NOT PARKED�. �NOT PARKED� is the GOAL of the notice. �PARKED� is something to be discouraged.

If it is a TRUST and not a PERSON WHO posts the NOTICE, it is what is known as a BY-LAW. This means that should you choose (of your own free will) to interact with the TRUST, you are subject to the BY-LAWS. TRUST LAW is the HIGHEST LAW. It trumps ADMIRALTY LAW. It trumps CANON LAW. It is the HIGHEST LAW.

Thus endeth the preamble. Let&#39;s draw us up a NOTICE.

In this particular case a VESSEL has been LAWFULLY transferred to the AQUILAE TRUST.

As this VESSEL is NOT in AQUILAE&#39;s custody, a PUBLIC NOTICE must be given laying CLAIM to the VESSEL. This permanently curtails any SALVAGE RIGHTS on said VESSEL. If you construct a VESSEL it is VERILY YOUR RIGHT to transfer ownership of said VESSEL, but one must remember, one does not own the SOUL of the VESSEL, and should the SOUL speak, their word is LAW. If you want to find this LAW, you have only to look in the CAPTAIN&#39;s Log; for the CAPTAIN is the SOUL in question.

Now like every other LEGAL document, the first line on the LEGAL document MUST state what the document is.

CERTIFICATES, BONDS and NOTES are often mistakenly called LEGAL DOCUMENTS, when their actual LEGAL status is, �VALUABLE INSTRUMENT�. It&#39;s not �LEGAL INSTRUMENT� because �LEGAL� does not indicate VALUE. The name itself, says what it is; an INSTRUMENT you can attach VALUE to. But we&#39;re not dealing with �VALUABLE INSTRUMENTS�, because we are transferring this VESSEL from the LOWEST LAW (ADMIRALTY) to the HIGHEST LAW (TRUST). This pulls it out of the ADMIRALTY JURISDICTION.

I&#39;m sure some of you are putting this together already, so I&#39;ll just give away the ending, because I&#39;m a total dick that way.

In ADMIRALTY, on land, you are considered a �VESSEL� in dry dock. You&#39;re not a corporation, you&#39;re a boat in the eyes of ADMIRALTY LAW. You are a VESSEL �ON-THE-HARD� in marine slang. If you are ever in a marina you will notice that the marina leaves everybody who is docked, alone. They won&#39;t speak to the CAPTAINS unless spoken to, and the CAPTAINS are given the utmost respect...

...until they pull your boat out of the water.

When the VESSEL is �ON-THE-HARD� you are now in the marina&#39;s �CUSTODY�, and your STATUS is very, very, different; and this, above all, is why you treat the HARBOUR MASTER with the highest respect. My experience has shown that doing this ALWAYS pays off...

...but I digress.

Let&#39;s construct the first line of our document.

The first line of the document MUST state WHAT IT IS.

Since this is intended to be a PUBLIC NOTICE, it makes sense that �PUBLIC NOTICE� be the first line. There is now no confusion as to what this document IS, and WHO it is . It is not addressing a particular INDIVIDUAL. This means if you give a PUBLIC NOTICE to an INDIVIDUAL, you are DEEMED to have done so as a COURTESY. You&#39;ve already read the spoiler so I&#39;m not building the plot up.

As a courtesy, a copy of this PUBLIC NOTICE (with some redacted shit filled in) will be sent by registered mail to a LAWYER who mistakenly BELIEVES he/she/it has INTEREST in the VESSEL. As an extra COURTESY, a copy of the LIEN on the VESSEL will be included, because we at AQUILAE, if nothing else, are very, very, COURTEOUS.

The next line in any LEGAL DOCUMENT must list any PARTIES being referred to. Since this is a PUBLIC NOTICE there are no PARTIES to list. Therefore PUBLIC NOTICE meets all LEGAL obligation.

After this point in the document, all UNDERTAKINGS must be listed.

So if I posted a PUBLIC NOTICE, I am, in fact, POSTING A BILL. A BILL is also a TENDER FOR LAW. When you receive a BILL for your meal, your ACCEPTANCE makes it LAW.

When you give an ORDER, you have pre-accepted the LAW, and the BILL is simply a FORMality (Everybody GET THAT?).

A BILL in PARLIAMENT is supposedly ordered by the CITIZENS, or �DEEMED ORDERED� by the CITIZENS. This is why the phrase, �POST NO BILLS�, is often found on temporary structures with flat surfaces. �POST NO BILLS� = �POST NO TENDERS FOR LAW�; This means you have been PROPERLY NOTIFIED (PROPER NOTICE because a BILL is a TENDER FOR LAW).

THERE ARE NO HOMONYMS IN LAW

THERE ARE NO SYNONYMS IN LAW

For instance, BILL C1,1985 is a BILL nobody accepted, simply because there&#39;s no sane person that would accept, THE INCOME TAX ACT.

This act has been AMENDED MANY, MANY TIMES, but has never been ACCEPTED into LAW, and like the deluded Christians you&#39;ll find on Dean&#39;s Facebook page, the GOVERNMENT will pretend not to know this, and will IGNORE/ATTACK those who point it out or give PROPER NOTICE.

This is one of the dirtiest �hidden-in-plain-sight� secrets in LAW. The Income Tax Act that was once LAW, for the purpose of paying for the war, expired DECADES AGO, and people just kept paying.

They govern these PAYMENTS OF IGNORANCE through an OUTSOURCED THIRD-PARTY. Douglas Levitt didn&#39;t come into my home with a gun. Cowards don&#39;t do that, and ALL LAWYERS ARE COWARDS. These are strangers who harm people for money. Only cowards choose such a profession. If they wish to inflict violence, they outsource to a third-party, and pay them...

Where was I? OH YES! I remember...

THEREFORE having received PROPER NOTICE (PROPER NOTICE = KNOWLEDGE under LAW), you now KNOW that, should you POST a TENDER FOR LAW, it is NOT REASONABLE TO BELIEVE your TENDER FOR LAW will be there at a LATER TIME.

However in our case, we are going to POST our PUBLIC NOTICE by way of the POSTAL SERVICE.

The POSTal SERVICE (Everybody GET THAT?)

The POSTAL SERVICE is a service provided for POSTING TENDERS FOR LAW. So when you send a REGISTERED letter via the POSTAL SERVICE, this service also BEARS WITNESS (and gives a RECEIPT for it) to the fact that NOTICE was posted to a specific PARTY.

Now; In the interest of time, I shall now draw out that PUBLIC NOTICE, because the PARTY I&#39;m drafting the document for, is wondering why I&#39;m not on the phone with him right now, drafting it with him.

Drafting documents in public is a lot like fucking in public. Many parties will consider it in bad taste, some might even find it disgusting, but in the end it rarely happens, and it&#39;s fun to watch.

What? Am I wrong?

So let&#39;s draft this document RIGHT NOW.

***BEGIN***

PUBLIC NOTICE

TAKE NOTICE that the VESSEL known as ***redacted shit here*** is now the LAWFUL PROPERTY of the AQUILAE TRUST per the wishes of ***redacted shit here***&#39;S CREATOR and GRANTOR.

Therefore: LET IT BE KNOWN THAT AS OF THIS DATE, BEING FEBRUARY 18, 2013, THE VESSEL KNOWN AS ***redacted shit here*** MUST BE CONSIDERED A PRIVATE VESSEL WITH NO COMMERCE EXPECTED AND/OR IMPLIED.

PARTIES ATTEMPTING TO USE ***redacted shit here*** FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES MAY BE FINED AT THE RATE OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY ($5,000 PER DAY) OR ANY PART THEREOF, FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE.

Questions regarding this NOTICE may be addressed to the DULY AUTHORIZED TRUSTEE CORPORATION, [ROGUESUPPORT INC.] at (416) 994-1700.

AQUILAE TRUST SEAL (Insert lower right)

***END***

And there&#39;s everything you need for A NOTICE.

Viewing women who are �lubed up� by this awesomeness are, of course, invited to drop by for a ride. Extra points if you show up in a �Naughty Schoolgirl� outfit.

    Scott on the CHANGE OF NAME ACT/WAIVING THE LEGAL NAME significance- thread.....

THE TENDER FOR LAW � SURETY FOR IDIOTS - PART II - WAIVING THE LEGAL NAME (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

THE FOLLOWING is an ENHANCED and TENDER FOR LAW ANNOTATED [In Square Brackets] version of section 2.1 of The ONTARIO &#34;Change of Name Act&#34; [R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER C.7... see what I did there? PAY ATTENTION TO CAPS HERE, as these are the words to look for where YOUR &#34;change of name act&#34; is.]

2. (1) For ALL [ALL purposes! Pay attention to that] purposes of ONTARIO LAW,

(a) a person whose birth is registered in Ontario is ENTITLED [Which means you want to WAIVE this.] to be recognized by the NAME appearing on the PERSON&#39;S BIRTH CERTIFICATE or change of name certificate, unless clause (c) applies;

(b) a person whose birth is not registered in Ontario is ENTITLED[Which means you want to WAIVE this.] to be recognized by,

(i) the name appearing on the person�s change of name certificate, if the person�s name has been changed under this Act or a predecessor of it, or

(ii) in all other cases, the name recognized in law in the last place with which the person had a real and substantial connection before residing in Ontario,

unless clause (c) applies; and

(c) a person who adopted a name on marriage before the 1st day of April, 1987 is entitled to be recognized by that name unless the person subsequently changed that name under this Act or a predecessor of it. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.7, s. 2 (1).

So always WAIVE the BENEFIT of section 2.1 of the CHANGE OF NAME ACT.

Any name you are known by is PRIVATE, and NOT DERIVED from a PUBLIC DOCUMENT. Don&#39;t be surety for a THING.

I WAIVE THE BENEFIT OF SECTION 2.1 OF THE ONTARIO CHANGE OF NAME ACT. BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU ADDRESS ME BY ANY NAME, AND/OR, ANY INFORMATION DERIVED FROM ANY PUBLIC DOCUMENT?

    Scott&#39;s REQUIRED VIEWING: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P7izAUe3ZM&amp;feature=youtu.be

Scott Duncan Paul&#39;s BEST YET. It shows you what we are building.

Scott Duncan You become &#34;valuable&#34; by USING THE MONEY!

How simple is that? 

Scott Duncan It gets simpler. The problem is...THEN you get to see how dumb people REALLY are. People have fucked things up BIG TIME.

Icbeonne Senama care to elaborate?

Scott Duncan HONEST MONEY IS THE GOAL! Make it WORTHLESS to banks (unless they want to play too ) and DEPENDABLE for YOU.

Scott Duncan I tried to fix CIBC in the 90&#39;s and turn it into something useful. I failed, but I got laid a lot, so there&#39;s that.

Icbeonne Senama Funny! At least you tried...

Scott Duncan That&#39;s ALL I&#39;ve done. 30 years, with some success, and LOTS of failures. I have lost over $27 MILLION in my efforts.

Scott Duncan This one&#39;s my last push.

After that, I move onto genetic solutions.

Scott Duncan Basically if you aren&#39;t part of the monetary system we deploy... you die. Literally. Figuratively.

In 2 generations the people will be thinned out enough that we won&#39;t have the problems/damage that we do now.

There WILL come a point, where I say &#34;WAKE UP, or DIE&#34;... and I&#39;ll have something to back it up.

Then people will use an HONEST money system as if their lives depended on it...because their lives WILL depend on it.

Scott Duncan What? Too creepy?

Scott Duncan Best get THIS one right then, hadn&#39;t you?

Because I WILL solve this problem one way or another. 

Derek Moran Just finished watching this.. think the most important words in it come at minute 37:47 - &#34;...made in the knowledge, that only rarely, does anyone ever ask, for REAL Gold...the REAL Gold was seldom CLAIMED, allowing fraudulent PROMISES(to pay) of GOLD(Bank of Canada-legal tender-promissory note-fiat money-bank notes), to be made and used as (so-called) &#39;MONEY&#39;...&#34;

Derek Moran &#34; I have lost over $27 MILLION in my efforts...This one&#39;s my last push.&#34;

..how much will it cost to get THEM to honour PART V. of the Bills of Exchange Act 1985, CONSUMER NOTE/BILL/PURCHASES ?

Scott Duncan It&#39;s irrelevant. The damage is on a GENERAL Ledger somewhere. Why would I care. If I put a knife in somebody with the intention to kill them, and it WORKS...do I really care about the mechanics?

Scott Duncan BitCoin was deployed to prove the concept. Nothing else. It&#39;s not even scalable. Wait until you see what&#39;s COMING 

Chad Brodgesell: Every thing is a promise to pay until you accept it as payment.

I promise to pay you this cow for that chicken. Until the exchange is complete, it&#39;s Promissary.

I promise to give you this $100.00 dollar bill for that Ipod.

I would question not what debt is but rather WHO&#39;S debt it is. If it isn&#39;t mine then I don&#39;t give a rats a** what it is. (Scott clicked &#39;Like&#39; on this)

Chad Brodgesell: MONEY as DEBT is like the UCC, What do you care of it if you have nothing to do with it. Just my OPINION by the way. (Scott clicked &#39;Like&#39; on this)

Chad Brodgesell: Ever hear about the Guy in Germany in 1930 something that went to the bank with a wheel barrel full of cash to deposit it. He turned to open the door and when he turned back Thieves had taken his wheel barrel, left the cash on the ground. (Scott clicked &#39;Like&#39; on this)

Scott Duncan: It also covers the creation of DIGITAL currency.

Use MATH instead of a &#34;central authority&#34;.

One can only &#34;Believe&#34; in a &#34;Central Authority&#34;.

One can TRUST math.

Scott Duncan: You are thinking properly, Chad.

REMEMBER, the ONLY time you NEED money is when you are SPENDING it.

Chad Brodgesell: &#39;When do you need Money?&#39; I took a tenth time look at it and come up with this.

All the money in the world and you still starve/freeze/get rained on whatever.

You NEED MONEY when You NEED/WANT something and Someone else has what You NEED/WANT but will only accept MONEY in exchange .

The action of the transfer of value is the SPENDING part. (Scott clicked &#39;Like&#39; on this)

Scott Duncan The ONLY time you need money is when you are spending it. The rest of the time, its debt and obligation.

Scott Duncan I would like strippers to blow me every morning while I do my morning routine... We don&#39;t always get what we want.

IF YOU HAVE VALUE, YOU SET THE TERMS. This has nothing to DO with the value of others (Which is what rent is).

If you need ME to do anything, you will need to pay me in BITCOIN. I simply don&#39;t accept anything else. If I get enough of them, I can exchange them for any other currency, at a VERY competitive rate, to pay for things of value offered by others. The only difference is that YOU use a different currency than everyone else.

No magic. Just jurisdiction.

Scott Duncan Remember when I said sometime back, that diving into this without understanding will reveal that you have no value? Well this is proof of that.

  <div class="py-4 whitespace-pre-line">
    OK��here is what I have learned in here, so far�..I think it�s AMAZING, but that is just �ME�, ALL of this, from a STRANGER on the internet :D

1). I am a MAN, and I have a PERSON.

2). Bank Notes are TENDERS for some Legal stuff.

3). Bank Notes are meant to be used by PERSONS.

4). I am the SOLE authorized Administrator for the person named PIERRE DAOUST.

5). If that person uses BANK NOTES, it has to declare having using it.

6). That person will get taxed having using these bank notes.

7). These taxes will be sent to the person in form of PUBLIC DEBTS.

8). I have the right to buy back these debts, and pay for them

9). I have the right to administrate these debts and get them discharged via the person�s surety.

10). I have administrated 11 of these debts so far, ALL PUBLIC DEBTS.

11). I have administrated PUBLIC utility bills, Federal income tax bill, Quebec income tax bills, scholar tax bills, traffic tickets bills, Ambulance Bill, School bills.

12). I also received an offer to take a new picture of my face, to put it on 2 pieces of identifications.

13). Problem is, these IDs, identifies the person, and not me.

14). I have NOTIFIED them, to make sure they understand the I have no problem putting MY face on these, but it is strictly to identify the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR of that said person.

15). I also asked them to tell me which birth date they need, MINE, or the persons birth date, I know them two :D, and can prove them two :D

16). I have learned that I AM a supreme being, and that I can write the law.

17). I also learned that I have lots of determination.

18). I also learned that I can be lazy as hell :D

19). I also learned that I am a BELLIGERENT 

20). I also learned that this game is all about surety and who accounts for it.

21). I also learned that I have to act with Respect, Honor, Dignity and Integrity with �ME

22). I also learned that I am a LEADER, and I have the ability to find other LEADERS.

23). My goal now, is to spread the truth, and find other leaders to do the same.

24). Thank you Scott Duncan ;)

25). I am sure I forget something :D

P.S. I also learned that some stupid thugs will try to fuck around with the surety of the person I happen to have in my pocket, that�s seems to be inevitable� :D

Muhahahahaha!!!! :D

FFFFFREEEEEEDDDDUMMMMMMBBBBBBBBB !!!! :D :D

    I have made a LOT of money in my life.

I only keep what I needed. The rest was spent back into the economy, or reinvested in whatever venture I was supporting. 

If you get &#34;wealth&#34;, GET RID OF IT. The WORST part about being &#34;rich&#34; is that you have to hang around rich people. These people truly are the worst humanity has to offer.

Here&#39;s why it&#39;s ok to kill them: They&#39;d do it to you in a second.

    Scott on the mindset of those who get PAID BY US to HARM US and see NO PROBLEM with that &#39;mini-article&#39;...

REMEMBER; We�re all supposedly �equal under the law�, but reality doesn�t seem to play that out exactly. It seems everyone is ok with their rights and liberties violated by those holding the public trust. All they do to justify that is spout weasel-word catch phrases:

�There is a court ORDER� (It doesn�t matter if there IS. It just has to be �believed�)

�I�m just doing my job�

�It�s all perfectly legal�

So, all of us being equal under the law, does that mean you, the average man/woman can use the same bullshit excuses?

NO?

Why not? It�s not like anyone is ever called to account for this shit. Those that do, get �paid leave�.

When do we get what we�ve paid for?

Never, of course.

This was done in Nazi Germany in the early 30�s. There was a free press, LGBT advocacy, and over 30 Publishers that reached over 50,000 subscribers. As rights declined, the �citizens� noticed and started speaking up. The response was a more aggressive authoritarian policy, where violence against citizens was commonplace. Finally, when people started fighting back, it was merely used as an excuse for even MORE restrictions, and the �Authorities� were even MORE blatant�

...and you know what happens THEN.

At NO time in history has �Protesting� EVER worked. Stop thinking that�s the answer. It isn�t. They don�t care how �peaceful� you are. You are just noisy cattle to them. People work for the government because they can�t get a job in the real world, and because they get PAID (It USED to be a PRIVILEGE and an HONOUR to hold these positions) they actually consider you �less� than them, and that they are entitled to harm those people who pay their salaries INVOLUNTARILY. REMEMBER, EVERY CENT A COP MAKES WAS TAKEN BY FORCE FROM YOU. Since they got away with that, they feel it�s their �right� to deny you your rights.

This is happening RIGHT NOW, and nobody notices, or cares.

Stop �protesting�! To do so, BY DEFAULT, acknowledges their �Authority� and they are trying to get you to �fight back� in a REAL way so they can take the rest of your freedoms away.
War is coming. Get used to �change�... and not the good kind.

    YES I GOT ARRESTED...for fail to appear!...I arrived at the court house 12 min late and the judge signed a warrant for the arrest of DEAN KORY so when the 5 uniformed officers saw me ,they grabbed me! I went in front of the JP for a bail hearing and he remanded me into custody for 2 days and I was held at the Lindsay Jail for a bail hearing this morning where I argued that I could not possibly &#34;APPEAR&#34; even if I was there on time...the court information read &#34;fail to ATTEND&#34;,the charge reads&#34;fail to APPEAR&#34; so I said &#34;if you want me to APPEAR than the inference would be that I must have disappeared first&#34; I was released with the fail to appear STAYED!

    My rant on my page, made me wonder who here celebrates Xmas? Scott Duncan i would assume you dont because its a sky daddy celebration ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I dont care much at all for CHRIST-MASS , i just really dont care to run around on a HAMSTER WHEEL ALL MY LIFE, over and over and over non stop, looping like a bad record. Does no one else wanna get off this ride that keeps going around, no one is sick of it ? If you were on a ride that kept spinning you im sure you could get sick. Year after year for the rest of your life your going to keep praising and celebrating these so called holidays ? Such a strange/odd and off way of living a life, at what point does one get tired of doing the same thing over and over, season after season, halloween valentines day, xmas, new years, st patty day, easter etc..etc...i sit back in aw of the HOLY F__k that goes on, all the guilt tripping if you dont spend spend spend. If you spent as much time worrying about this planet as you do about the gifts you will get or give, there might be a big change. All that effort in looking and wondering and shopping, could be spent actually leaning your rights and how to make some real change. Its all personal choice, free will and all. Just really surprising the amount of willingness to keep on keeping on there is in society. My rant on that, just because i dont follow any of those hamster wheel events doesnt make me better than anyone else, just exercising my own personal choice is all.

    Hi everyone, i just posted this on my wall and thought i&#39;d share it with you.

The Noble Lie
[I]ts 3 days after the winter solstice, the SUN (son) has risen again.
and YOU are praising AMEN RA the sun god, as all good christians do.
because someone told (sold) you a lie so big you believed it.

like good little sheep, following a trail right to the slaughter house.

servant to any means servant. you think you are inferior, and therefore someonelse smarter can take advantage of that. you good little lamb.

yummy tasty lamb, poor thing. and they are laughing at you the whole time because they put the truth right out there for you to see, only instead of SEEing it you chose to ignore reality for he pleasure of a false hope.

because it made you FEEL GOOD.

and when I show you the proof, you call me crazy because you dont feel good anymore. the truth is killing your rapist FEELS GOOD even if it is a lot of hard work. Liberty and Freedom are something just as invisible you allways have to fight to defend. CHOOSE one. serve yourself or servant.

happy merry bullshit day

MERRY RAPE-BABY BIRTHDAY!

There&#39;s too many useless fucks and cops here. SO! Here&#39;s the deal:

EVERY MEMBER MUST post something they learned HERE that is TRUE, BEYOND ANY DOUBT. If you are a member here, then you should have learned SOMETHING. TELL ME HERE, within the NEXT 72 HOURS!

This is NOT a drill. Lurkers will be purged.

    I am not understanding what is going on with these court cases I have.  NO ONE will answer a single question I have asked specifically regarding the questions on the Notice of Mistake.  Yet, if I don&#39;t show up to these tribunals, they send out there bouncers to arrest ME.  

Again, I received a letter from the court today which says &#34;the Defendant falls within the definition of Person&#34;.  And the definition of Person in the Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 4 Section 7 is &#34;association, partnership, corporation, or society&#34;.  

Perhaps the &#34;Defendant&#34; falls within this definition, but not the Justice, DA, or Cops have said how that could be ME.  

I am confused as to what the next step is.  They CLEARLY have no intent on finding the Surety in the matter, they ONLY want to &#34;proceed&#34; against ME.  Do I issue another Notice of Mistake? (I have good reasons to believe that they don&#39;t care about these questions at this point)  Do I find the Surety and send a bill for doing it? (of course, properly notify them first)  Or what else...?

It seems EVERYONE else using the Notice of Mistake is having very favorable results, but not me.  They keep fucking with me.  

What are some thoughts that others have?

    The US has a higher percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world: 
more than China, more than Russia, more than any backwater dictatorship.  

Roughly 1 out of every 142 US residents is behind bars. 

This gulag system is fantastically profitable for the companies that build and manage prisons...for the companies that supply them...for the prison guard unions...and for the state itself which sells prison labor to private corporations for pennies on the dollar. 

Who are these two million plus people behind bars in the US? 

Are they all monsters the public has to be protected from or has incarceration become an addictive business for the state?

Is that&#39;s the case, how safe are any of us in the long run? 

These are questions a freedom loving people should be asking itself. 

A unique perspective on inmates and prisons

    Back in the summer Scott had shown us a picture of the HMCS YORK. It was said if you look, you will find one in your area.

I looked for the thread that was posted in, however I was unable to find it.

In a conversation last night with my Brother in Law, I discovered the one here in London, Ont.

Here she is.. The HMCS PROVOST.

On Thursday 27 December it was reported by Reuters that Barclays �accidentally lost� 10 years of instant chat message data, over the period LIBOR was known to be rigged, killing off any serious hopes of a prosecution for USD LIBOR manipulation.

&#34;Accidentally lost&#34; this data, MY ASTROLABE!!

 This is abso-flipping-lutely unbelievable: and please note: no one at Barclay&#39;s goes to prison for this!!

    BITCOIN IS EVIL... because you can&#39;t pay government thugs with it.

No really!

I&#39;m not making this up!

�Fiat money is backed by men with guns, bitcoin is not...� -Paul Krugman
Yet bitcoin is &#34;evil&#34;.  SERIOUSLY?

JUST IN CASE you are thinking this ass-hat&#39;s &#34;opinion&#34; is worth anything: This is the same guy that &#34;predicted&#34; in 1998 that the Internet would be irrelevant by 2005.

No really. He said it would be because people have nothing to say to each other.

The Super Power Collapse Soup...

Here&#39;s a guy who lived in the USSR before and during its collapse and in the US now.

He sees many obvious parallels. It&#39;s hard to disagree...

    &#34;You should still be ONLY making DEPOSITS!
Stop looking for shit and pay attention to the LEGAL MECHANICS. DEPOSITS are not INCOME. INCOME tax is for INCOME, not DEPOSITS. That is all you need to know.&#34;

I got this from Mackximus&#39; &#34;Gold Nuggets&#34; document and I have good reasons to think Scott wrote it.  My CPA&#39;s have always wanted the reconciled bank statements to determine &#34;INCOME&#34;.  They claim that &#34;DEPOSITS&#34; are &#34;INCOME&#34; and &#34;CHECKS&#34; (outgoing money) are &#34;EXPENSES&#34;.  Then they subtract the difference and tax it.  (Maybe a little more happens after that, but you get it) 

Is this because my corporations in the past weren&#39;t &#34;Trust Holding Companies&#34;?
